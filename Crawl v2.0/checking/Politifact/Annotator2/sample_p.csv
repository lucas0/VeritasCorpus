Anthony List, announced a $50,000 radio ad buy targeting Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe for his opposition to common ground abortion center health and safety standards. Last year, the Virginia Health Commissioner reported to the Board of Health that more than 80 violations were discovered in abortion centers across the Commonwealth. The ad will run on Adult and Soft Contemporary and Newstalk stations in the Northern Virginia, Richmond and Norfolk media markets for two weeks. “In light of Kermit Gosnell’s ‘house of horrors,’ it is an outrage that anyone who purports to care about women would oppose efforts to ensure that Virginia women are treated with basic dignity and respect. More than 80 violations have been discovered in Virginia abortion clinics including blood-stained equipment and operating tables, improper disposal of fetal remains, staff failure to properly sanitize instruments, and even doctors performing exams with unwashed hands,” said Mallory Quigley, spokesperson for Women Speak Out Virginia. “Despite evidence that these common ground health and safety standards are needed, Terry McAuliffe refuses to defect from his abortion industry allies, who have vigorously fought these pro-woman efforts from the beginning. The Women Speak Out Virginia PAC will be calling out Terry McAuliffe’s shameful opposition to protecting Virginia’s women until Election Day.”A script of the radio ad follows:In the race for Governor…there’s one candidate who has taken extreme positions far outside the mainstream….one candidate whose radical ideas are troubling to every woman in Virginia.It’s Terry McAuliffe.Just this month Terry McAuliffe opposed basic health and safety standards for some women’s health clinics that perform abortions.McAuliffe refuses to require women’s health clinics to provide the same sanitary environment we expect of dental offices and hospitals.McAuliffe is bowing to the political pressure from powerful corporations that run women’s health clinics.They must think they are above the law. They put their own interests above the health of safety of their patients.Virginia women’s clinics have been cited for unsanitary conditions, poor staff training, and poorly maintained equipment.But Terry McAuliffe is afraid to stand up for women’s health. He’s afraid to stand up for you.Career politician Terry McAuliffe is too extreme for Virginia.Paid for by Women Speak Out Virginia. Not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s committee.Last month, McAuliffe’s campaign was asked by the Washington Post to confirm or deny his stance on abortion as being one of supporting “a platform of abortion on-demand at any time, for any reason, paid for by Virginia taxpayers,” including “sex-selective abortion, late-term abortion, partial-birth abortion, and abortions on teenage girls without parental consent – all paid for by Virginia taxpayers.” McAuliffe spokesman Josh Schwerin declined to comment to the Post.Women Speak Out Virginia is an affiliated PAC of the Susan B. Anthony List. The SBA List and its affiliated Political Action Committees are dedicated to pursuing policies and electing candidates who will reduce and ultimately end abortion. To that end, the SBA List emphasizes the education, promotion, mobilization, and election of pro-life women. The SBA List is a network of more than 365,000 pro-life Americans nationwide.

But Sen. Rob Portman mentioned one that was new to us during a conference call with reporters.He was actually talking about student loans, but in answer to a question from WSPD radio in Toledo, Portman said:""The truth is, by the way, you know part of the health care bill is paid for by the administration taking the difference of what (interest rate) they can borrow at, and what most students pay, and putting some of that money into the health care bill.""He repeated that ""we took from students and paid for a new entitlement program we can't afford."" And he rephrased it by saying ""the health care bill was paid for in part by taking money out of the student loan system.""Portman’s comments, made April 28, were in support of a Republican proposal to extend low-interest student loan rates (3.4 percent) for another year. Republican lawmakers would do that by taking money out of the 2010 health care law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Specifically, the money would come from a fund in the health bill that covers prevention and public health.We’re not here to debate whether that’s good policy. But Portman, acknowledging Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander’s leadership role in the GOP proposal, suggested something fresh to our ears: the notion that Obamacare, as it is commonly called, used student loan money.PolitiFact Ohio decided to learn more.Students once were considered a poor lending risk. To prime the pump and expand educational opportunities, the federal government in 1965 decided to guarantee student loans against default. The government also guaranteed a certain interest rate to the banks, even if the rates students paid were lower. And the government paid additional fees to the banks for administration and collection of student loans.This wound up providing a lucrative revenue stream for the banks, while putting millions of Americans through college.But the system required billions of dollars in federal subsidies, and some in Washington, especially Democrats, started looking at alternatives. What if the government cut out the middle man (the banks) and gave loans directly to students through their colleges’ financial aid offices? Those offices already helped process most loans anyway. By getting rid of the subsidies, the government could save billions and use the money for more financial aid for needy students, Democrats said.Various pilot programs were tried. Some universities, including Ohio State, said they liked dealing directly with the government. But plenty of others liked the special attention private lenders gave them, and the private lenders spent millions lobbying Congress to keep the subsidy system.This debate dragged on for years. Then in early 2010, Democrats found the opening they needed to permanently move away from subsidizing the lenders. It coincided with passage of the Affordable Care Act.The Senate generally needs 60 votes to overcome filibusters and objections to legislation. Democrats lacked that number. So they decided to employ a seldom-used tactic involving budgets and government spending, known as ""reconciliation."" Reconciliation only requires 51 votes. That’s how Senate Democrats were able to pass a combined student loan-health care bill, the Reconciliation Act of 2010, on March 25, 2010, with 56 votes.You might not have heard much about the student loan portion at the time, because health care, a monumental social initiative, consumed most of the oxygen in Washington. But the two were connected through the reconciliation bill, which is where we come back to Portman’s claim.Did one component, student loans, help pay for health care? The answer is not as simple as it sounds.According to the Congressional Budget Office, the government was going to save $58 billion from the student loan program, over a 10-year period, by eliminating the middle man. That would provide enough money to put an additional $36 billion into Pell grants and $3 billion more into several other programs, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Even after these investments, the government would have $19 billion left, the CBO said.So was this $19 billion going into Obamacare? That’s what Portman’s press secretary, Christine Mangi, initially suggested when we first asked about Portman’s statement.The problem with that assumption is that the CBO did not show it that way.It showed the $19 billion as savings, or a net reduction in the federal deficit. And several budget experts we spoke with said that’s exactly where the $19 billion was going.The CBO also showed $124 billion in additional savings from the health care portion of the reconciliation act, thanks to new revenue, taxes and projected savings on Medicare. Mangi was skeptical of this projection, as are other Republicans, saying the health care provisions are certain to cost much more than assumed in 2010, wiping out any savings. Where will the money come from then?It’ll come in part from the money the government got by changing its student-loan program, she said. She also noted that some private lenders used to provide interest-rate reductions for borrowers, and new borrowers won’t have that option. That’s speculation, however, and such private-bank incentives to students became fewer after the 2008 financial crisis. Still, we sought out budget and education officials on this, and then we called Alexander’s office.Alexander was secretary of education under President George H. W. Bush. His staff referred us to other CBO figures, but that just led to more dispute among budget experts over how to interpret the numbers. But then we found agreement -- from two key Senate offices on opposite sides of the aisle.Alexander’s office drew our attention to a statement made by Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, a leader on education issues. On March 23, 2010, on the Senate floor Harkin said that by ending the subsidies to banks, the government would have more money for Pell grants and historically black colleges. He also said that $10 billion would go for debt reduction.Notice that he said $10 billion? But wait -- wasn’t it supposed to be $19 billion, according to the CBO figures? So where did the other $9 billion go?It went to pay for a portion of health care reform, Alexander’s staff insisted.We turned to the staff of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which Harkin chairs. And at last, there was common ground. Harkin indeed said $10 billion would go for debt reduction. The other $9 billion, said committee spokeswoman Justine Sessions, went to help pay for expansion of community health centers, prescription drug access, and consumer protections in insurance.That’s $9 billion for health care out the student loan program.With that, we return to Portman’s claim -- that health care reform ""was paid for in part by taking money out of the student loan system.""Portman’s statement is partially accurate. The overall health care bill has hundreds of billions in features before revenue and tax offsets bring the costs down, if projections prove to be right. We’re not here to debate whether they will. Nine billion dollars is a tiny share. But Portman said ""in part,"" and that $9 billion is destined for health care, so he’s right there.But he suggested this is at the expense of students. That’s a big leap, leaving out important detail and context. The combined student loan-health care bill did not reduce the amount of money that students can borrow. It actually expanded the amount of money available for student aid. What it reduced is the banks’ share.""The money that was saved wasn't money that was going into education -- it was money that was subsidizing private banks,"" Sessions, of the education committee, said in an email. ""Period.""On the Truth-O-Meter, Portman’s claim rates Half True.Advertisement"

['Terrorism']	http://www.nydailynews.com/	http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ted-cruz-bill-bratton-wrong-terrorism-article-1.2580401	2016/05/09	NEW YORK DAILY NEWSMonday, March 28, 2016, 4:38 PMOur European allies are under siege from radical Islamic terrorism. The Paris attacks last November killed 130 people and seriously injured hundreds more. The Brussels attacks last week killed more than 30 people and struck at the heart of NATO. Americans were among the victims of both attacks as the terrorists do not differentiate between us and our close allies.One of the causes of this horror has been European bureaucrats restraining law enforcement from fully engaging with the Muslim community in “no go” zones. As a result, for years, a radical, theocratic, violent ideology has spread in some mosques and Muslim neighborhoods throughout Europe. Terrorists have exploited these isolated enclaves to recruit followers, formulate plots and orchestrate attacks.BRATTON RIPS CRUZ AGAIN OVER PROPOSALTO MONITOR MUSLIMSThere is no better example of these “no go” zones than one neighborhood in the city of this latest horrific attack — the municipality of Molenbeek in the city of Brussels. In attack after attack, from 9/11 to Madrid to Paris to Brussels, the trail seems to come back repeatedly to Molenbeek. At least three of the terrorists of the November 2015 Paris attack grew up and lived there. In fact, one of the key terrorists of the Paris attack, Salah Abdeslam, fled back to Molenbeek where he knew he could find sanctuary. It is telling that Abdeslam effectively hid in plain sight there for weeks in the same city as the headquarters of NATO and the European Union.Even Belgium’s own Prime Minister, Charles Michel, has admitted after the Paris attacks that “[A]lmost every time there’s a link with Molenbeek . . . It’s been a form of laissez faire and laxity. Now we’re paying the bill.”Many European leaders are now recognizing that passively allowing the Islamist threat to fester was a serious error. We cannot make the same mistakes in America.NYPD TERRORISM CHIEF: TED CRUZ 'CAMPAIGNING THROUGH FEAR' In the wake of the Brussels attacks, I called for vigorously guarding against the political correctness that has plagued Europe. I also called for empowering law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they follow the path of Molenbeek and become havens for radical Islamic terrorists.The response was predictable. Liberal politicians, including President Obama, Hillary Clinton and Mayor de Blasio, all loudly denounced my approach. Indeed, they seemed far more outraged at my calling for us to prevent radical Islamic terrorism then they were at the terrorists who attacked in Brussels. In high dudgeon, they insist we must remain willfully blind to the root causes of these attacks.The Islamic State “is not Islamic,” President Obama absurdly tells us.New York Daily News front pages on the presidential electionEveryone knows that’s nonsense. Of course, there are many peaceful Muslims in America, and hundreds of millions across the world, who can be our allies in this global battle. But we cannot fight and win without identifying and confronting the enemy. Islamism is a political and theocratic philosophy that commands its adherents to wage jihad, to murder or forcibly convert the infidels (by which they mean everyone else). Islamism is the enemy, and it must be defeated.To do so, we must take a risk-based approach that focuses resources on the enclaves and potential hotbeds of radicalization where terrorists are likely to thrive. Just as with law enforcement’s successful efforts against gangs or drug dealers or the Mafia, we need resources and informants and undercover officers placed where terrorists are likely to be. We need lawful surveillance operations. And we need far more engagement between law enforcement and members of Muslim communities who are committed to working to rid their neighborhoods of the scourge of terrorism.In the wake of 9/11, there was a broad consensus in favor of a common-sense domestic counterterrorism strategy. But over the last seven years, the focus on protecting the homeland has been lost. The Obama administration has even joined Islamist governments in sponsoring a UN resolution that would shred our First Amendment by threatening to make discussion of radical Islamism potentially illegal. And now we are seeing the erosion of our counterterrorism tools here at home, even while we know from successful attacks from Boston to San Bernardino that terrorists are still plotting to strike America.A prime case study is here in New York City. Under Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Commissioner Ray Kelly, the NYPD started a counterterrorism unit that tracked demographic trends in New York City to provide investigators with important information about where terrorists might congregate and recruit. That sophisticated analysis can be a critical part of counterterrorism efforts to prevent an attack before it occurs or disrupt burgeoning terror cells. That unit likely saved lives.For example, a former director of intelligence analysis for the NYPD, Mitchell Silber, explained that the unit identified the Islamic Books and Tapes bookstore in Brooklyn as a venue for radicalization, and “provided a predicate for an investigation that thwarted a 2004 plot against the Herald Square subway station.” Moreover, the Obama administration’s counterterrorism advisor and now CIA director, John Brennan, stated the administration knew about this unit and referred to its work as “exceptionally good.” Indeed, while running for mayor in 2013, even then-candidate Bill de Blasio said he believed the unit was legal and was created in good faith to protect New Yorkers.Once elected mayor, however, de Blasio shut down that counterterrorism unit. He was taking heat from liberal advocacy groups who caricatured the unit’s work as “spying on Muslims,” which it wasn’t. New Yorkers, including the Muslim community, are less safe as a result.After the Brussels attacks, I called out the de Blasio administration for its shortsighted capitulation to its liberal allies at the expense of the safety and security of the people of New York. In response, Commissioner Bill Bratton penned an op-ed attacking my policy in this newspaper. He did not say that the work of the unit was misguided or a failure. Instead, he alleged, remarkably, that the unit “was finished” with its work and “it wasn’t serving any useful purpose.”Bratton has a difficult job, and I am grateful for all he does to keep the people of New York safe. I also understand that politically, he has no choice but to implement the de Blasio-Obama liberal agenda. But his explanation for dismantling the unit makes no sense; it ignores the nature of the threat that we face from radical Islam.Simply put, demographic trends are not static. They are dynamic. They change over time. The pockets of New York City that are fertile grounds for terrorist recruitment today may not be fertile grounds next year, and places without a significant radical presence right now may become hotbeds of terrorist activity in the future. To say that the work of a vital intelligence unit “was finished” is not plausible. It is the excuse of an administration grasping for anything to justify what was obviously a surrender to political correctness.Hitting back(Alex Wong/Getty Images)Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Mayor Michael Bloomberg have both stated they believe the unit was lawful and effective, and should not have been shut down.The de Blasio administration is trying to avoid the ideological foundation of the war radical Islamic terrorists are waging against us. While Bratton admits that the jihadists are driven by ideology, he astonishingly maintains that our response should have “no ideological component whatsoever.”That’s ridiculous. If the terrorist threat is driven by radical Islamic ideology, then we must take account of that ideology in countering the threat: To “stop the terrorists before they strike,” we must understand what their motivation and goals are, where they might plot attacks and which targets they are inclined to strike. Their ideology tells us how they might peddle their radical Islamism in our cities and towns and helps us encourage our fellow Muslim citizens to choose a different path.The hollow argument that ideology has no role in counterterrorism leaves no doubt that politics is afoot here.I repeat my call for de Blasio to repudiate the dangerous confines of political correctness and reinstate this important unit as the first step towards a more proactive, hard-headed counterterrorism strategy on the home front.The bottom line is that to defeat radical Islam, we need to focus our counterterrorism resources where terrorists are likely to be. That’s not profiling or spying. It’s common sense.An investigation of Wall Street fraud wouldn’t focus on community banks in the outer boroughs. If we want to defeat radical Islam, we need to focus on areas that are at risk of being infiltrated by jihadists.The vast majority of Muslim Americans are law-abiding citizens. Indeed, patriotic American Muslims have provided critical assistance to our law-enforcement, intelligence and military officials to detect and disrupt jihadist plots. And we need their help in the war on terrorism.These are dangerous times. If I am elected President, every American will have a commander in chief fiercely committed to defeating radical Islamic terrorism. This is a battle we must win. If we don’t want to become Europe, we need to put aside the political correctness, focus our efforts on stopping radicalization and do what needs to be done to keep America safe.Cruz, U.S. senator from Texas, is running for the Republican nomination for President.Sign up for BREAKING NEWS Emails

COOPER: Now we've come to Flint because this is a city in crisis, a city where, as you probably know, the tap water is toxic. Public servants, public institutions not only failed to prevent the crisis, their decisions created this crisis. The state of Michigan, in an effort to save money, switched Flint's water source to a cheaper, but riskier alternative, the Flint River. Safeguards were ignored. That river water corroded residential pipes, and for nearly two years, lead leaked into the water used in people's homes. Now, for much of that time, the state downplayed the danger, even in the face of growing complaints and physical evidence. For 100 days, the federal government knew about it, and yet in all that time nobody told the people of Flint. They bathed in the water, they drank it, and so did their kids. Even today, lead is still present in some of the water. Tonight the Democratic candidates are here to answer questions about what they would do for Flint, as well as about other issues facing their country right now. Each candidate has one minute for an opening statement, Senator Sanders is first. We begin with him. Senator Sanders? SANDERS: Anderson, thank you very much. Over the last several weeks I had the opportunity to meet with a number of residents of Flint at a town meeting in Flint, and I have to tell you what I heard, and what I saw literally shattered me. And, it was beyond belief that children in Flint, Michigan in the United States of America in the year 2016 are being poisoned. That is clearly not what this country should be about. As Anderson indicated, there's a lot of blame to go around, and one of the points that I have made is that I believe the Governor of this state should understand that his dereliction of duty was irresponsible. He should resign. SANDERS: But more importantly, what is happening in Flint to a lesser degree is happening throughout this country. In recent years we have seen a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires, and increase in income and wealth inequality, and all over this country middle class families are struggling. Cities and towns are struggling, in order to provide basic services. Among many other things, we need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our water systems, our waste water plants, our roads and our bridges. The wealthiest country in the history of the world has got to get its priorities right, take care of the people, no more tax breaks for billionaires. COOPER: Thank you, Senator. COOPER: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, I'll start by saying amen to that. We are here in Flint, I'm very grateful that my request that we hold this debate be held here so we can continue to shine a very bright spotlight on what has happened in this city. I agree, the Governor should resign, or be recalled... CLINTON: ... support the efforts of citizens attempting to achieve that. But, that is not enough. We have to focus on what must be done to help the people of Flint. I support a hundred percent the efforts by your senators and members of congress to get the money from the federal government in order to begin the work that must occur to fix the infrastructure. The state should also be sending money immediately to help this city. CLINTON: I know the state of Michigan has a rainy day fund for emergencies, what is more important than the health and wellbeing of the people, particularly children? It is raining lead in Flint, and the state is derelict in not coming forward with the money that is required. COOPER: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: And, we'll get to what we need to do to help the children and the people when I have a little more time because that's just as important as fixing the pipes. COOPER: We're going to have a lot of time for that. We want to begin tonight with the people of Flint themselves. This is Mikki Wade, she's a public housing program manager, and the mother of two kids. She says she's currently undecided, and has a question that both of you will be able to weigh in on. Ms. Wade? QUESTION: The water has impacted our lives in such a way that living comfortably in our home isn't the same anymore. The constant drives to pick up water just so my children can wash their hair, to wash our fruits and vegetables, and to brush our teeth is incredibly difficult. Once the pipes are replaced, I'm not so sure I would be comfortable ever drinking the water. QUESTION: If elected president, what course will you take to regain my trust in the government? COOPER: Secretary Clinton, we'll begin with you. CLINTON: Well Nikki, it's a very fair question. Your government at all levels have let you and your children and the people of Flint down. So I think that there are there several things. All the repair work that is being done -- and Mayor Weaver program that we support to begin to help train people in Flint to be able to do this work to distribute the water. Everything that is done has to be triple checked to regain your trust and to hold those who are responsible for fixing the pipes and delivering the clean water which has you said, you bathe in it and drink it and wash food in it. You do everything with it. Every one of us should have to run through in our minds how we use water every single day to understand the pressures and the real pain that families are going through. So I will make sure as President that I double and triple check. I will work with elected officials who I trust like your mayor and like your senators and member of Congress so that we can assure you that when it's fixed, you can trust it. You deserve nothing less. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, let me follow-up with that, he people here still wasn't drink the water in their homes as you well know. They can't bathe their kids in the water and they are desperate for accountability and specifics. As president can you give a specific about what you can do if you were president that would make Ms. Wade's life better and life better for people here? CLINTON: Well, I support what President Obama is doing. He called for and got accountability from the officials at the EPA to make sure the state is doing its job. He expanded Medicaid for helping kids particularly to get the health care they need. He is also ordered that there be a Head Start program. I support that. When it comes to the water itself, we are supporting a program that Mayor Waver announced through Flint Waterworks to pay people in Flint, not outsiders, but people here to deliver the water while we are fixing the pipes. I would do even more of that. As president, what we were able to put together was a beginning. As president, I would concentrate resources on the city for economic development for more jobs as we fix the water and provide the health and education, interventions that children need. COOPER: Senator Sanders for Ms. Wade specifically? SANDERS: What is going is a disgrace beyond belief. As the president of the United States, this is what I would do is if local government does not have the resources -- if state government for whatever reason America shouldn't be poisoned, federal government comes in, federal government acts. What is absolute incredible to me is that water rates have soared in Flint. You are paying three times more for poison water than I am paying in Burlington, Vermont for clean water. First thing is you say, people are not paying a water bill for poison and that is retroactive. Second of all, to ease anxiety, CDC has to come in and examine every child and adult in this community in terms of the amount of lead they may have. Thirdly, the wealthiest country has to rebuild the crumbling infrastructure, our water systems. I have a bill for a trillion dollars, it creates 13 million jobs rebuilding flint, Michigan and communities all over the country. COOPER: Thank you, senator. We will have more on the infrastructure shortly but I want to follow up with you. This crisis in flint as you know, as everybody in the room knows was created by the government. Your policies are about expanding government. Why should people from flint trust that more government is the answer? SANDERS: That's a good point, Anderson. Listen, I suppose they can trust the corporations who have destroyed Flint by a disastrous trade policy which have allowed them to shut down plants in flint and move to China or Mexico. We could trust them I'm sure. SANDERS: Or maybe -- you know, maybe, Anderson, tell you what -- we should -- maybe we should let Wall Street come in and run the city of Flint... ... because we know their honesty and integrity has done so much for the American people. Look, we live in a democracy, and I'm not in (ph) the last person to deny that government is failing in many respects. But at the end of the day, I will trust the people to create a government that works for them, rather than Wall Street or corporate America. COOPER: Secretary Clinton -- Secretary Clinton, you -- you've now both called for the governor to resign. I believe that's -- that's new for you. Previously, you had not called for that, but you're calling for that tonight. It's easy to blame the Republican governor, Rick Snyder. But the federal government also dropped the ball here. According to Section 1414 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA has to step in and take action when a state is informed at (ph) -- about water problems and doesn't do anything for 30 days, as the state here didn't do. The EPA knew for months and months, never warned the people of Flint not to drink the water. As president, would you fire the head of the EPA? CLINTON: Well, I think that the people here in the region, who knew about this and failed to follow what you just said, rightly, the law required, have been eliminated from the EPA. COOPER: So far, one person has resigned. CLINTON: I don't -- well, I don't know how high it goes. I would certainly be launching an investigation. I think there is one. I was told that -- you know, some of the higher-ups were pushing to get changes that were not happening. So I would have a full investigation, determine who knew what, when. And yes, people should be fired. How far up it went, I don't know. But as far as it goes, they should be relieved, because they failed this city. But let me just add this, Anderson. This is not the only place where this kind of action is needed. We have a lot of communities right now in our country where the level of toxins in the water, including lead, are way above what anybody should tolerate. We have a higher rate of tested lead in people in Cleveland than in Flint. So I'm not satisfied with just doing everything we must do for Flint. I want to tackle this problem across the board. And if people know about it and they're not acting, and they're in the government at any level, they should be forced to resign. COOPER: Senator Sanders, would a President Sanders fire the head of the EPA? SANDERS: President Sanders would fire anybody who knew about what was happening and did not act appropriately. And President Sanders would make the point that, how does it happen, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world? What are our priorities when, among others, Republicans today are fighting for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthiest people? How did we have so much money available to go to war in Iraq and spend trillions of dollars... ... but somehow not have enough money -- not just for Flint, the secretary is right. There are communities all over this country -- it's not just infrastructure, it is education. Detroit's public school system is collapsing. COOPER: Thank you -- thank you, Senator. SANDERS: Anderson, the bottom line is, and what my campaign is, is changing our national priorities. We need a government that works for all of us... COOPER: Thank you, Senator. SANDERS: ... not just wealthy campaign contributors. COOPER: I want to go to Lee-Anne Walters. This is Lee-Anne Walters. She was one of the first people to report problems with the water in Flint. One of her twin boys stopped growing. Her daughter lost her hair. She says she's undecided, and has a question for both of you to answer, but we'll start with Senator Sanders. Ms. Walters? QUESTION: After my family, the city of Flint and the children in D.C. were poisoned by lead, will you make a personal promise to me right now that, as president, in your first 100 days in office, you will make it a requirement that all public water systems must remove all lead service lines throughout the entire United States, and notification made to the -- the citizens that have said service lines. SANDERS: I will make a personal promise to you that the EPA and the EPA director that I appoint will make sure that every water system in the United States of America is tested, and that the people of those communities know the quality of the water that they are drinking, and that we are gonna have a plan to rebuild water systems in this country that are unsafe for drinking. COOPER: Let me just point out for accuracy's sake, there is 10 million lead service pipes delivering water to people all across this country tonight. Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, I agree completely. I want to go further though. I want us to have an absolute commitment to getting rid of lead wherever it is because it's not only in water systems, it's also in soil, and it's in lead paint that is found mostly in older homes. That's why 500,000 children today have lead -- lead in their bodies. So, I want to do exactly what you said. We will commit to a priority to change the water systems, and we will commit within five years to remove lead from everywhere. We were making progress on this in the 1990's. I worked with then Senator Obama to get more money, more support to do more to remove lead. CLINTON: That has, unfortunately, been in many ways, moved to a lower priority. I will elevate it, and I will do everything I can. Water, soil, and paint... COOPER: ... Thank you... CLINTON: ... We're going to get rid of it. COOPER: Thank you, Secretary. I want to go to my colleague, Don Lemon. LEMON: Anderson, thank you very much. Secretary Clinton, tonight you call for the resignation, or for Governor Snyder to be recalled. There are residents of this city who want to see criminal charges brought against those who are responsible. Do you think people should go to jail? CLINTON: Well, that's going to be up to the legal system, Don. I mean, I can't standing here -- I don't have all the facts, but people should be held accountable wherever that leads. If it leads to resignation, or recall if you're in political office. If it leads to civil penalties, if it leads to criminal responsibility. There has to be an absolute accountability, and I will support whatever the outcome of those investigations are. LEMON: Senator Sanders, do you think people should go to jail? SANDERS: Well, I agree, you know? We can't sit up here -- I can't sit up here and make judgment over whether or not somebody committed a criminal act. But, I will tell you this that after an investigation, if people, in fact, were found to have committed a criminal act -- I talked to a mother. Imagine this for a second, imagine a mother who had a bright seven-year-old gregarious girl doing well in school. Two years later, that child is now in special education, intellectual capabilities significantly deteriorated. That is a crime against that child, and the people of Flint. And, clearly, people are going to have to be held accountable. COOPER: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Secretary. I want to turn now to Bryn Mickle, the editor of the Flint Journal, he's our local partner in this debate. He has our next question. QUESTION: Secretary Clinton, it took this water crisis for politicians like yourself to notice we are a city in trouble. You've only both recently started talking about Flint, holding campaign events here in just the past few weeks. Secretary Clinton, you've even made the crisis a centerpiece of a new campaign ad. Why should the people of Flint believe that you aren't just using this crisis to secure political points? CLINTON: Well, I think because throughout my public career I have been evening the odds for people in every way that I could. I started out with the Children's Defense Fund, I worked throughout my time as a young lawyer as a person, an activist. Certainly, in Arkansas, then in the White House, to try to fix problems wherever I saw them. And, this problem is one that is particularly outrageous and painful at the same time. So, when I heard about it I immediately sent people here to find out what was going on. It was almost unbelievable. We have this problem in other places, but we don't say that it was actually caused by decisions made by public officials in positions of authority, as this one was. Then, when I talked to the mayor I basically said, ""What can I do to help?"" Then, when I came here, and I met with some of the mothers, and met their children, and heard their stories -- I'm just determined to do whatever I can. So, I have put together resources from the private and philanthropic communities to help provide a bridge because you've got to get the federal money, you've got to get the state money, but I'm going to do everything I can. And, I will be with Flint all the way through this crisis in whatever capacity I am. And, if I'm president, it will always be a priority for action from me. COOPER: Bryn has a follow up. QUESTION: Senator Sanders, how about you? Your first visit to Flint as a presidential candidate was just over a week ago. That's almost five months after the people here were told to stop drinking the water. What took you so long? SANDERS: Well, first of all, that's not quite accurate. I was here long before that. I will you what I did. What I did was meet very quietly in Detroit with parents and others who were impacted by this disaster. And the second thing I did is hold a town meeting, which was as nonpolitical as I could make it for hundreds of people to tell me and the world through the media exactly what was happening here in Flint. I think the fear and the legitimate fear of the people of Flint is that a certain point the TV cameras and CNN will disappear. And people are going to be left struggling in order to live in a safe and healthy community. All I can say is if you check my record going back a long time, I have stood with those who are hurting. I have stood with those who have no money, and I have taken on virtually every powerful special interest in the United States of America. That's my record and I'm proud of it. COOPER: Thank you, Senator. This city is also facing a jobs crisis, 75 percent of Flint's manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last 25 years and about the same amount of time, Michigan lost 230,000 manufacturing jobs. I want to go to Tanisha Motron, she grew up in flint and now works in Detroit at the Shinola watch factory which as you know, is often held up as the blueprint for how to save American industry jobs. She says she's leaning towards secretary Clinton and has a question for her. QUESTION: A lot of members work in the auto industry here in Flint. That's ultimately what I wanted to do when I got out of school unfortunately, I was unable to get any one of the big three and that's why I now reside at Shinola. If you are elected president, what are you going to do to in the United States instead of sending them overseas to other countries? COOPER: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: I'm going to do what I think will work which is both carrots and sticks. Let me talk about the carrots. We're going to have a very clear set of proposals and incentives for manufacturing so that we change the way that companies think about making investments again in America. I have a comprehensive manufacturing plan that I will be implementing. We're also going to invest more on infrastructure as we both have said, ""it's woefully under resourced."" That will put a lot of people to work. I want to do more to help small businesses, they are the source of two thirds of our jobs and we have to help them start and grow, particularly minority and women-owned small businesses. We need to do more to help create clean energy as a source of good jobs but I am also going to go after companies. You know, when a company decides to leave like Nabisco is leaving and they have gotten tax benefits from Chicago and Illinois to stay there, I will claw back the benefits. They will have to pay them back if they are leaving a place that actually invested in them. I am also going to go after companies like Johnson Controls in Wisconsin. They came and got part of the bailout because they were an auto parts supplier and now they want to move headquarters to Europe. They are going to have to pay an exit fee. We are going to stop this kind of job exporting and we are going to start importing and growing jobs again in our country. COOPER: Senator sanders, I will let you... SANDERS: I am very glad, Anderson, that secretary Clinton discovered religion on this issue but it's a little bit too late. Secretary Clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate America. NAFTA, supported by the Secretary cost, us 800,000 jobs nationwide, tens of thousands of jobs in the Midwest. Permanent normal trade relations with China cost us millions of jobs. Look, I was on a picket line in early 1990's against NFATA because you didn't need a PhD in economics to understand that American workers should not be forced to compete against people in Mexico making 25 cents an hour. SANDERS: And the reason that I was one of the first, not one of the last to be in opposition to the TPP is that American workers... ... should not be forced to compete against people in Vietnam today making a minimum wage of $0.65 an hour. Look, what we have got to do is tell corporate America that they cannot continue to shut down. We've lost 60,000 factories since 2001. They're going to start having to, if I'm president, invest in this country -- not in China, not in Mexico. COOPER: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well -- well, I'll tell you something else that Senator Sanders was against. He was against the auto bailout. In January of 2009, President-Elect Obama asked everybody in the Congress to vote for the bailout. The money was there, and had to be released in order to save the American auto industry and four million jobs, and to begin the restructuring. We had the best year that the auto industry has had in a long time. I voted to save the auto industry. He voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry. I think that is a pretty big difference. SANDERS: Well, I -- If you are talking about the Wall Street bailout, where some of your friends destroyed this economy... SANDERS: ... through -- excuse me, I'm talking. COOPER: Let him (ph) (inaudible). CLINTON: If you're gonna talk, tell the whole story, Senator Sanders. SANDERS: Let me tell my story. You tell yours. SANDERS: Your story is for -- voting for every disastrous trade agreement, and voting for corporate America. Did I vote against the Wall Street bailout? When billionaires on Wall Street destroyed this economy, they went to Congress and they said, ""please, we'll be good boys, bail us out."" You know what I said? I said, ""let the billionaires themselves bail out Wall Street."" It shouldn't be the middle class of this country. COOPER: Secretary Clinton? SANDERS: Wait a minute. Wait. Could I finish? You'll have your turn, all right? But ultimately, if you look at our records, I stood up to corporate America time and time again. I went to Mexico. I saw the lives of people who were working in American factories and making $0.25 an hour. I understood that these trade agreements were going to destroy the middle class of this country. I led the fight against us (sic). That is one of the major differences that we have. COOPER: Secretary Clinton. CLINTON: Well, if I -- if I could... ... to set the record straight, I voted against the only multinational trade agreement that came before me when I was in the Senate. It was called CAFTA. I came out against the TPP after it was finished. I thought it was reasonable to actually know what was in it before I opposed it. I oppose it. Now let me get back to what happened in January of 2009. The Bush administration negotiated the deal. Were there things in it that I didn't like? Would I have done it differently? Absolutely. But was the auto bailout money in it -- the $350 billion that was needed to begin the restructuring of the auto industry? Yes, it was. So when I talk about Senator Sanders being a one-issue candidate, I mean very clearly -- you have to make hard choices when you're in positions of responsibility. The two senators from Michigan stood on the floor and said, ""we have to get this money released."" I went with them, and I went with Barack Obama. You did not. If everybody had voted the way he did, I believe the auto industry would have collapsed, taking four million jobs with it. COOPER: Senator Sanders? SANDERS: I believe that the recklessness, the greed, and the illegal behavior of Wall Street drove this country into the worst economic downturn in the history of the United -- modern history of the United States of America. And I will be damned if it was the working people of this country who had to bail out the crooks on Wall Street. And what I proposed -- and I had an amendment that was defeated -- it was defeated by a voice vote on the floor of the Senate -- that said to those people on the top who benefited from Wall Street greed -- I said, ""you pay for the bailout. Don't go to my constituents, who are struggling to make ends meet."" In terms of the auto bailout, of course that made sense. In terms of the stimulus package, of course that made sense, and I strongly supported President Obama's position on that. SANDERS: But let us be clear, one of the major issues Secretary Clinton says I'm a one-issue person, well, I guess so. My one issue is trying to rebuild a disappearing middle class. That's my one issue. COOPER: Senator Sanders... CLINTON: Well, all I can say is that given the terrible pressures that the auto industry was under and that the middle class of this state and Ohio and Indiana and Illinois and Wisconsin and Missouri and other places in the Midwest were facing, I think it was the right decision to heed what President-elect Obama asked us to do. He sent a letter, an authorized letter, asking us to support that to save the auto industry. Yes, were there things in it that you and I would not have necessarily wanted? That's true. But when it came down to it, you were either for saving the auto industry or you were against it. I voted to save the auto industry. And I am very glad that I did. SANDERS: Let me just say this, while we are on Wall Street, one of us has a super PAC. One of us has raised $15 million from Wall Street for that super PAC. One of us has given speeches on Wall Street for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Now, I kind of think if you get paid a couple hundred thousand dollars for a speech, it must be a great speech. I think we should release it and let the American people see what that transcript was. CLINTON: And I have said and I will say again, I will be happy to release anything I have as long as everybody else does too, because what really is behind that question, Republicans and Democrats, is where I can stand up to Wall Street. Well, let's have some facts instead of some rhetoric for a change. I went to Wall Street when I was a United States senator. I told them they were wrecking the economy. I asked for a moratorium on foreclosures. I asked that we do more to try to prevent what I worried was going to happen. I also called for closing loopholes including the carried interest loophole. I also called for changes in CEO pay. I have a record. And you know what, if you were going to be in some way distrusted or dismissed about whether you can take on Wall Street if you ever took money, President Obama took more money from Wall Street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had. And when it came time to stand up to Wall Street, he passed and signed the toughest regulation since the Great Depression with the Dodd-Frank regulations. COOPER: Senator Sanders, just yesterday, in fact, you said just -- I believe it was yesterday you said not only her speech must have been a fantastic speech, it must have been a Shakespearean speech for that amount of money. Is her answer enough for you that she will release it when all the Republicans and Democrats do? SANDERS: All right, look, Secretary Clinton wants everybody else to release it, well, I'm your Democratic opponent, I release it, here it is. There ain't nothing. I don't give speeches to Wall Street for hundreds of thousands of dollars, you got it. Second of all, when we talk about being tough on Wall Street, and this galls me and the American people. Recently Goldman Sachs, among many other major financial institutions on Wall Street, as you know, reached a settlement with the federal government for $5 billion because they were selling worthless packages of subprime mortgages, $5 billion settlement. You know how many people, executives on Wall Street have gone to jail? If you are a kid caught with marijuana in Michigan, you get a police record. If you are an executive on Wall Street that destroys the American economy, you pay a $5 billion fine, no police record. If I am elected president, we are going to bring justice back to a broken criminal justice system. COOPER: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, I think we are in vigorous agreement on this. I have said repeatedly no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail. And I have said that I would use the tools in the Dodd-Frank regulations, that if any bank posed a systemic risk to the economy, they would be broken up. Because we now have tools, laws that we didn't have before. And I am very happy we did. Because there does need to be accountability, including criminal accountability if it is called for. COOPER: Senator Sanders, I just want to show the audience, you sent a tweet, I want to return to trade. You sent a tweet on Thursday, this is the tweet, I'm showing it to viewers. It says the people of Detroit know the real costs of Hillary Clinton's free trade policies. It shows pictures of crumbling buildings. It seems like you're blaming her for the situation in Detroit. SANDERS: Well, I'm blaming the trade policies. You know what? This is an amazing thing which I didn't know until recently, and I wonder how many people did know this. COOPER: But, you're calling them Hillary Clinton's failed trade policies. SANDERS: Well, Hillary Clinton, and everybody else who supported these disastrous trade policies. She wasn't alone. We have many, many Republicans and far too many Democrats who supported these disastrous trade policies. SANDERS: ... Do you know that in 1960 Detroit Michigan was one of the wealthiest cities in America? Flint, Michigan was a prosperous city, but then what happened is corporate America said why do I want to pay somebody in Michigan a living wage when I can pay slave wages in Mexico or China? We're going to shut down, we're going to move abroad, we're going to bring those products back into this country. Those trade policies, as much as any other set of policies, has resulted in the shrinking of the American middle class. And, I'll tell you what else it did. It's not only job loss by the millions, it is the race to the bottom so that new jobs in manufacturing, in some cases today, pay 50 percent less than they did 20 years ago. How stupid is that trade policy? COOPER: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: You know, if we're going to argue about the 1990's instead of talking about the future, which I'd much prefer because I think every election is about the future, and you all deserve to know what we will do to help you have a brighter future -- but, if we are going to talk about the 1990's I think it's only fair to say that at the end of the 1990's, after two terms of my husband's presidency, the unemployment rate in Michigan was 4.4 percent. There had been a net increase of 54,000 manufacturing jobs. There had been a net increase of 653,000 jobs overall. And, one of the ways jobs were brought to, and grown here in Michigan was through something called the Export-Import Bank which helped a lot of businesses, particularly small businesses, be able to export around the world. Senator Sanders opposes that. I think we're in a race for exports. I think China, Germany, everybody else supports their businesses. Here in Michigan there's been $11 billion dollars in recent years used to support exports, primarily from small businesses. I favor that, he's opposed it. I want to do everything I can for us to compete and win in the global economy... COOPER: ... Senator Sanders... CLINTON: ... and that's what I will do as president... COOPER: ... I just want to explain to viewers what the Export- Import Bank is, in case everybody is not quite as wonkish as everybody on this stage here. The Export-Import Bank, it's a federal agency, it gives loans to companies that export American products. Senator Sanders, you do oppose it. The vast majority of the bank's customers are small businesses, 176 right here in Michigan. What do you say to small business owners.... SANDERS: ... I'll tell you what I say... COOPER: ... Who rely on the banks to make their company profitable... SANDERS: ... I'll tell you what I say. Do you know what the other name of the Export-Import Bank is? What it's called in Washington? It's called the bank of Boeing because Boeing itself gets 40 percent of the money discharged by the Export-Import Bank. Seventy-Five percent of the funds going from the federal government, the Export-Import Bank, goes to large, profitable corporations. Many of these corporations have shut down in America, and have gone abroad to exploit poor people. You know what? I don't think it's a great idea for the American taxpayer to have to subsidize through corporate welfare profitable corporations who downsize in the United States of America. SANDERS: ... Seventy-Five percent of that money goes to large profitable corporations. COOPER: Senator Sanders, you are the only member of the Democratic caucus to vote against it. You're agreeing with Senator Ted Cruz on this, why is he right and the Democrats wrong? SANDERS: Well, let me tell you, I don't want to break the bad news. SANDERS: Democrats are not always right. Democrats have often supported corporate welfare... SANDERS: Democrats have supported disastrous trade agreements, but on this issue I do not believe in corporate welfare, and in fact, secretary Clinton may know or not know, but as a member of the Financial Services Committee, I worked hard and successfully to make sure that at least 20 percent of the money went to small businesses which is where it should go and not to profitable corporations and downsizing in our country. COOPER: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: When I traveled around the world on you behalf as Secretary of State and went to 112 countries, one thing I saw everywhere was how European and Asian countries were supporting their companies back in their countries, to be able to make sales and contracts in a lot of the rest of the world. In fact, without the export-import bank, supporting businesses of all sizes -- I believe more jobs would be lost here at home and more jobs literally would be exported. Instead of exporting products, we would be exporting jobs. I just believe that Senator Sanders took that lonely position because most of us who saw the results -- I saw it as a senator from New York. Your Senators saw it here in Michigan. They can give you the names of 240 companies in Michigan that have been helped. There is a company in Levonia being helped, there are companies all over this state. I know, if we are going to compete and win in the global economy, we can't let every other country support their companies and we take a hands off approach. I will not agree with that. COOPER: I'm going to let you respond but I just want to push back on this. Senator Sanders is correct, the majority of the money does go Boeing, does go to companies like Caterpillar. Do they need this money? CLINTON: I will tell you what, Anderson, after I investigated it, I concluded they did and here's why. There two big plane manufacturers in the world, there's Airbus and Boeing. Airbus does everything it can to get contracts to sell planes everywhere in the world. We don't have as quite an aggressive outreach from our government. I did go in many places around the world to sell American products because the alternatives were usually European, Asian, primarily Chinese products. That to me was an unacceptable concession. So yes, Boeing and other big companies get support just like their competitors do from the companies that they are from in the countries that provide the support. SANDERS: Isn't it tragic that the large multinational corporations making billions of dollars a year, shutting down in America, going to China, going to Mexico? Absolutely they need a handout from the American middle class -- I don't think so. Second of all, secretary Clinton traveled the world, she has been to Europe. And let's talk about Europe versus the United States. I'm sure that when you were in Europe, and France, and Germany and the U.K., and all of the other countries; you noticed something and that is every one of those countries guarantees health care to all of their people as a right. And I am sure you know as you know you do that in countries like the U.K. compared to America, we are spending almost three times as much as they spend in the U.K. for health care for our people. We are spending 50 percent more than the French. When we talk about Europe and their pluses and minuses, one thing they have done well that we should emulate and that is guaranteed health care for all people for a better care for all. COOPER: Thank you, Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton, 30 seconds and we have to take a break. So 30 seconds if you can. CLINTON: We are on the path to doing that thanks to President Obama and the Affordable Care Act, we have 90 percent coverage. We are lacking 10 percent. We are going to stay on that and get to 100 percent universal coverage. COOPER: We have to take a break. We will continue this discussion. We have a lot more to talk about. We will take a short break. We have more of the Presidential Democratic Debate from Flint, Michigan when we come back. COOPER: And welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate, live here in Flint, Michigan. We want to continue the discussion now -- we're gonna turn to the subject of crime. As most of you know, two weeks ago, an Uber driver in Kalamazoo, which is two hours from where we are tonight, went on a shooting rampage, killing six people, injuring two people. One of the injured was a 14-year-old girl. Her name is Abigail Kopf. She was shot in the head, her heart stopped, she was on life support -- looked like she might -- might not make it. But amazingly, Abigail pulled through. Her father... ... her father Gene Kopf is here tonight. And I know, Gene, you have a question. But before you ask your question, I just want to ask, how is Abigail doing tonight? QUESTION: She is now laughing and giggling, but she has a long road of physical recovery. COOPER: I should point out you are leaning toward Senator Sanders, but I know you have a question that applies to both candidates. We'll first toss it to Secretary Clinton. What's your question? QUESTION: The United States has had a rash of mass shootings over the years -- 42 shootings in the United States this year alone. The man who shot everyone, including my daughter, in Kalamazoo, had no mental health issues recorded, and had a clear background. What do you plan to do to address this serious epidemic? I don't want to hear anything about tougher laws for mental health or criminal backgrounds, because that doesn't work. COOPER: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, first of all I am looking at your daughter and I'm very grateful that she is laughing and she is on a road to recovery. But it never should have happened. You know, on average, 90 people a day are killed by gun violence in our country. I think we have to try everything that works to try to limit the numbers of people and the kinds of people who are given access to firearms. The Brady Bill, which has been in effect now for about 23 years, has kept more than two million purchases from going forward. So we do have to continue to try to work on that because not every killer will have the same profile. But the comprehensive background checks, closing the gun show loophole, closing the online loophole, closing what's called the Charleston loophole, where you get a gun at the end of three days, even if the background check is not completed which is what the killer in Charleston did. And then they found out later, he shouldn't have gotten the gun when he killed nine people at Mother Emmanuel Church. I also believe, so strongly Gene (ph), that giving immunity to gunmakers and sellers was a terrible mistake. CLINTON: Because it removed any accountability from the makers and the sellers. And it also disrupted what was a very promising legal theory, to try to get makers to do more to make guns safer for example. To try to give sellers more accountability for selling guns when they shouldn't have. So that is an issue that Senator Sanders and I differ on, I voted against giving them immunity, but I think we should very seriously move to repeal that and go back to making sure gun makers and sellers are like any other business. They can be held accountable. And then I do think we have got to have a public... CLINTON: Well, we've got to have a public discussion, because we have created a culture in which people grab for guns all the time. COOPER: Thank you. CLINTON: And there has got to be a way to have more warning signals and more efforts to try to stop that from happening like with the man who shot your daughter. COOPER: I want to go to Senator Sanders. COOPER: Senator Sanders? SANDERS: I remember President Obama being on television maybe three months ago. Showed the secretary members as well. She knows the president, I know the president. And he is generally speaking in public and he's not a very emotional guy. And he -- after the mass killing in Oregon if my memory is correct, he said look. There -- to be honest with you, let's be honest. Nobody has a magic solution to this problem. Any lunatic tomorrow, any person can walk into a theater and do something horrific. And you know what? For us to tell you that that absolutely will not happen would be untrue. But what the president said, he said look, this is a tough issue. But we have got to do everything we possibly can to minimize the possibility of these mass killings. You are looking at a guy who comes from a rural state with no gun control. I have a D minus voting record from the NRA. You are looking at a guy who in 1988 lost a statewide election for Congress because I was the only candidate who said you know what, I don't think it's a great idea in this country to be selling military-style assault weapons which are designed to kill people. SANDERS: I lost that election by three votes. I agree with what the secretary said. We need to expand and improve the instant background checks. Bottom line is people who should not have guns in America should not be able to buy guns in America. COOPER: Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton mentioned the so- called Charleston loophole. What she is calling the Charleston loophole. Is that something, if you were president, you would you work to extend that three day? SANDERS: Absolutely, I agree. Look, that bill had some sensible provisions in it. It had the banning of bullets that pierce policemen's armor. Is that a good thing? I think we would want to get rid of that. particular legislation had safety locks on guns so the kids do not pick them up and shoot them. That bill had bad things in it. What I have said... COOPER: So you would want a longer than three days waiting period? SANDERS: Absolutely. That was a very arbitrary decision. What that real debate was about, as you may or may not know, was about how long it would take for the instant background check to go into effect. I wanted that instant background check to go into effect as soon as possible. That was the most important part of that bill. COOPER: Secretary Clinton -- actually, Senator Sanders, let me continue to follow-up, because Secretary Clinton mentioned the liability. Right now, families of Sandy Hook victims announced that they are going to sue Remington, who made the AR-15 which was used in the Newtown massacre. Now, they believe -- those families believe that -- that Remington, the distributors, the sellers -- should be held legally responsible for how that gun -- how their product is used. Now, the lawsuit may not go anywhere because of the bill you voted for -- legislation that prevents gun makers from being sued. Tonight, what do you say to those families? SANDERS: Well, this is what I say, if I understand it -- and correct me if I'm wrong. If you go to a gun store and you legally purchase a gun, and then, three days later, if you go out and start killing people, is the point of this lawsuit to hold the gun shop owner or the manufacturer of that gun liable? If that is the point, I have to tell you I disagree. I disagree because you hold people -- in terms of this liability thing, where you hold manufacturers' liability is if they understand that they're selling guns into an area that -- it's getting into the hands of criminals, of course they should be held liable. But if they are selling a product to a person who buys it legally, what you're really talking about is ending gun manufacturing in America. I don't agree with that. COOPER: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, that -- that is not -- that is not what happened, and I think it's important for people to understand. Because of the proliferation of guns, because of the epidemic of gun violence in our country, there were a group of cities, states, and other concerned people who, in the late 90s and in the early 2000s, were working on legal theories that they thought would force gun makers to do more to make guns safer and force sellers to be much more responsible. The NRA saw this happening, and they said, ""we've got to stop it. Last thing in the world we want is to have guns that you can only shoot with your fingerprint, or to have guns with such strong safety locks on them that they may not be sellable."" So the NRA went to the Congress, and the head of the NRA has said this was the most important NRA legislation in more than 20 years... CLINTON: ... and they basically went to the Congress -- I was there. COOPER: ... Secretary... CLINTON: I was in the Senate. And they said, ""give us absolute immunity."" No other industry in America has absolute immunity... CLINTON: ...and they sell products all the time that cause harm... SANDERS: So let's say this. Let's say this. CLINTON: ... and they're held responsible. COOPER: Senator Sanders. SANDERS: If I understand -- and -- you know, as I understand it, what you're really talking about is not what Secretary Clinton is responding to. As I understand it -- and maybe I'm wrong on this, but what you were essentially saying, and what people are saying, is that, if somebody who is crazy or a criminal or a horrible person goes around shooting people, the manufacturer of that gun should be held liable. And if that is your position, then what you are saying, essentially -- if that is the case, as I understand it -- it's not what Secretary Clinton is talking about. I agree with what she said. But if that is the case, then essentially, your position is there should not be any guns in America, period. CLINTON: That is like the NRA position. No. SANDERS: Can I -- can I finish, please? All right? And you can -- there are people who hold that view. And that's fine, if you hold it. I think what you do is you hold those people who have used the gun accountable. You try to make... COOPER: We're gonna move on. SANDERS: ... guns as safe as possible, but I would disagree on that. COOPER: We're gonna move on. Dawn (ph)... CLINTON: Anderson, I just want to finish, because this -- I know some of the parents from Sandy Hook. I want people in this audience to think about what it must feel like to send off your first grader, little backpack, maybe, on his or her back, and then the next thing you hear is that somebody has come to that school using an automatic weapon, an AR-15, and murdered those children. Now, they are trying to prevent that from happening to any other family. CLINTON: And the best way to do that is to go right at the people... COOPER: Senator Sanders... CLINTON: ... you talk about corporate greed? CLINTON: The gun manufacturers sell guns to make as much money as they can make. COOPER: Senator Sanders. SANDERS: You know, I think it is a little bit -- it is a little bit -- look, what happened at Sandy Hook, what happened in Michigan, what has happened far too often all over this country is a terrible, terrible tragedy, and we have got to do everything we can, as I mentioned a moment ago, to end these mass killings. But, as I understand what your question is -- and, you're not the only person whose heart was broken. I know, I was there in the Senate when we learned about this killing. It is almost unspeakable to talk about some lunatic walking into a -- I mean; it is hard to even talk about it. We all feel that way. But it, as I understand it, Anderson, and maybe I'm wrong, what you're really talking about is people saying let's end gun manufacturing in America. That's the implications of that, and I don't agree with that. COOPER: We're going to move on. Don Lemon? LEMON: Alright, thank you very much, Anderson. As a black man in America, if I were born today I'd have a one in three chance of ending up in prison in my life. Secretary Clinton, on the campaign trail, you are calling for an end to the era of mass incarceration, but a lot of folks in the black community blame the 1994 Crime Bill, a bill you supported for locking up a generation of black men. Given what's happened since 1994, why should black people trust you to get it right this time? CLINTON: Well, Don't, let me say this, Senator Sanders voted for that bill, we both supported it. And, I think it's fair to say we did because back then there was an outcry over the rising crime rate, and people from all communities were asking that action be taken. Now, my husband said at the NAACP last summer that it solved some problems, but it created other problems, and I agree. And, one of those problems was, unfortunately, a move to expand the reasons why people would be incarcerated, not just at the federal level which is what this bill about, but in states and localities as well. And, that's why the very first speech that I gave in this campaign was about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration because I believe absolutely that too many families were broken up, too many communities were adversely affected. So, we've got to do a bunch of things. On the criminal justice side, look, we've got to have better policing. That means body cameras, that means ending profiling, that means doing everything we can to make sure there's respect between the community and the police. And, when it comes to incarceration... LEMON: But, Secretary... CLINTON: ... That means we have to limit mandatory minimums, we have to end disparities and treatment at last through (ph) incarceration... LEMON: The question is why should black people trust you this time to get it right? That's the question. CLINTON: Well, Senator Sanders voted for it as well. Are you going to ask him the same question? SANDERS: Probably will. LEMON: Do you think your support -- your husband has said that this bill was a mistake. Do you think it was a mistake? CLINTON: I just said that. He said at the NAACP that there were some aspects that worked well. The violence against women provisions have worked well, for example. But, other aspects of it were a mistake and I agree. That's why I'm focused, and have a very comprehensive approach toward fixing the criminal justice system, going after systemic racism that stalks the criminal justice system, ending private prisons, ending the incarceration of low-level offenders, and I am committed to doing that. LEMON: And, Senator Sanders, before you respond, I want to ask you this. Back in 1994, here's what you warned, we are dooming tens of millions of young people to a future of bitterness, mystery, hopelessness, drugs, crime, and violence, but you voted for the bill anyway. Was your vote a mistake? SANDERS: You know, as I think Secretary Clinton knows, as we all know, there are bills in congress that have bad stuff, there are bills in congress that have good stuff. Good stuff and bad stuff in the same bill. Now, if I have voted against that bill, Secretary Clinton would be here tonight and she'd say, ""Bernie Sanders voted against the ban on assault weapons. Bernie Sanders voted against the violence against women act."" Those were provisions in the bill, as the Secretary just indicated. So, in that bill there was some good provisions, I have been a fierce fighter against domestic violence ever since I was mayor in Burlington. Violence against women act has protected millions of women in this country, it was in that bill. The ban on assault weapons, that's what I have fought for my whole life. It was in that bill. Now, what you are reading though is I went to the floor, as I recall, and that's what I said. I tried to get the death penalty aspects in that bill out. Secretary Clinton have a disagreement. I was then, and I am now opposed to the death penalty. SANDERS: So, to answer your question, what you read was a congressman who was torn, who said there are good things in that bill, there are bad things overall. I voted for it. But where we are right now is having more than 2.2 million people in jail -- more than any other country on earth. This is a campaign promise, at the end of my first term, we will not have more people in jail than any other country. COOPER: Thank you very much. I want to go to David Mcghee. David Mcghee runs a youth development program director and he is undecided, but his question is for Senator Sanders. David? QUESTION: We live in a diverse nation. Opportunities to lead however to be frank, are often at the feet at older Caucasian men and women. SANDERS: You are not talking about me, are you? QUESTION: Men more so than women. However, what experiences do you have that have helped you deeply understand the mind sets and values of other cultures? SANDERS: Well, I think the best answer -- I don't know that I can give you a definitive answer here, but I will give you this answer. When I was a young man at the University of Chicago, I worked with fellow black and white students trying to desegregate the University of Chicago owned housing. Most candidates for president, don't put this on their resume, but I was arrested by the Chicago police for trying to desegregate the Chicago school system. In 1963, and an important day for me, I went to the march on Washington led by Dr. King for jobs and freedom. Dr. King has been an important inspiration for me. In this campaign, if you go to berniesanders.com and read our position on criminal justice, it is I believe the strongest position of any candidate. What it says among other things, 51 percent of African-American kids today are unemployed -- you know we're going to do? We're going to provide education and jobs for those kids, not jails or incarceration. LEMON: In a speech about policing, the FBI director borrowed a phrase from Avenue Q saying,"" everybody is a little racist."" So on a personal front, what racial blind spots do you have? CLINTON: Let me go answer Mr. Mcghee's question because I think it's a profound one. I think the most important that happened to me was a combination of my church and youth minister when I was a teenager, insisting that we go in to inner-city Chicago because I lived in a suburb and have exchanges with kids in black and hispanic churches. It was also important for me to be a baby-sitter for the children of migrant workers and to learn more about their lives, and to hear Dr. King speak in Chicago when I was about 14 years old. That got me thinking about what I needed to do to try to fulfill my faith. When I was in law school, I had the opportunity to mead a visionary woman, named Mary Right Adelman, who worked with Dr. King who was the first African-American woman who passed the Mississippi bar. I asked her for a job and she said she didn't have any money. I was working my way through law school and she said if I could get a job and get myself paid, she would give me a job. So I got law students a Civil Rights Research Council Grant. The first thing she did was send me to look at South Carolina, to investigate juveniles being sent to adult jails. The second thing she did was to send me to Alabama to investigate segregated academies. So from that moment until today, I am so grateful for my experiences as a very young woman driven by my church and my experiences working for the Children's Defense Fund which have given me some insight and have lit a fire inside me to do everything I can to address systemic racism. LEMON: I want to ask both of you this question. I appreciate you responding to that question, but I want to ask both of you again. In a speech about policing, the FBI director James Comey borrowed a phrase saying, ""everyone is a little bit racist."" What racial blind spot do you have? Secretary, you first. CLINTON: Well, Don, if I could, I think being a white person in the United States of America, I know that I have never had the experience that so many people, the people in this audience have had. And I think it's incumbent upon me and what I have been trying to talk about during this campaign is to urge white people to think about what it is like to have ""the talk"" with your kids, scared that your sons or daughters, even, could get in trouble for no good reason whatsoever like Sandra Bland and end up dead in a jail in Texas. CLINTON: And I have spent a lot of time with the mothers of African-American children who have lost them, Trayvon Martin's mother. And I've gotten to know them. I've listened to them. And it has been incredibly humbling because I can't pretend to have the experience that you have had and others have had. But I will do everything that I possibly can to not only do the best to understand and to empathize, but to tear down the barriers of systemic racism that are in the criminal justice system, in the employment system, in the education and health care system. That is what I will try to do to deal with what I know is the racism that still stalks our country. LEMON: Thank you, Secretary. Senator Sanders, on a personal front, what racial blind spots do you have? SANDERS: Well, let me just very briefly tell you a story. When I was in one of my first years in Congress, I went to a meeting downtown in Washington, D.C. And I went there with another congressman, an African-American congressman. And then we kind of separated during the meeting. And then I saw him out later on. And he was sitting there waiting and I said, well, let's go out and get a cab. How come you didn't go out and get a cab? He said, no, I don't get cabs in Washington, D.C. This was 20 years ago. Because he was humiliated by the fact that cabdrivers would go past him because he was black. I couldn't believe, you know, you just sit there and you say, this man did not take a cab 20 years ago in Washington, D.C. Tell you another story, I was with young people active in the Black Lives Matter movement. A young lady comes up to me and she says, you don't understand what police do in certain black communities. You don't understand the degree to which we are terrorized, and I'm not just talking about the horrible shootings that we have seen, which have got to end and we've got to hold police officers accountable, I'm just talking about every day activities where police officers are bullying people. So to answer your question, I would say, and I think it's similar to what the secretary said, when you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto. You don't know what it's like to be poor. You don't know what it's like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car. And I believe that as a nation in the year 2016, we must be firm in making it clear. We will end institutional racism and reform a broken criminal justice system. LEMON: Thank you, Senator Sanders. Senator Sanders, a CNN poll found that 64 percent of Americans felt like race relations got worse over the last decade. You have said they would absolutely be better under a Sanders presidency. So how would you be more effective in tackling racial issues than President Barack Obama? SANDERS: It's not a question of being better than President Obama, it is a question of building on the work that President Obama has done, the very important work. LEMON: You said ""absolutely,"" though, in an answer. SANDERS: No, well, he has given us a good, good basis and foundation. We have got to do better than that. And of course we should. But here's what I would do. I would end -- I would make sure that the Department of Justice investigated every killing of a citizen of this country when they are under apprehension from a police officer or when they are killed in police custody. I would end the militarization of local police departments. SANDERS: I would develop model programs to make police departments look like the communities that they serve. I would end minimal sentencing and give judges more discretion. I would recognize that substance abuse and drug addiction is a health issue, not a criminal issue. SANDERS: And I would make sure that those people who left jail had the education and job training so they don't go back into the same environment which got them in jail in the first place. LEMON: Senator, thank you very much. Secretary Clinton, in 1996, you used the term super predators to describe some young kids. Some feel like it was racial code. Was it and were you wrong to use that term? CLINTON: Well, I was speaking about drug cartels and criminal activity that was very concerning to folks across the country. I think it was a poor choice of words, I never used it before, I haven't used it since, I would not use it again. Because my whole life, to go back to what I was saying to Mr. Mcgee (ph), is, you know, really, ever since I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, is to try to figure out ways to even the odds for people that are left out and left behind. And I know very well that we have too many kids in our country right now who are living in poverty, who are going to schools like the ones in Detroit that have mold and rodents in them. I saw that in South Carolina. It's unfortunately across America. So what we have got to do is provide more opportunities earlier in the lives of every child. That's why I believe in supporting families, early childhood education, universal pre-kindergarten, help kids be successful. And here is Flint, we've got to do more to mitigate against the effects of lead, because too many kids are having the experiences I've been told about, where they're falling back in school, where they are having headaches because of the lead exposure. CLINTON: So we're going to have to do even more here than we would do in most other counties. LEMON: We're going to talk about education in just a moment. SANDERS: But can I respond to that briefly? SANDERS: Just in this. I am not sure which legislation that was. But I think it may have been the Welfare Reform, so-called... CLINTON: No, it was the crime bill. SANDERS: Oh, it was the crime bill. SANDERS: But during that same period, '96. There was a bill called -- so-called, it had a long title to it, Welfare Reform Bill. And this bill really was a bill that scapegoated the poorest people in this country. I strongly opposed that legislation. Secretary Clinton had a different position then. And what that legislation ended up doing is increasing extreme poverty, the poorest people in this country have become much poorer as a result of that -- really a bill that was written by Republicans. Bad bill. LEMON: Thank you. Secretary Clinton, you were in, so 30 seconds. CLINTON: Well, once again, if we're going to argue about the '90s, let's try to get the facts straight. That bill had a lot of provisions that unfortunately were stripped out by George W. Bush, by Republican governors. And I disagreed with the way it was applied. And I have a very clear set of ideas about what should be done to try to provide more support, including trying to cut poverty in half in the next years. But if we are going to talk about the '90s, let's talk about 23 million new jobs, incomes went up for everybody. The median African- American income went up 33 percent at the end of the '90s and we lifted more people out of poverty than at any other time in recent history. So we were on the right path. More jobs, rising incomes. LEMON: Senator Sanders. CLINTON: Along came George W. Bush and trickle down economics and brought us the Great Recession, which thank goodness President Obama has been digging us out of ever since. LEMON: Senator Sanders. SANDERS: Secretary Clinton is right. In the 1990s, we created a whole lot of jobs. Good. And I supported many of your husband's initiatives. But in the 1990s, you know what we also did? We deregulated Wall Street, which allowed Wall Street to end up destroying our economy. We passed NAFTA and other disastrous trade agreements which had a horrendous impact on African-Americans in particular, in Flint, in Detroit and all across this country. So when we talk about the '90s, you're right. A lot of good things happened, but a lot of bad things happened. LEMON: Thank you Senator. SANDERS: I voted against those trade agreements. LEMON: Thank you Senator. SANDERS: And I voted against Wall Street deregulation. COOPER: Thank you Senator. We have to take a short break. The Democratic presidential discussion and debate continues here from Flint in just a moment. COOPER: And welcome back. Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate, here live in Flint, Michigan. Let's -- let's move on to the subject of education. In nearby Detroit, the public schools have become a national symbol of neglect and failure. That school system is $3.5 billion in debt. Officials say they could run out of money by April. I want to bring in Shoniqua Kemp. She's right here -- Ms. Kemp. Her 14-year-old daughter Imani is a student in Detroit. Shoniqua is one of ten parents suing Detroit public schools -- not for money, she says, but to improve conditions. She says she's currently leaning towards Senator Sanders. Her question will go to both of you, but we'll start with Senator Sanders. Ms. Kemp? QUESTION: Thank you. Speaking of opportunities for success, in Detroit, schools open and close with no accountability to -- or transparency to the communities that it -- they service. Not only that -- in our schools, as you've stated, we have issues with rats, mold, no working water fountains, not to mention non- certified teachers, lack of accountability around transportation and special education, and so much more. QUESTION: With that said, our students can no longer suffer due to lack of these things, or having these dilapidated issues take place. So, my question is who's going to step up? Who's going to ensure that the policies procedures are put in place that will ensure, and bring forth a successful future for our students because my daughter cannot wait eight more years for success to take place at your hands. At the leader's hands. COOPER: Senator Sanders, let's start with you. SANDERS: Well, thank you very much for not being resigned to that horrendous situation, but being prepared to stand up and fight back... QUESTION: ... Thank you... SANDERS: ... That's what we need all over this country. And, let me be very honest with you, hard thing to say, but it is true. A great nation is judged not by how many millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how it treats the most vulnerable amongst us, and that is the children, and that is the elderly. And, do you know what? We should be ashamed of how we treat our kids and our senior citizens. SANDERS: We have a Republican leadership in congress now fighting for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the top two-tenths of one percent, but somehow we can't come up with the money to fix Detroit's crumbling public school system. Somehow we cannot make sure that Detroit has qualified, and good teachers. Somehow we can't make sure that there are summer programs for your children, and after school programs for your children. Somehow we cannot do what other countries around the world, is provide quality childcare and pre-K. We have got to change our national priorities, no more tax breaks for billionaires, and large corporations. We are going to invest in our children, and have the best public school system in the world. COOPER: Senator Sanders, before we go to Secretary Clinton -- Senator Sanders, let me just follow up with you. As president, you have to decide where to spend your political capital. There's a lot of things you want to do, where does fixing Mrs. Kim's daughter's school and other schools, where does that lay in your list of things to do... SANDERS: ... Anderson, not only do we have a crumbling school system in Detroit, and in many other areas, we have -- and everybody in this room should be embarrassed by this, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth. That is a disgrace. SANDERS: So, when you ask me about my priorities, my priorities are that no, we're not going to give tax breaks to the wealthy. We're going to ask them to start paying their fair share of taxes so we can raise the money to make sure that every child in this country, in Detroit, in Vermont, gets the quality education that he or she deserves. COOPER: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Mrs. Kim (ph), here is what I would do as president. Number one, I would reinstate a program we did have during the 1990's where the federal government provided funding to repair and modernize public schools because a lot of communities can't afford to do that on their own. CLINTON: Secondly, I would use every legal means at my disposal to try to force the Governor and the state to return the schools to the people of Detroit -- to end the emergency management... CLINTON: ... which, I believe, if you look at the data, the situation has only gotten worse with these emergency managers that have put the system further in debt. CLINTON: Number three, I want to set-up inside the Department of Education, for want of a better term, kind of an education SWAT team, if you will. Where we've got qualified people, teachers, principals, maybe folks who are retired, maybe folks who are active, but all of whom are willing to come and help. When Detroit gets back their schools, they should have all the help they can get to be able to get teachers in the classroom, to be able to find spaces while schools are being repaired. And, I also would look at how we could through the federal government support more teachers because we're going to have a teacher shortage in some of the hardest to teach districts... COOPER: ... CLINTON: ... including Detroit. COOPER: Let me just follow up with the Secretary and then I'll come back to you. Secretary Clinton, you've been endorsed by two of the biggest teachers' unions. There's an awful lot of great teachers in this country. It's an incredibly difficult job, one of the most difficult jobs there is but union rules often make it impossible fire bad teachers and that means disadvantaged kids are sometimes taught by the least qualified. Do you think unions protect bad teachers? CLINTON: You know, I am proud to have been endorsed by the AFT and the NEA, and I've had very good relationship with both unions, with their leadership. And we've really candid conversations because we are going to have to take a look at -- what do we need in the 21st century to really involve families, to help kids who have more problems than just academic problems? A lot of what has happened and honestly it really pains me, a lot of people have blaming and scape-goating teachers because they don't want to put the money into the schools system that deserve the support that comes from the government doing it's job. COOPER: So just to follow up, you don't believe unions protect bad teachers? CLINTON: You know what - I have told my friends at the top of both unions, we've got take a look at this because it is one of the most common criticisms. We need to eliminate the criticism. You know, teachers do so much good, they are often working under most difficult circumstances. So anything that could be changed, I want them to look at it. I will be a good partner to make sure that whatever I can do as president, I will do to support the teachers of our country. COOPER: Senator Sanders? SANDERS: What our campaign is about, is asking people to think big not small. And when we think big and we talk about education, we've got to ask ourselves a simple question, how is it -- starting at college that hundreds of thousands of bright young people are today, unable to go to college because they can't afford it? How is it that maybe your kid -- and when I was growing up, we didn't have any money -- we're not even dreaming about going to college because they knew it was another world. So starting with the top, now I know some people think it's a radical idea, I don't. I believe that every public college and university in this country should be tuition free. So that your child regardless of the income of your family knows that if she's studies hard, she is going to be able to go to college. And you know what else we do? We invest in child care. Right now, you've got child-care workers making McDonald's wages, that is crazy. COOPER: Thank you Senator. SANDERS: I want well trained, well paid, child care workers to give our youngest kids advance opportunities. COOPER: I want to go over to my colleague, Don Lemon. LEMON: Anderson, thank you very much. Secretary, I want to turn now from the state of our nation's school to the state of our nation's crumbling infrastructure, which you talked a little bit about in the beginning of this debate. But beyond the Detroit schools and Flint water crisis; pipes, roads, and bridges are in need of repair. It would take trillions of dollars to fix it all. Senator Sanders has proposed a one trillion dollar plan but yours is only a quarter of that, is your plan big enough to fix the crumbling infrastructure in this country? CLINTON: Well, there's no doubt, we have an enormous backlog of infrastructure repairs. Here's what I'd do - the congress finally got around to pass the Highway Transportation Bill, which should never have been partisan - it turned into be one partisan argument. I want to go further. I want to put 250 billion dollars additional, on top of what Congress has done. That gets us to a half a billion. I want to start a National Infrastructure Bank. I want to capitalize it with 25 billion that I believe will leverage 10 times that, that's another 250 billion. So I'm trying to do this in a way that will gain support and be affordable but there's no doubt, we have to do more on our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports. And as we've talked in the beginning here, under our ground, our water systems, our sewer systems. We have pipelines that are leaking and that are dangerous. We have so much work to be done and if we can put millions of peoples to work, I think my plan is a very good way to begin doing that work and get people out there doing it. LEMON: Thank you, Secretary. Senator Sanders, critics of the proposal say it's yet another example of a costly plan that will never get through Congress and can't be paid for. The best deal is what the Secretary just mentioned, the deal President Obama could negotiate with Republicans, is a $305 billion dollar highway bill. If he couldn't do more, how can you? SANDERS: Well, let's begin by discussing the problem. As you've indicated, the American Society of Civil Engineers say we need trillions of dollars -- trillions of dollars -- just to bring up our infrastructure to deal with -- water systems like Flint, just to bring them up to decent levels. We have suggested a trillion-dollar investment. Now, you know how we're gonna pay for that? I'll tell you how we're gonna pay for that. Right now, this country is losing $100 billion every single year because profitable corporations are stashing their profits in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and in other tax havens... ... and in some cases, not paying five cents in federal income tax. I will eliminate that outrageous loophole, and we will raise $1 trillion. And by the way, not only do we rebuild our crumbling infrastructure -- $1 trillion over five years creates 13 million decent-paying jobs. COOPER: Thank you -- thank you, Senator Sanders. The issue of climate change has been a major talking point for both of you. I wanted to bring in Sarah Bellaire, she's a student at the University of Michigan at Dearborn who says she's currently undecided. Ms. Bellaire has a question on fracking, which, for viewers, is a process of oil and gas drilling that's led to a significant increase in American energy production and jobs, but also raises serious environmental concerns. Sarah, your question is for Secretary Clinton, but you'll both be able to weigh in. Sarah? QUESTION: Fracking can lead to environmental pollution including, but not limited to, the contamination of water supply. Do you support fracking? COOPER: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: You know, I don't support it when any locality or any state is against it, number one. I don't support it when the release of methane or contamination of water is present. I don't support it -- number three -- unless we can require that anybody who fracks has to tell us exactly what chemicals they are using. So by the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place. And I think that's the best approach, because right now, there places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated. So first, we've got to regulate everything that is currently underway, and we have to have a system in place that prevents further fracking unless conditions like the ones that I just mentioned are met. COOPER: Senator Sanders, you... SANDERS: My answer -- my answer is a lot shorter. No, I do not support fracking. And by the way -- by the way, Anderson, I'm glad you raised the issue of climate change, because the media doesn't talk enough about what the scientists are telling us, and that is, if we don't get our act together... ... the planet that we're gonna leave our children may not be healthy and habitable. I have introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the Senate, which, among other things, calls for a tax on carbon, massive investments... ... in energy efficiency, wind, solar and other sustainable energy. SANDERS: This is a crisis we have got to deal with now. COOPER: Senator Sanders, though... ... to Secretary Clinton's point, there are a number of Democratic governors in many states who say that fracking can be done safely, and that it's helping their economies. Are they wrong? You know -- you know, one of the differences -- look, Secretary Clinton -- and I've said this before, and I admit it -- she has the support of all the governors -- Democratic -- all the Senators, all the Congressmen. I don't. I am not part of that establishment. I plead guilty. I happen to be a member of the Environmental Committee. I have talked to scientists all over the world. And what they are telling me -- if we don't get our act together, this planet could be 5 to 10 degrees warmer by the end of this century -- cataclysmic problems for this planet. This is a national crisis. And I talk to scientists who tell me that fracking is doing terrible things to water systems all over this country. We have gotta be bold now. We gotta transform our energy system to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. We've gotta do it yesterday. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, before we come to you... COOPER: Secretary Clinton's gonna be able to respond. But, Senator Sanders, you've been very tough lately. Last week, you said this about Secretary Clinton. Quote, ""just as I believe you can't take on Wall Street while taking their money, I don't believe you can take on climate change effectively while taking money from those who would profit off the destruction of the planet."" Are you suggesting that she's in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry? SANDERS: No, what I am suggesting is that we have a corrupt campaign finance system. And instead of standing up to that finance system... SANDERS: And instead of standing up to that finance system, Secretary Clinton has super PAC, which is raising huge amounts -- well, I hate to say the word ""huge,"" every time I say huge it... SANDERS: A lot of money from Wall Street and from the fossil fuel industry. I am doing it a different way. I have 5 million individual contributors who have gone to BernieSanders.com to make a $27 contribution. I don't take money from the fossil fuel industry. COOPER: Thank you, Senator. CLINTON: Well, first, let me say I think I have the most comprehensive plan to combat climate change. It sets some very big goals, a half billion more solar panels deployed by the end of my first term, if I'm so fortunate to be president. And enough clean energy to power every home by the end of my second term. What I am looking at is how we make the transition from where we are today to where are today to where we must be. I worked with President Obama during the four years I was secretary of state to begin to put pressure on China and India and other countries to join with us to have a global agreement which we finally got in Paris. So I am committed to and focused on how we make that transition. I've already said we are taking away the subsidies for oil and gas, but it is important that people understand that a president can't go ordering folks around. Our system doesn't permit that. I am going to set the goals. I will push everybody as hard as I can to achieve those goals. We will make progress on clean renewable energy and create millions of jobs through that. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Senator Sanders, on the -- on the campaign trail, Senator Sanders often refers to a fundraiser in January that was hosted by executives from a firm that has invested significantly in domestic fracking. Do you have any comment on that? CLINTON: I don't have any comment. I don't know that. I don't believe that there is any reason to be concerned about it. I admire what Senator Sanders has accomplished in his campaign. I have more than 850,000 donors, most of them give less than $100. I am very proud of that. And I just want to make one point. You know, we have our differences. And we get into vigorous debate about issues, but compare the substance of this debate with what you saw on the Republican stage last week. COOPER: Senator Sanders. SANDERS: Well, let me make a couple of responses. Let me pick up on the last point the secretary made. You know, we are, if elected president, going to invest a lot of money into mental health. And when you watch these Republican debates, you know why we need to invest in that. SANDERS: But here's the difference. Here is the difference. It's not a personal difference. We just do things differently. All right. I honestly -- look, we have a corrupt campaign finance system. And what Secretary Clinton is saying and what every candidate who receives from the fossil fuel industry or the drug companies or Wall Street say, not going to impact me. The question the American people have to ask is, why are these people putting millions of dollars into candidates if it's not going to make a difference? COOPER: Thank you, Senator. SANDERS: And that is why, by the way, that is why one of my top priorities, if elected president will be to overturn this outrageous Citizens United Supreme Court (INAUDIBLE). COOPER: Thank you very much, Senator. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, no, we have to go. CLINTON: And that is one of the many reasons we must all support President Obama's right to nominate a successor to Justice Scalia and demand that the Senate hold hearings and a vote on that successor because there are so many issues at stake. On the first day of my campaign, I said, we are going to reverse Citizens United. And if we can't get it done through the court, I will lead a constitutional amendment effort to reverse it that way. COOPER: More questions coming up. Much more of the Democratic presidential debate here in Flint right after this. COOPER: Welcome back to the CNN Democratic Presidential Debate. Thanks very much for joining us. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, I want to ask you about something you talked about this morning. You said this morning, about your emails, that you expect the investigation to be wrapped up soon. The Republican front-runner, Donald Trump says, he's going to talk about your emails every single day if he is the nominee and out on the campaign trail. Democrats want to know, your supporters want to know, if you're the nominee, how are you going to take him on? CLINTON: Well, let me start by saying that the last time I checked as of last night, Donald Trump had received 3.6 million votes, which is a good number. And there is only one candidate in either party who has more votes than him and that's me. CLINTON: And, I am building a broad, diverse coalition across our country. I'm very excited by the support we're receiving. I have said, and I'll repeat here, I think that Donald Trump's bigotry, his bullying, his bluster, are not going to wear (oh) well on the American people. So, I will look forward to engaging him because, you know, I don't think we need to make America great again. America didn't stop being great, we have to make it whole again. We have to knock down the barriers, we have to end the divisiveness, we have to unify the country. And, if I'm fortunate enough to be the nominee that's exactly what I will do. COOPER: Senator Sanders, I want to ask you basically the same question. He's called you a communist, how are you going to... SANDERS: ... That was one of the nice things that he said about me. SANDERS: I'll tell you something, this is my right arm. I'm prepared to give -- no, I shouldn't say that. I would love to run against Donald Trump, and I'll tell you why. For a start, but almost -- not all, but almost every poll has shown that Sanders versus Trump does a lot better than Clinton versus Trump. SANDERS: Right here in Michigan there was a poll done, I think yesterday, or today, had me beating Trump in Michigan by 22 points. SANDERS: Secretary Clinton beat him as well, but not by so much. And, that's true nationally, and in many other states. And, the other reason I think we can beat Trump is that our campaign is generating an enormous amount of excitement. Just in the last two days we have won the caucuses in Maine, we won that tonight with a very large turnout. SANDERS: We won Nebraska, we won Kansas, and Kansas was the biggest turnout in their caucus history. I think we are exciting working class people, young people who are prepared to stand up and demand that we have a government that represents all of us. SANDERS: And not just the few. COOPER: Thank you. I want to -- we have a question from Denise Ghattas, she grew up here in Flint, Michigan. She says she's undecided on a candidate, she's got a question for -- actually she's got two questions. The first one if for Senator Sanders, then she'll ask another question to Secretary Clinton. Denise? QUESTION: Thank you. Senator Sanders, do you believe that God is relevant, why or why not? SANDERS: Well, I think -- well, the answer is yes, and I think when we talk about God whether it is Christianity, or Judaism, or Islam, or Buddhism, what we are talking about is what all religions hold dear. And, that is to do unto others as you would like them to do unto you. I am here tonight, and I'm running for president. I'm a United States Senator from my great state of Vermont because I believe that, because I believe morally and ethically we do not have a right to turn our backs on children in Flint, Michigan who are being poisoned, or veterans who are sleeping out on the street. SANDERS: What I believe as the father of seven beautiful grandchildren, I want you to worry about my grandchildren, and I promise you I will worry about your family. We are in this together. COOPER: Senator Sanders, let me just follow up. Just this weekend there was an article I read in the Detroit News saying that you keep your Judaism in the background, and that's disappointing some Jewish leaders. Is that intentional? SANDERS: No. I am very proud to be Jewish, and being Jewish is so much of what I am. Look, my father's family was wiped out by Hitler in the Holocaust. I know about what crazy and radical, and extremist politics mean. I learned that lesson as a tiny, tiny child when my mother would take me shopping, and we would see people working in stores who had numbers on their arms because they were in Hitler's concentration camp. I am very proud of being Jewish, and that is an essential part of who I am as a human being. COOPER: Denise has a question for Secretary Clinton. QUESTION: Yes. Secretary Clinton, during our church services, we pray for the president of the United States, we pray for the armed forces, we pray for all civil authorities, three times during our liturgy. And we give thanks to them. We pray for our loved ones. We pray for our enemies. To whom and for whom do you pray? CLINTON: Well, I have been several times in your services and have joined in those prayers and have also been privileged to lead them in some settings. I pray very specifically for people whom I know by name. People who either have gone through or are experiencing difficult times, illness, divorce, death, disappointment, all of the life experiences that confront most of us. I pray for the will of God to be known that we can know it and to the best of our limited ability, try to follow it and fulfill it. I have said many times that, you know, I am a praying person, and if I haven't been during the time I was in the White House, I would have become one. Because it's very hard to imagine living under that kind of pressure without being able to fall back on prayer and on my faith. So I do pray for people in authority. I try to think about what they are going through, even when I disagree with them. Trying to find some common ground, some common understanding that perhaps can make me more empathetic. I don't always succeed. I will tell you that. So I pray on a pretty regular basis during the day, because I need that strength and I need that support. And especially when you are in the position that I'm in and that Senator Sanders is in, where you are asking people to vote for you, to give you the most important job, not only in our country, but I would argue in the world. I think humility is one of the most important attributes that you bring to both that seeking and then if you're fortunate enough, to that holding of office and that's what I will try to do. COOPER: Thank you, secretary. It's time for closing statements. You'll each have one minute for a closing statement. Senator Sanders, we begin with you. SANDERS: My father came to this country at the age of 17 without any money. Never made any money. We lived in a three and half room rent-controlled apartment. So I learned about economics, not just in college, but in living in a family that didn't have money that had to scrape by. We are here tonight in Flint, Michigan, because a horrendous tragedy is taking place. But it's not just in Flint, Michigan. We are have 29 million people who have no health insurance. We're the only major country on earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave. We have school systems around America that are collapsing. And yet we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. But most people don't know that because almost all of the new incoming wealth is going to the top one percent. I believe, and with all due respect to my good friend, Secretary Clinton, that it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. It is too late for a corrupt campaign finance system and super-PACs that raise enormous amounts of money from special interests. We need in this country a political revolution where ordinary people stand up and reclaim the government that men and women fought and died for. Thank you. COOPER: Thank you, senator. COOPER: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, I'm running for president to do my very best to knock down every barrier that stands in the way of America realizing its potential and every American having a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. We have a lot of work to do. We have economic barriers. That's why I've laid out plans for more good jobs with rising incomes. We have barriers that stand in the way of quality health care. That's why I will build on the Affordable Care Act. We have barriers to education. That's why I want to start early and provide debt-free tuition, and deal with student debt so it is no longer the burden that weighs down so many young Americans. And I do want to take on the barriers of systemic racism. I may not have experienced them, but I see the results every single day. So I'm asking for your support in the primary here in Michigan on Tuesday. I'm asking for it, and I will do whatever I can as the Democratic nominee to run a campaign you'll be proud of. I don't intend to get into the gutter with whoever they nominate, but instead to lift our sights, to set big goals, to make it clear that America's best days can be and are ahead of us. COOPER: I want to thank both the candidates. While we've been debating tonight, CNN has learned that a labor union fund has committed $25 million in low-interest loans to help replace lead- contaminated pipes. I want to thank the candidates, the Democratic National Committee... ... our hosts here at the Flint Cultural Center, and most of all, the people of Flint. Just two days from now, it's another Super Tuesday, when Michigan and three other states have primaries. We'll have all-day coverage."

Please let me know if you need any additional clarification. Carolyn Hodges, TFRW President: We sought information from many sources and immigration groups across the nation to find a high and low number. While working with the groups, there were widely varied estimates. Because the range of numbers is so broad, we hoped to use the broadest of numbers so that we could get down to the point of finding smart solutions, not just more disagreement. Here is an example of the difficulty in estimating the number: The “residual method” is widely used to estimate the undocumented population of the USA. With this method, the known number of legal immigrants to the United States is subtracted from the reported U.S. Census number of self-proclaimed foreign born people to obtain the total, unauthorized immigrant (residual) population.[2] This methodology is used by the US Department of Homeland Security,[3] the Pew Hispanic Center, the US Census Bureau and others. Since undocumented immigrants have many reasons for not answering the U.S. Census correctly and since there are no penalties for answering the U.S. Census incorrectly, a direct subtraction is a well-known source of undercount error and has to be corrected. All known users of this methodology correct the foreign born population (about 35–50 million) by 10–40% (3–12 million) to account for this undercount effect. Critics claim this correction is in error no matter which size correction is used. (Jeffery Passel, Unauthorized Migrants: Numbers and Characteristics , Pew Hispanic Center, June 2005; Michael Hoefer and Christopher Campbell, Estimates of the Unauthorized Immigrant Population Residing in the United States: May 2006 , US Department of Homeland Security, Office of Immigration Statistics, Policy Directorate, January 2005) From: <Selby>, ""Gardner (CMG-Austin)"" <wgselby@statesman.com>Date: Friday, January 25, 2013 3:08 PMTo: Laura SorrellThanks, Laura. Where did the group field the 9 million and 50 million figures?326 pmJan. 25, 2013The example provided below there is a large margin of error when figuring out the number using the residual data method. Because the number varies from each report you see when browsing for the figure, it was clear that there is no correct number. Even the government agencies (US Dept. Homeland Security and the Census Bureau) agree that the margin of error can range anywhere from 10%-40% more than what is actually published. Again, the point is to show that no one knows the actual number and that is why TFRW is offering a smart solution to the issue, instead of just continuing the disagreement.4 pmJan. 29, 2013The 50 million source TFRW used was Joan Neuhaus Schaan, who at the time of speaking with TFRW, was the Fellow for Homeland Security & Terrorism Programs at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.1151 amJan. 31, 2013The 50 million source TFRW used was Joan Neuhaus Schaan, who at the time of speaking with TFRW, was the Fellow for Homeland Security & Terrorism Programs at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.The 50 million source TFRW used was Joan Neuhaus Schaan, who at the time of speaking with TFRW, was the Fellow for Homeland Security & Terrorism Programs at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.1153 amThe point was to show you're using sources that people do not view as credible. Sorry about not providing the source for the 9 million. Thought you had already proven that number to be correct on your own. Here are some sources below: The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that there are 8 to 9 million ""undocumented workers,"" as they are often called, in the U.S., and each year the number goes up by about 500,000. Other estimates are much higher. …the official number put out by the U.S. Census of 9 million… Again, the point of the resolution was to not get bogged down with the numbers, but to prove a point that no one knows what the actual numbers are. The overall resolution is to show that the real discussion should be about the policy and overall reform — not specific numbers.From: <Selby>, ""Gardner (CMG-Austin)"" <wgselby@statesman.com>Date: Friday, February 1, 2013 12:12 PMTo: Laura Sorrell I rechecked with the census bureau. It has made no estimates. Let me know if you have a source for the 9 million figure? "

WALLACE: Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. WALLACE: Brett — Brett, I think you would call that a home field advantage. BAIER: It might be. It might be. We’ll see. (UNKNOWN): Is this in the rules? An objection’s coming. BAIER: It might be. The rules for tonight are simple. One minute for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups. And if a candidate runs over, you’ll hear this. We also have a big crowd here with us tonight in the home of the Cavaliers, as I mentioned. … we expect them to be enthusiastic, as you heard, we don’t want to take anything away from the valuable time for the candidate. So, we’re looking for somewhere between a reaction to a LeBron James dunk and the Cleveland Public Library across the street. Somewhere there, we’ll find a balance tonight. Without further ado, let’s begin. BAIER: Gentlemen, we know how much you love hand-raising questions. So we promise, this is the only one tonight: the only one. Is there anyone on stage, and can I see hands, who is unwilling tonight to pledge your support to the eventual nominee of the Republican party and pledge to not run an independent campaign against that person. Again, we’re looking for you to raise your hand now — raise your hand now if you won’t make that pledge tonight. Mr. Trump to be clear, you’re standing on a Republican primary debate stage. TRUMP: I fully understand. BAIER: The place where the RNC will give the nominee the nod. TRUMP: I fully understand. BAIER: And that experts say an independent run would almost certainly hand the race over to Democrats and likely another Clinton. You can’t say tonight that you can make that pledge? TRUMP: I cannot say. I have to respect the person that, if it’s not me, the person that wins, if I do win, and I’m leading by quite a bit, that’s what I want to do. I can totally make that pledge. If I’m the nominee, I will pledge I will not run as an independent. But — and I am discussing it with everybody, but I’m, you know, talking about a lot of leverage. We want to win, and we will win. But I want to win as the Republican. I want to run as the Republican nominee. PAUL: This is what’s wrong! PAUL: I mean, this is what’s wrong. PAUL: Hey, look, look! He’s already hedging his bet on the Clintons, OK? PAUL: …but I’d say that he’s already hedging his bets because he’s used to buying politicians. TRUMP: Well, I’ve given him plenty of money. BAIER: Just to be clear, you can’t make a — we’re gonna — we’re going to move on. You’re not gonna make the pledge tonight? TRUMP: I will not make the pledge at this time. KELLY: Gentlemen, our first round of questions is on the subject of electability in the general election, and we start tonight with you, Dr. Carson. You are a successful neurosurgeon, but you admit that you have had to study up on foreign policy, saying there’s a lot to learn. Your critics say that your inexperience shows. You’ve suggested that the Baltic States are not a part of NATO, just months ago you were unfamiliar with the major political parties and government in Israel, and domestically, you thought Alan Greenspan had been treasury secretary instead of federal reserve chair. Aren’t these basic mistakes, and don’t they raise legitimate questions about whether you are ready to be president? CARSON: Well, I could take issue with — with all of those things, but we don’t have time. But I will say, we have a debate here tonight, and we will have an opportunity to explore those areas, and I’m looking very much forward to demonstrating that, in fact, the thing that is probably most important is having a brain, and to be able to figure things out and learn things very rapidly. So, you know, experience comes from a large number of different arenas, and America became a great nation early on not because it was flooded with politicians, but because it was flooded with people who understood the value of personal responsibility, hard work, creativity, innovation, and that’s what will get us on the right track now, as well. Could you please address Governor Bush across the stage here, and explain to him why you, someone who has never held executive office, are better prepared to be president than he is, a man who you say did a great job running your state of Florida for eight years. RUBIO: Well, thank you for the question, Chris, and it’s great to be here tonight. Let me begin by saying this: I’m not new to the political process; I was making a contribution as the speaker of the third largest and most diverse state in the country well before I even got into the Senate. I would add to that that this election cannot be a resume competition. It’s important to be qualified, but if this election is a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton’s gonna be the next president, because she’s been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight. Here’s what this election better be about: This election better be about the future, not the past. It better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today, not simply the issues we once faced. This country is facing an economy that has been radically transformed. You know, the largest retailer in the country and the world today, Amazon, doesn’t even own a single store? And these changes have been disruptive. They have changed people’s lives. The jobs that once sustained our middle class, they either don’t pay enough or they are gone, and we need someone that understands that as our nominee. If I’m our nominee, how is Hillary Clinton gonna lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck? I was raised paycheck to paycheck. How is she — how is she gonna lecture me — how is she gonna lecture me about student loans? I owed over $100,000 just four years ago. If I’m our nominee, we will be the party of the future. BAIER: Governor Bush, you have insisted that you’re your own man. You say you have a life experience uniquely your own. Not your father’s, not your brother’s. So do you understand the real concern in this country about dynastic politics? BUSH: Absolutely, I do, and I’m gonna run hard, run with heart, and run to win. I’m gonna have to earn this. Maybe the barrier — the bar’s even higher for me. That’s fine. I’ve got a record in Florida. I’m proud of my dad, and I’m certainly proud of my brother. In Florida, they called me Jeb, because I earned it. I cut taxes every year, totaling $19 billion. We were — we had — we balanced every budget. We went from $1 billion of reserves to $9 billion of reserves. We were one of two states that went to AAA bond rating. BUSH: They keep — they called me Veto Corleone. Because I vetoed 2,500 separate line-items in the budget. I am my own man. I governed as a conservative, and I govern effectively. And the net effect was, during my eight years, 1.3 million jobs were created. We left the state better off because I applied conservative principles in a purple state the right way, and people rose up. KELLY: Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is you speak your mind and you don’t use a politician’s filter. However, that is not without its downsides, in particular, when it comes to women. TRUMP: Only Rosie O’Donnell. KELLY: No, it wasn’t. KELLY: For the record, it was well beyond Rosie O’Donnell. TRUMP: Yes, I’m sure it was. KELLY: Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about women’s looks. You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees. Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president, and how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who was likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the war on women? TRUMP: I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct. I’ve been challenged by so many people, and I don’t frankly have time for total political correctness. And to be honest with you, this country doesn’t have time either. This country is in big trouble. We don’t win anymore. We lose to China. We lose to Mexico both in trade and at the border. We lose to everybody. And frankly, what I say, and oftentimes it’s fun, it’s kidding. We have a good time. What I say is what I say. And honestly Megyn, if you don’t like it, I’m sorry. I’ve been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me. But I wouldn’t do that. But you know what, we — we need strength, we need energy, we need quickness and we need brain in this country to turn it around. That, I can tell you right now. WALLACE: Senator Cruz, your colleague, Senator Paul, right there next to you, said a few months ago he agrees with you on a number of issues, but he says you do nothing to grow the party. He says you feed red meat to the base, but you don’t reach out to minorities. You have a toxic relationship with GOP leaders in Congress. You even called the Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell a liar recently. How can you win in 2016 when you’re such a divisive figure? CRUZ: Chris, I believe the American people are looking for someone to speak the truth. If you’re looking for someone to go to Washington, to go along to get along, to get — to agree with the career politicians in both parties who get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests, then I ain’t your guy. …. that we have $18 trillion in debt. Because as conservatives, as Republicans, we keep winning elections. We got a Republican House, we’ve got a Republican Senate, and we don’t have leaders who honor their commitments. I will always tell the truth and do what I said I would do. BAIER: Governor Christie, you’re not exactly the darling of conservatives. You tout your record as a Republican governor in a blue state. On Facebook, the most people talking about you, not surprisingly, come from your state of New Jersey, and one of the top issues they are talking about is the economy. This — this may be why. Under your watch, New Jersey has undergone nine credit rating downgrades. The state’s 44th in private sector growth. You face an employee pension crisis and the Garden State has the third highest foreclosure rate in the country. So why should voters believe that your management of the country’s finances would be any different? CHRISTIE: If you think it’s bad now, you should’ve seen it when I got there. The fact is — the fact is, in the eight years before I became governor, taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times. In the eight years before I became governor, spending was increased 56 percent. And in the eight years before I become governor, taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times. In the eight years before I became Governor, spending was increased 56 percent, and in the eight years before I became governor, there was zero net private sector job growth in New Jersey. Zero. For eight years. So, what did we do? We came in, we balanced an $11 billion deficit on a $29 billion budget by cutting over 800 programs in the state budget. We brought the budget into balance with no tax increases. In fact, we vetoed five income tax increases during my time as governor. We cut business taxes $2.3 billion, and we cut regulation by one-third of what my predecessor put in place. And, what’s happened since? A hundred ninety-two thousand private sector jobs in the five and a half years I’ve been governor. We have a lot of work to do in New Jersey, but I am darn proud we’ve brought our state back. KELLY: Governor Walker, you’ve consistently said that you want to make abortion illegal even in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. You recently signed an abortion law in Wisconsin that does have an exception for the mother’s life, but you’re on the record as having objected to it. Would you really let a mother die rather than have an abortion, and with 83 percent of the American public in favor of a life exception, are you too out of the mainstream on this issue to win the general election? (APPLAUSE) WALKER: …in that I believe that that is an unborn child that’s in need of protection out there, and I’ve said many a time that that unborn child can be protected, and there are many other alternatives that can also protect the life of that mother. That’s been consistently proven. WALKER: …I’ve got a position that’s in line with everyday America. WALLACE: Governor Huckabee, like Governor Walker, you have staked out strong positions on social issues. You favor a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage. You favor a constitutional amendment banning abortions, except for the life of the mother. Millions of people in this country agree with you, but according to the polls, and again this an electability question, according to the polls, more people don’t, so how do you persuade enough Independents and Democrats to get elected in 2016? HUCKABEE: Chris, I disagree with the idea that the real issue is a constitutional amendment. That’s a long and difficult process. I’ve actually taken the position that’s bolder than that. A lot of people are talking about defunding planned parenthood, as if that’s a huge game changer. I think it’s time to do something even more bold. I think the next president ought to invoke the Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the constitution now that we clearly know that that baby inside the mother’s womb is a person at the moment of conception. The reason we know that it is is because of the DNA schedule that we now have clear scientific evidence on. And, this notion that we just continue to ignore the personhood of the individual is a violation of that unborn child’s Fifth and 14th Amendment rights for due process and equal protection under the law. It’s time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the supreme being, and we change the policy to be pro-life and protect children instead of rip up their body parts and sell them like they’re parts to a Buick. BAIER: Senator Paul, you recently blamed the rise of ISIS on Republican hawks. You later said that that statement, you could have said it better. Why are you so quick to blame your own party? PAUL: First of all, only ISIS is responsible for the terrorism. Only ISIS is responsible for the depravity. But, we do have to examine, how are we going to defeat ISIS? I’ve got a proposal. I’m the leading voice in America for not arming the allies of ISIS. PAUL: I’ve been fighting amidst a lot of opposition from both Hillary Clinton, as well as some Republicans who wanted to send arms to the allies of ISIS. ISIS rides around in a billion dollars worth of U.S. Humvees. It’s a disgrace. We’ve got to stop — we shouldn’t fund our enemies, for goodness sakes. PAUL: So, we didn’t create ISIS — ISIS created themselves, but we will stop them, and one of the ways we stop them is by not funding them, and not arming them. KELLY: Governor Kasich, You chose to expand Medicaid in your state, unlike several other governors on this stage tonight, and it is already over budget by some estimates costing taxpayers an additional $1.4 billion in just the first 18 months. You defended your Medicaid expansion by invoking God, saying to skeptics that when they arrive in heaven, Saint Peter isn’t going to ask them how small they’ve kept government, but what they have done for the poor. Why should Republican voters, who generally want to shrink government, believe that you won’t use your Saint Peter rationale to expand every government program? KASICH: — first of all, Megyn, you should know that — that President Reagan expanded Medicaid three or four times. Secondly, I had an opportunity to bring resources back to Ohio to do what? To treat the mentally ill. Ten thousand of them sit in our prisons. KASICH: — to keep them in prison. I’d rather get them their medication so they could lead a decent life. Secondly, we are rehabbing the drug-addicted. Eighty percent of the people in our prisons have addictions or problems. We now treat them in the prisons, release them in the community and the recidivism rate is 10 percent and everybody across this country knows that the tsunami of drugs is — is threatening their very families. So we’re treating them and getting them on their feet. And, finally, the working poor, instead of them having come into the emergency rooms where it costs more, where they’re sicker and we end up paying, we brought a program in here to make sure that people could get on their feet. And do you know what? Everybody has a right to their God-given purpose. And finally, our Medicaid is growing at one of the lowest rates in the country. And, finally, we went from $8 billion in the hole to $2 billion in the black. KASICH: — and we’ve grown 350,000 jobs. WALLACE: Gentlemen, we’re turning to a new subject that all of you have been talking about and some of you have been disagreeing about, and that is the issue of immigration. Governor Bush, you released a new plan this week on illegal immigration focusing on enforcement, which some suggest is your effort to show that you’re not soft on that issue. I want to ask you about a statement that you made last year about illegal immigrants. And here’s what you said. “They broke the law, but it’s not a felony, it’s an act of love. Do you stand by that statement and do you stand by your support for earned legal status? BUSH: I do. I believe that the great majority of people coming here illegally have no other option. They want to provide for their family. But we need to control our border. It’s not — it’s our responsibility to pick and choose who comes in. So I — I’ve written a book about this and yet this week, I did come up with a comprehensive strategy that — that really mirrored what we said in the book, which is that we need to deal with E-Verify, we need to deal with people that come with a legal visa and overstay. We need to be much more strategic on how we deal with border enforcement, border security. We need to eliminate the sanctuary cities in this country. BUSH: — that people are dying because of the fact that — that local governments are not following the federal law. There’s much to do. And I think rather than talking about this as a wedge issue, which Barack Obama has done now for six long years, the next president — and I hope to be that president — will fix this once and for all so that we can turn this into a driver for high sustained economic growth. BUSH: — for those that are here. Not — not amnesty, earned legal status, which means you pay a fine and do many things over an extended period of time. WALLACE: Thank you, sir. WALLACE: Mr. Trump, it has not escaped anybody’s notice that you say that the Mexican government, the Mexican government is sending criminals — rapists, drug dealers, across the border. I’d like you — you’re right next to him — tell us — talk to him directly and say how you respond to that and — and you have repeatedly said that you have evidence that the Mexican government is doing this, but you have evidence you have refused or declined to share. Why not use this first Republican presidential debate to share your proof with the American people? TRUMP: So, if it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t even be talking about illegal immigration, Chris. You wouldn’t even be talking about it. TRUMP: This was not a subject that was on anybody’s mind until I brought it up at my announcement. And I said, Mexico is sending. Except the reporters, because they’re a very dishonest lot, generally speaking, in the world of politics, they didn’t cover my statement the way I said it. The fact is, since then, many killings,murders, crime, drugs pouring across the border, are money going out and the drugs coming in. And I said we need to build a wall, and it has to be built quickly. And I don’t mind having a big beautiful door in that wall so that people can come into this country legally. But we need, Jeb, to build a wall, we need to keep illegals out. WALLACE: Mr. Trump, I’ll give you 30 seconds — I’ll give you 30 seconds to answer my question, which was, what evidence do you have, specific evidence that the Mexican government is sending criminals across the border? Thirty seconds. TRUMP: Border Patrol, I was at the border last week. Border Patrol, people that I deal with, that I talk to, they say this is what’s happening. Because our leaders are stupid. Our politicians are stupid. And the Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning. And they send the bad ones over because they don’t want to pay for them. They don’t want to take care of them. Why should they when the stupid leaders of the United States will do it for them? And that’s what is happening whether you like it or not. WALLACE: All right. Obviously there’s a lot more to talk about this. We’re going to have more questions for the candidates on illegal immigration, plus other key topics including your questions on Facebook. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What will be your plan on making immigration easier for those that want to do it legally? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What specific steps would you take to contain the growth of ISIS? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I’d like to know what the candidates are going to do so that I feel safe in my own country again. WALLACE: Welcome back to FOX News/Facebook Republican Debate Night. We’re going to continue the questions now on illegal immigration. We kind of ended with a cliffhanger there. So let’s continue the conversation. WALLACE: Governor Kasich, I know you don’t like to talk about Donald Trump. But I do want to ask you about the merit of what he just said. When you say that the American government is stupid, that the Mexican government is sending criminals, that we’re being bamboozled, is that an adequate response to the question of illegal immigration? KASICH: Chris, first of all, I was just saying to Chris Christie, they say we’re outspoken, we need to take lessons from Donald Trump if we’re really going to learn it. Here is the thing about Donald Trump. Donald Trump is hitting a nerve in this country. He is. He’s hitting a nerve. People are frustrated. They’re fed up. They don’t think the government is working for them. And for people who want to just tune him out, they’re making a mistake. Now, he’s got his solutions. Some of us have other solutions. You know, look, I balanced the federal budget as one of the chief architects when I was in Washington. Hasn’t been done since. I was a military reformer. I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole and a 350,000 job loss to a $2 billion surplus and a gain of 350,000 jobs. WALLACE: Respectfully, can we talk about illegal immigration? KASICH: But the point is that we all have solutions. Mr. Trump is touching a nerve because people want the wall to be built. They want to see an end to illegal immigration. They want to see it, and we all do. But we all have different ways of getting there. And you’re going to hear from all of us tonight about what our ideas are. WALLACE: All right, well, Senator Rubio, let me see if I can do better with you. Is it as simple as our leaders are stupid, their leaders are smart, and all of these illegals coming over are criminals? RUBIO: Let me set the record straight on a couple of things. The first is, the evidence is now clear that the majority of people coming across the border are not from Mexico. They’re coming from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras. Those countries are the source of the people that are now coming in its majority. I also believe we need a fence. The problem is if El Chapo builds a tunnel under the fence, we have to be able to deal with that too. And that’s why you need an e-verify system and you need an entry-exit tracking system and all sorts of other things to prevent illegal immigration. But I agree with what Governor Kasich just said. People are frustrated. This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration. There are a million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States, and people feel like we’re being taken advantage of. We feel like despite our generosity, we’re being taken advantage of. And let me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates. The people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States. And they’ve paid their fees, and they hired a lawyer, and they can’t get in. And they’re wondering, maybe they should come illegally. RUBIO: And so these are important issues, and we should address it. It’s a serious problem that needs to be addressed, and otherwise we’re going to keep talking about this for the next 30 years, like we have for the last 30 years. WALLACE: Governor Walker. WALLACE: Governor Walker, from 2002 until as recently as 2013, just two years ago, you supported comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship. Now you say that was a quick reaction to something you hadn’t really thought about, and that you’ve changed your mind. Other than politics, could you explain why in the last two years you’ve changed your position on a path to citizenship, and are there other past positions that we shouldn’t hold you to? WALKER: Chris, I actually said that on your show earlier this year. WALKER: I acknowledged that. I said I actually listened to the American people. And I think people across America want a leader who’s actually going to listen to them. I talked to border state governors and other elected officials. I look at how this president, particularly through last November, messed up the immigration system in this country. Most importantly, I listened to the people of America. I believe we need to secure the border. I’ve been to the border with Governor Abbott in Texas and others, seeing the problems that they have there. There is international criminal organizations penetrating our southern based borders, and we need to do something about it. Secure the border, enforce the law, no amnesty, and go forward with the legal immigration system that gives priority to American working families and wages. (APPLAUSE) WALLACE: Senator Cruz, some 1,400 people submitted questions on this very hot topic of illegal immigration on Facebook, and a number of them were about the murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco, allegedly shot down by an illegal. Doug Bettencourt sent this question, “will you support Kate Steinle’s Law,” which would impose a mandatory five-year prison term for an illegal who is deported and then returns to this country? CRUZ: Chris, absolutely yes. CRUZ: — I have authored Kate’s law in the United States Senate and filed that legislation. I tried to get the Senate to vote to pass Kate’s law on the floor of the Senate just one week ago, and the leader of our own party blocked a vote on Kate’s law. You know, there was reference made to our leaders being stupid. It’s not a question of stupidity. It’s that they don’t want to enforce the immigration laws. That there are far too many in the Washington cartel that support amnesty. CRUZ: President Obama has talked about fundamentally transforming this country. There’s 7 billion people across the face of the globe, many of whom want to come to this country. If they come legally, great. But if they come illegally and they get amnesty, that is how we fundamentally change this country, and it really is striking. A majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty. I have never supported amnesty, and I led the fight against Chuck Schumer’s gang of eight amnesty legislation in the Senate. KELLY: Alright, gentlemen, we’re gonna switch topics now and talk a bit about terror and national security. Governor Christie. You’ve said that Senator Paul’s opposition to the NSA’s collection of phone records has made the United States weaker and more vulnerable, even going so far as to say that he should be called before Congress to answer for it if we should be hit by another terrorist attack. Do you really believe you can assign blame to Senator Paul just for opposing he bulk collection of people’s phone records in the event of a terrorist attack? CHRISTIE: Yes, I do. And I’ll tell you why: because I’m the only person on this stage who’s actually filed applications under the Patriot Act, who has gone before the federal — the Foreign Intelligence Service court, who has prosecuted and investigated and jailed terrorists in this country after September 11th. I was appointed U.S. attorney by President Bush on September 10th, 2001, and the world changed enormously the next day, and that happened in my state. This is not theoretical to me. I went to the funerals. We lost friends of ours in the Trade Center that day. My own wife was two blocks from the Trade Center that day, at her office, having gone through it that morning. When you actually have to be responsible for doing this, you can do it, and we did it, for seven years in my office, respecting civil liberties and protecting the homeland. And I will make no apologies, ever, for protecting the lives and the safety of the American people. We have to give more tools to our folks to be able to do that, not fewer, and then trust those people and oversee them to do it the right way. As president, that is exactly what I’ll do. PAUL: Megyn, may I respond? KELLY: Go ahead, sir. PAUL: I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from innocent Americans. The Fourth Amendment was what we fought the Revolution over! John Adams said it was the spark that led to our war for independence, and I’m proud of standing for the Bill of Rights, and I will continue to stand for the Bill of Rights. CHRISTIE: And — and, Megyn? Megyn, that’s a — that, you know, that’s a completely ridiculous answer. “I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from other people.” How are you supposed to know, Megyn? PAUL: Use the Fourth Amendment! PAUL: Use the Fourth Amendment! PAUL: Get a judge to sign the warrant! KELLY: Governor Christie, make your point. CHRISTIE: Listen, senator, you know, when you’re sitting in a subcommittee, just blowing hot air about this, you can say things like that. PAUL: See, here’s the problem. CHRISTIE: …is to make sure that you use the system (ph) the way it’s supposed to work. PAUL: Here’s the problem, governor. Here’s the problem, governor. You fundamentally misunderstand the Bill of Rights. Every time you did a case, you got a warrant from a judge. PAUL: …indiscriminately, of all Americans’ records, and that’s what I fought to end. I don’t trust President Obama with our records. I know you gave him a big hug, and if you want to give him a big hug again, go right ahead. KELLY: Go ahead, governor. CHRISTIE: And you know — you know, Senator Paul? Senator Paul, you know, the hugs that I remember are the hugs that I gave to the families who lost their people on September 11th. CHRISTIE: …and while still putting our country at risk. KELLY: Alright, we’ve gotta cut it off there. We have plenty more we want to get to. That was an interesting exchange, thank you for that. KELLY: Well, I want to move on, because I have — we’re gonna get to you, governor, but I — I really wanna get to a Facebook questioner. QUESTION: My question is, how would the candidates stop the treacherous actions of ISIS — ISIL and its growing influence in the U.S., if they were to become president? (END VIDEO CLIP) KELLY: Senator Cruz, I wanna talk to you about this, because many of the Facebook users and — and — the — the folks on Facebook wanted the candidates to speak to ISIS tonight. You asked the chairman of the joint chiefs a question: “What would it take to destroy ISIS in 90 days?” He told you “IISIS will only be truly destroyed once they are rejected by the populations in which they hide.” And then you accused him of pushing Medicaid for the Iraqis. How would you destroy ISIS in 90 days? CRUZ: Megyn, we need a commander in chief that speaks the truth. We will not defeat radical Islamic terrorism so long as we have a president unwilling to utter the words, “radical Islamic terrorism”. When I asked General Dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs, what would be required militarily to destroy ISIS, he said there is no military solution. We need to change the conditions on the ground so that young men are not in poverty and susceptible to radicalization. That, with all due respect, is nonsense. It’s the same answer the State Department gave that we need to give them jobs. What we need is a commander in chief that makes — clear, if you join ISIS, if you wage jihad on America, then you are signing your death warrant. KELLY: …an ideological problem — an ideological problem in addition to a military one? CRUZ: Megyn, of course it’s an ideological problem, that’s one of the reasons I introduce the Expatriate Terrorist Act in the Senate that said if any American travels to the Middle East and joining ISIS, that he or she forfeits their citizenship so they don’t use a passport to come back and wage jihad on Americans. CRUZ: Yes, it is ideological, and let me contrast President Obama, who at the prayer breakfast, essentially acted as an apologist. We need a president that shows the courage that Egypt’s President al-Sisi, a Muslim, when he called out the radical Islamic terrorists who are threatening the world. BUSH: …I remember, Megyn. KELLY: I remember it too, and ISIS, of course, is now thriving there. To the families of those who died in that war who say they liberated and deposed a ruthless dictator, how do you look at them now and say that your brothers war was a mistake? BUSH: Knowing what we know now, with faulty intelligence, and not having security be the first priority when — when we invaded, it was a mistake. I wouldn’t have gone in, however, for the people that did lose their lives, and the families that suffer because of it — I know this full well because as governor of the state of Florida, I called every one of them. Every one of them that I could find to tell them that I was praying for them, that I cared about them, and it was really hard to do. And, every one of them said that their child did not die in vain, or their wife, of their husband did not die in vain. So, why it was difficult for me to do it was based on that. Here’s the lesson that we should take from this, which relates to this whole subject, Barack Obama became president, and he abandoned Iraq. He left, and when he left Al Qaida was done for. ISIS was created because of the void that we left, and that void now exists as a caliphate the size of Indiana. To honor the people that died, we need to — we need to — stop the — Iran agreement, for sure, because the Iranian mullahs have their blood on their hands, and we need to take out ISIS with every tool at our disposal. KELLY: Governor Walker, in February you said that we needed to gain partners in the Arab world. Which Arab country not already in the U.S. led coalition has potential to be our greatest partner? WALKER: What about then (ph), we need to focus on the ones we have. You look at Egypt, probably the best relationship we’ve had in Israel, at least in my lifetime, incredibly important. You look at the Saudis — in fact, earlier this year, I met with Saudi leaders, and leaders from the United Arab Emirates, and I asked them what’s the greatest challenge in the world today? Set aside the Iran deal. They said it’s the disengagement of America. We are leading from behind under the Obama-Clinton doctrine — America’s a great country. We need to stand up and start leading again, and we need to have allies, not just in Israel, but throughout the Persian Gulf. KELLY: Dr. Carson, in one of his first acts as commander in chief, President Obama signed an executive order banning enhanced interrogation techniques in fighting terror. As president, would you bring back water boarding? CARSON: Well, thank you, Megyn, I wasn’t sure I was going to get to talk again. KELLY: We have a lot for you, don’t worry. KELLY: Fear not, you may rue that request. CARSON: Alright. You know, what we do in order to get the information that we need is our business, and I wouldn’t necessarily be broadcasting what we’re going to do. CARSON: We’ve gotten into this — this mindset of fighting politically correct wars. There is no such thing as a politically correct war. CARSON: The left, of course, will say Carson doesn’t believe in the Geneva Convention, Carson doesn’t believe in fighting stupid wars. And — and what we have to remember is we want to utilize the tremendous intellect that we have in the military to win wars. And I’ve talked to a lot of the generals, a lot of our advanced people. And believe me, if we gave them the mission, which is what the commander-in-chief does, they would be able to carry it out. CARSON: — extremely effectively. BAIER: Gentlemen, the next series of questions deals with ObamaCare and the role of the federal government. Mr. Trump, ObamaCare is one of the things you call a disaster. TRUMP: A complete disaster, yes. BAIER: Saying it needs to be repealed and replaced. BAIER: Now, 15 years ago, uncalled yourself a liberal on health care. You were for a single-payer system, a Canadian-style system. Why were you for that then and why aren’t you for it now? TRUMP: First of all, I’d like to just go back to one. In July of 2004, I came out strongly against the war with Iraq, because it was going to destabilize the Middle East. And I’m the only one on this stage that knew that and had the vision to say it. And that’s exactly what happened. TRUMP: And the Middle East became totally destabilized. So I just want to say. As far as single payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you’re talking about here. What I’d like to see is a private system without the artificial lines around every state. I have a big company with thousands and thousands of employees. And if I’m negotiating in New York or in New Jersey or in California, I have like one bidder. Nobody can bid. Because the insurance companies are making a fortune because they have control of the politicians, of course, with the exception of the politicians on this stage. But they have total control of the politicians. They’re making a fortune. TRUMP: — yourself great plans. And then we have to take care of the people that can’t take care of themselves. And I will do that through a different system. BAIER: Mr. Trump, hold up one second. PAUL: — for a decade. So I think you’re on the wrong side of this if you’re still arguing for a single-payer system. TRUMP: I’m not — I’m not are — I don’t think you heard me. You’re having a hard time tonight. BAIER: Mr. Trump, it’s not just your past support for single- payer health care. You’ve also supported a host of other liberal policies. Use — you’ve also donated to several Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton included, Nancy Pelosi. You explained away those donations saying you did that to get business-related favors. TRUMP: You’d better believe it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That’s true. TRUMP: If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I’ve given to, just so you understand, a lot of money. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not me. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not me. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But you’re welcome to give me (INAUDIBLE) Donald if you’d like. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: — he supported Charlie Crist. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: — this campaign, I hope you will give to me. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. TRUMP: Sounds good. Sounds good to me, Governor. I will tell you that our system is broken. I gave to many people, before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman. I give to everybody. When they call, I give. And do you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So what did you get? TRUMP: And that’s a broken system. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did you get from Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi? TRUMP: Well, I’ll tell you what, with Hillary Clinton, I said be at my wedding and she came to my wedding. She didn’t have a choice because I gave. I gave to a foundation that, frankly, that foundation is supposed to do good. I didn’t know her money would be used on private jets going all over the world. It was. We’re going to — we’re going to move on. BAIER: We’ll come back to you, Governor Walker. WALKER: Just one second on this, though. We — we spent a lot of time talking about Hillary Clinton and —and pitting us back and forth. Let’s be clear, we should be talking about Hillary Clinton on that last subject, because everywhere in the world that Hillary Clinton touched is more messed up today than before she and the president (INAUDIBLE). BAIER: We have many questions to come. BAIER: Many questions to come. BAIER: — broadly, the size of government is a big concern for Facebook users, Facebook persons, as well as, obviously, conservatives. But year after year, decade after decade, there are promises from Republicans to shrink government. But year after year, decade after decade, it doesn’t happen. In fact, it gets bigger, even under Republican politicians. So the question is, at this point, is the government simply too big for any one person, even a Republican, to shrink? HUCKABEE: It’s not too big to shrink. But the problem is we have a Wall Street-to-Washington access of power that has controlled the political climate. The donor class feeds the political class who does the dance that the donor class wants. And the result is federal government keeps getting bigger. Every person on this stage who has been a governor will tell that you the biggest fight they had was not the other party. Wasn’t even the legislature. It was the federal government, who continually put mandates on the states that we had to suck up and pay for. And the fact is there are a lot of things happening at the federal level that are absolutely beyond the jurisdiction of the Constitution. This is power that should be shifted back to the states, whether it’s the EPA, there is no role at the federal level for the Department of Education. HUCKABEE: And I’m still one who says that we can get rid of the Internal Revenue Service if we would pass the fair tax, which is a tax on consumption rather than a tax on people’s income, and move power back where the founders believed it should have been all along. BAIER: Dr. Carson, do you agree with that? CARSON: What I agree with is that we need a significantly changed taxation system. And the one that I’ve advocated is based on tithing, because I think God is a pretty fair guy. And he said, you know, if you give me a tithe, it doesn’t matter how much you make. If you’ve had a bumper crop, you don’t owe me triple tithes. And if you’ve had no crops at all, you don’t owe me no tithes. So there must be something inherently fair about that. And that’s why I’ve advocated a proportional tax system. You make $10 billion, you pay a billion. You make $10, you pay one. And everybody gets treated the same way. BAIER: Governor Bush? CARSON: And I have a lot more to say about it. BAIER: We’re going to come back to you, Dr. Carson. Governor Bush, you are one of the few people on the stage who advocates for Common Core education standards, reading and math. A lot of people on this stage vigorously oppose federal involvement in education. They say it should all be handled locally. President Obama’s secretary of education, Arnie Duncan, has said that most of the criticism of Common Core is due to a, quote, “fringe group of critics.” Do you think that’s accurate? BUSH: No, I don’t. And I don’t believe the federal government should be involved in the creation of standards directly or indirectly, the creation of curriculum or content. It is clearly a state responsibility. BUSH: … measured in an intellectually honest way, with abundant school choice, ending social promotion. And I know how to do this because as governor of the state of Florida I created the first statewide voucher program in the country, the second statewide voucher program, in the country and the third statewide voucher program in the country. And we had rising student achievement across the board, because high standards, robust accountability, ending social promotion in third grade, real school choice across the board, challenging the teachers union and beating them is the way to go. And Florida’s low income kids had the greatest gains inside the country. Our graduation rate improved by 50 percent. That’s what I’m for. BAIER: Senator Rubio, why is Governor Bush wrong on Common Core? RUBIO: Well, first off, I too believe in curriculum reform. It is critically important in the 21st Century. We do need curriculum reform. And it should happen at the state and local level. That is where educational policy belongs, because if a parent is unhappy with what their child is being taught in school, they can go to that local school board or their state legislature, or their governor and get it changed. Here’s the problem with Common Core. The Department of Education, like every federal agency, will never be satisfied. They will not stop with it being a suggestion. They will turn it into a mandate. In fact, what they will begin to say to local communities is, you will not get federal money unless do you things the way we want you to do it. And they will use Common Core or any other requirements that exists nationally to force it down the throats of our people in our states. BAIER: And do you agree with your old friend? BUSH: He is definitely my friend. And I think the states ought to create these standards. And if states want to opt out of Common Core, fine. Just make sure your standards are high. Because today in America, a third of our kids, after we spend more per student than any country in the world other than a couple rounding errors, to be honest with you, 30 percent are college- and/or career-ready. BUSH: If we are going to compete in this world we’re in today, there is no possible way we can do it with lowering expectations and dumbing down everything. Children are going to suffer and families’ hearts are going to be broken that their kids won’t be able to get a job in the 21st Century. BAIER: We have many more questions coming on a host of topics, here from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. Stay with us. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What would make stand out as the best choice for the Republican nomination? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do you intend to go about student loan reform? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What will be the first thing you will do to stimulate economic growth in our country and bring more jobs to the United States? BAIER: We have many more questions coming on a host of topics. Here from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. Stay with us. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What would make you stand out as the best choice for the Republican nomination? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do you intend to go about student loan reform? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What will be the first thing you will do to stimulate economic growth in our country and bring more jobs to the United States? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KELLY: It’s just before 10:00 p.m. on the East Coast. Welcome back to Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, and the very first Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential campaign. Ten candidates on the stage, selected based on their standing in five national polls. And tonight they are facing off, answering the questions you want asked. We hope. WALLACE: Gentlemen, we’re obviously digging into some subjects in depth, but we’re also going to change it up every once in a while throughout the next hour and have many rounds where we ask, you are not going to like it, only a couple of candidates questions on those subjects. This is the first of the many rounds, and it’s about somebody whose name probably hasn’t been mentioned enough so far tonight. Governor Kasich, let me start with you. WALLACE: Whoever the Republican nominee is, it looks at least for now like whoever that nominee is, he or she, will be facing off against Hillary Clinton. You know how she will come after whoever the Republican nominee is. She will say that you, whoever it is, support the rich while she supports the middle class. That you want to suppress the rights of women and minorities. She wants to move the country forward while you, the Republicans, want to take the country back to the past. How will you, if you’re the nominee, how will you answer that and take Hillary Clinton on? KASICH: Let’s start off with my father being a mailman. So I understand the concerns of all the folks across this country, some of whom having trouble, you know, making ends meet. But I think she will come in a narrow way. The nominee of this party, if they’re going to win, has got to come at it in a big way, which is pro-growth. Which is balancing budgets. You know, we were talking about it. People were saying, could we do it? I was the chairman of the Budget Committee and the lead architect the last time it happened in Washington, and when we did it we had great economic growth, we cut taxes, and we had a big surplus. Economic growth is the key. Economic growth is the key to everything. But once you have economic growth, it is important that we reach out to people who live in the shadows, the people who don’t seem to ever think that they get a fair deal. And that includes people in our minority community; that includes people who feel as though they don’t have a chance to move up. You know, America is a miracle country. And we have to restore the sense that the Amiracle (ph) will apply to you. Each and every one of the people in this country who’s watching tonight, lift everybody, unite everybody and build a stronger United States of America again. It will be and can be done. WALLACE: I know that all of you would like to answer this question, but we’re only going to ask one other candidate before we move on to a different subject, Dr. Carson. Basically, same question to you. If Hillary Clinton is the nominee and she comes at you with that kind of line of attack, how will you take Iraq? CARSON: If Hillary is the candidate, which I doubt, that would be a dream come true. But you know, the fact of the matter is, she is the epitome of the progressive — the secular progressive movement. And she counts on the fact that people are uninformed, the Alinsky Model, taking advantage of useful idiots. Well, I just happen to believe that people are not stupid. (APPLAUSE) And the way I will come at it is to educate people, help people to actually understand that it is that progressive movement that is causing them the problems. You know, you look at the — the national debt and how it’s being driven up. If I was trying to destroy this country, what I would do is find a way to drive wedges between all the people, drive the debt to an unsustainable level, and then step off the stage as a world leader and let our enemies increase while we decreased our capacity as a military person. And that’s what she’s doing. WALLACE: Gentlemen, we’re going to turn now to the subject of the economy, jobs and money and the government. And Governor Bush, I’m going to start with you. You have made a bold promise in your announcement. You have promised four percent economic growth and 19 million new jobs if you are fortunate enough to serve two terms as president. That many jobs, 19 million, would be triple what your father and your brother accomplished together. And four percent growth, the last president to average that was Lyndon Johnson during the height of the Vietnam War. So question, how on Earth specifically would you pull that off? BUSH: We’ve done it 27 times since World War II. I think we need to lift our spirits and have high, lofty expectations for this great country of ours. The new normal of two percent that the left is saying you can’t do anything about is so dangerous for our country. There’s 6 million people living in poverty today, more than when Barack Obama got elected. 6.5 million people are working part-time, most of whom want to work full-time. We’ve created rules and taxes on top of every aspiration of people, and the net result is we’re not growing fast, income is not growing. A four percent growth strategy means you fix a convoluted tax code. You get in and you change every aspect of regulations that are job killers. You get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something that doesn’t suppress wages and kill jobs. You embrace the energy revolution in our country. This president and Hillary Clinton, who can’t even say she’s for the X.L. pipeline even after she’s left? Give me a break. Of course we’re for it. We should be for these things to create high sustained economic growth. And frankly, fixing our immigration system and turning it into an economic driver is part of this as well. We can do this. WALLACE: Governor Walker. (APPLAUSE) Governor Walker, when you ran for governor of Wisconsin back in 2010, you promised that you would create 250,000 jobs in your first term, first four years. In fact, Wisconsin added barely half that and ranked 35th in the country in job growth. Now you’re running for president, and you’re promising an economic plan in which everyone will earn a piece of the American dream. Given your record in Wisconsin, why should voters believe you? WALKER: Well, the voters in Wisconsin elected me last year for the third time because they wanted someone who aimed high, not aimed low. Before I came in, the unemployment rate was over eight percent. It’s now down to 4.6 percent. We’ve more than made up for the jobs that were lost during the recession. And the rate in which people are working is almost five points higher than it is nationally. You know, people like Hillary Clinton think you grow the economy by growing Washington. One report last year showed that six of the top 10 wealthiest counties in America were in or around Washington, D.C.. I think most of us in America understand that people, not the government creates jobs. And one of the best things we can do is get the government out of the way, repeal Obamacare, put in — reign in all the out of control regulations, put in place and all of the above energy policy, give people the education, the skills that the need to succeed, and lower the tax rate and reform the tax code. That’s what I’ll do as president, just like I did in Wisconsin. WALLACE: Governor Christie, I want to engage you and Governor Huckabee in a subject that is a big issue in both of your campaigns, and that is entitlement reform. You say that you — to save the system that you want to raise the retirement age — have to raise the retirement age, and to cut benefits for Social Security and Medicare, and you say that some of the candidates here on the stage are lying. Governor Huckabee says he can save Social Security and Medicare without doing any of that. Is he lying? CHRISTIE: No, he’s not lying, he’s just wrong. I mean, so, there’s a difference — I’m the only guy on this stage who’s put out a detailed, 12 point plan on entitlement reform and here’s why — because 71% of federal spending right now is on entitlements, and debt service, 71%. And we have spent the last hour and five minutes talking about the other 29%, and no time on the 71%, and that makes no sense. Now, let me tell you exactly what we would do on Social Security. Yes, we’d raise the retirement age two years, and phase it in over 25 years, that means we’d raise it one month a year for 25 years when we’re all living longer, and living better lives. Secondly, we would needs (ph) test Social Security for those who are making over $200,000 dollars a year in retirement income, and have $4 to $5 million dollars in liquid assets saved. They don’t need that Social Security check. Social Security is meant to be — to make sure that no one who’s worked hard, and played by the rules, and paid into the system grows old in poverty in America. If we don’t deal with this problem, it will bankrupt our country, or lead to massive tax increases, neither one that we want in this country. WALLACE: Governor Huckabee? You say that changing entitlements, the kind of thing that Governor Christie is talking about, would be breaking a promise to the American people, and you say that you can keep those programs, save Social Security, save Medicare, without those kinds of reforms through a Fair (ph) tax, which is a broad tax on consumption. Please explain to Governor Christie how that would work, and how you could save these programs without the kind of painful reforms he says we need? HUCKABEE: Well, lets all be reminded, 60 million Americans are on Social Security, 60 million. A third of those people depend on 90% of their income from Social Security. Nobody in this country is on Social Security because they made the decision when they were starting work at 14 that they wanted to trust some of their money with the government. The government took it out of their check whether they wanted them to or not. And, if person goes to 65, they’re going to spend 51 years with the government reaching into their pocket at every paycheck. Now, here’s the point, whose fault is it that the system is screwed up? Is it the recipients, or is it the government? And, if Congress wants to mess with the retirement program, why don’t we let them start by changing their retirement program, and not have one, instead of talking about getting rid of Social Security and Medicare that was robbed $700 billion dollars to pay for Obamacare. It’s always that the government figures that they can do this off the backs of people, many of whom are poor, and depend on that money, and I just think it’s fundamentally lying to people and stealing from them, and we shouldn’t be doing it. WALLACE: …Thirty seconds. CHRISTIE: Yeah, sure. And, I don’t disagree with ending Congress’ retirement program. I’m a governor, I don’t have a retirement program in my state, and I don’t disagree with that. But, here’s the news to the American people, he’s complaining about the lying and stealing. The lying and stealing has already occurred. The trust fund is filled with IOU’s. We can’t fix the problem just by ending (ph) Congress’ retirement, that’s worth about, “this” much. We need to go at the fundamental problem, and the fundamental problem is that this system is broken. It has been stolen from. WALLACE: …Alright, this is it. Thirty Seconds, finally. HUCKABEE: Well, you ask about how we fund it. One of the reasons that Social Security is in so much trouble is that the only funding stream comes from people who get a wage. The people who get wages is declining dramatically. Most of the income in this country is made by people at the top who get dividends and — and capital gains. HUCKABEE: The fair (ph) transforms the process by which we fund Social Security and Medicare because the money paid in consumption is paid by everybody, including illegals, prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, all the people that are freeloading off the system now. That’s why it ought to be a transformed system. WALLACE: All right. Enough. KELLY: (OFF MIKE) Sounds like somebody’s a little R-rated. WALLACE: Mr. Trump, you talk a lot about how you are the person on this stage to grow the economy. I want to ask you about your business record. Trump corporations — Trump corporations, casinos and hotels, have declared bankruptcy four times over the last quarter-century. In 2011, you told Forbes Magazine this: “I’ve used the laws of the country to my advantage.” But at the same time, financial experts involved in those bankruptcies say that lenders to your companies lost billions of dollars. Question sir, with that record, why should we trust you to run the nation’s business? TRUMP: Because I have used the laws of this country just like the greatest people that you read about every day in business have used the laws of this country, the chapter laws, to do a great job for my company, for myself, for my employees, for my family, et cetera. I have never gone bankrupt, by the way. I have never. TRUMP: Excuse me. Excuse me. WALLACE: … that’s your line, but your companies have gone bankrupt. TRUMP: Excuse me, what am I saying? Out of hundreds of deals that I’ve done, hundreds, on four occasions I’ve taken advantage of the laws of this country, like other people. I’m not going to name their names because I’m not going to embarrass, but virtually every person that you read about on the front page of the business sections, they’ve used the law. The difference is, when somebody else uses those laws, nobody writes about it. When I use it, they say, “Trump, Trump, Trump.” The fact is, I built a net worth of more than $10 billion. I have a great, great company. I employ thousands of people. And I’m very proud of the job I did. Again Chris, hundreds and hundreds of deals. Four times, I’ve taken advantage of the laws. And frankly, so has everybody else in my position. … which is Trump Entertainment Resorts, which went bankrupt in 2009. In that case alone, lenders to your company lost over $1 billion and more than 1,100 people were laid off. WALLACE: Is that the way that you’d run the country? TRUMP: Let me just tell you about the lenders. First of all, these lenders aren’t babies. These are total killers. These are not the nice, sweet little people that you think, OK? You know, I mean you’re living in a world of the make-believe, Chris, you want to know the truth. And I had the good sense to leave Atlantic City, which by the way, Caesars just went bankrupt. Every company, Chris can tell you, every company virtually in Atlantic City went bankrupt. And let me just tell you. I had the good sense, and I’ve gotten a lot of credit in the financial pages, seven years ago I left Atlantic City before it totally cratered, and I made a lot of money in Atlantic City, and I’m very proud of it. I want to tell you that. Very, very proud of it. TRUMP: And by the way, this country right now owes $19 trillion. And they need somebody like me to straighten out that mess. WALLACE: Senator Rubio. Senator Rubio, more than 3,000 people sent us questions about the economy and jobs on Facebook. And here is a video question from Tania Cioloko from Philadelphia. Here she is. QUESTION: Please describe one action you would do to make the economic environment more favorable for small businesses and entrepreneurs and anyone dreaming of opening their own business. RUBIO: That’s a great question. WALLACE: Senator, how do you answer Tania? RUBIO: That’s a great question. First of all, it begins by having leaders that recognize that the economy we live in today is dramatically different from the one we had five years ago. It’s an economy that now has placed us in global competition with dozens of other countries around the world. Now, the big companies that have connections with Washington, they can affect policies to help them, but the small companies like the one Tania is talking about, they’re the ones that are struggling. The first thing we need to do is we need to even out the tax code for small businesses so that we lower their tax rate to 25 percent, just as we need to lower it for all businesses. We need to have a regulatory budget in America that limits the amount of regulations on our economy. We need to repeal and replace Obamacare and we need to improve higher education so that people can have access to the skills they need for 21st century jobs. And last but not least, we need to repeal Dodd-Frank. It is eviscerating small businesses and small banks. 20 — over 40 percent of small and mid-size banks that loan money to small businesses have been wiped out over the — since Dodd-Frank has passed. We need to repeal and replace Dodd-Frank. We need to make America fair again for all businesses, but especially those being run by small business owners. WALLACE: Senator Rubio, thank you. BAIER: Gentlemen, another question for a few of you. Here’s what two of your opponents on the five p.m. debate stage said about Iran. PERRY: I will tell you one thing. I would’ve a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry. Maybe we would’ve gotten a deal where we didn’t give everything away. FIORINA: When America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place. This is a bad deal. Obama broke every rule of negotiation. Yes, our allies are not perfect, but Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxy. BAIER: Now, I wanna ask a few of you this. First, Governor Walker. You’ve said that you would tear up the Iran deal on day one. If this deal is undone, what then? WALKER: Well, first off, let’s remember. I still remember, as a kid, tying a yellow ribbon around a tree in front of my house during the 444 days that Iran held 52 Americans hostage. Iran is not a place we should be doing business with. To me, you terminate the deal on day one, you reinstate the sanctions authorized by Congress, you go to Congress and put in place even more crippling sanctions in place, and then you convince our allies to do the same. This is not just bad with Iran, this is bad with ISIS. It is tied together, and, once and for all, we need a leader who’s gonna stand up and do something about it. It’s yet another example of the failed foreign policy of the Obama-Clinton doctrine. BAIER: Senator Paul, would you tear up the deal on day one? PAUL: I oppose the Iranian deal, and will vote against it. I don’t think that the president negotiated from a position of strength, but I don’t immediately discount negotiations. I’m a Reagan conservative. Reagan did negotiate with the Soviets. But you have to negotiate from a position of strength, and I think President Obama gave away too much, too early. If there’s going to be a negotiation, you’re going to have to believe somehow that the Iranians are going to comply. And I said, “well, how are we gonna get them to comply?” I would have never released the sanctions before there was consistent evidence of compliance. BAIER: Governor Huckabee, what do you think about what Senator Paul just said? HUCKABEE: Ronald Reagan said “trust, but verify.” President Obama is “trust, but vilify.” He trusts our enemies and vilifies everyone who disagrees with him. And the reason we disagree with him has nothing ot do with party. HUCKABEE: It has to do with the incredibly dangerous place that this world is gonna be as a result of a deal in which we got nothing. We didn’t even get four hostages out. We got nothing, and Iran gets everything they want. We said we would have anywhere, anytime negotiations and inspections, we gave that up. We said that we would make sure that they didn’t have any nuclear capacity, we gave that up. The president can’t tell you what we got. I’ll tell you what the world got. What the Iranians have said is, “we will wipe Israel off the face of the map, and we will bring death to America.” When someone points a gun at your head and loads it, by God, you ought to take them seriously, and we need to take that seriously. BAIER: Thank you, gentlemen. KELLY: Well, the first debate night of the 2016 presidential campaign continues from Cleveland after a short time-out. Stick around. Social issues, next. KELLY: Welcome back, gentleman. We’re going to move on now to discuss some social issues across the board. Governor Bush, let’s start with you. Many Republicans have been outraged recently by a series of videos on Planned Parenthood. You now say that you support ending federal funding for this organization. However, until late 2014, right before you started your campaign, you sat on the board of a Bloomberg charity that quite publicly gave tens of millions of dollars to Planned Parenthood while you were a director. How could you not know about these well publicized donations, and if you did know, how could you help a charity so openly committed to abortion rights? BUSH: I joined the Bloomberg Foundation because of Mike Bloomberg’s shared commitment for meaningful education reform. That’s why I was on it. We never had a debate about the budget. It was presented and we approved it. Not item by item. Here’s my record: As governor of the state of Florida, I defunded Planned Parenthood. I created a culture of life in our state. BUSH: We were the only state to appropriate money for crisis pregnancy centers. We expand dramatically the number adoptions out of our foster care system. We did parental notification laws. We ended partial-birth abortion. We did all of this and we were the first state to do a “choose life” license plate. Now 29 states have done it, and tens of millions of dollars have gone to create a culture where more people, more babies are adopted. KELLY: Did you know it? BUSH: No, I didn’t know. But it doesn’t matter. I was working on the board because of education. My record is clear. My record as a pro-life governor is not in dispute. I am completely pro-life, and I believe that we should have a culture of life. It’s informed by my faith from beginning to end. And I this not just as it related to unborn babies, I did it at the end of life issues as well. This is something that goes way beyond politics. And I hope one day we get to the point where we respect life in its fullest form across the board. KELLY: Senator Rubio, you favor a rape and incest exception to abortion bans. Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York just said yesterday those exceptions are preposterous. He said they discriminate against an entire class of human beings. If you believe that life begins at conception, as you say you do, how do you justify ending a life just because it begins violently, through no fault of the baby? RUBIO: Well, Megyn, first of all, I’m not sure that that’s a correct assessment of my record. KELLY: You don’t favor a rape and incest exception? RUBIO: I have never said that. And I have never advocated that. What I have advocated is that we pass law in this country that says all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection. In fact, I think that law already exists. It is called the Constitution of the United States. RUBIO: And let me go further. I believe that every single human being is entitled to the protection of our laws, whether they can vote or not. Whether they can speak or not. Whether they can hire a lawyer or not. Whether they have a birth certificate or not. And I think future generations will look back at this history of our country and call us barbarians for murdering millions of babies who we never gave them a chance to live. KELLY: Mr. Trump, in 1999, you said you were, quote, “very pro- choice.” Even supporting partial-birth abortion. You favored an assault weapons ban as well. In 2004, you said in most cases you identified as a Democrat. Even in this campaign, your critics say you often sound more like a Democrat than a Republican, calling several of your opponents on the stage things like clowns and puppets. When did you actually become a Republican? TRUMP: I don’t think they like me very much. I’ll tell you what. I’ve evolved on many issues over the years. And you know who else has? Is Ronald Reagan evolved on many issues. And I am pro-life. And if you look at the question, I was in business. They asked me a question as to pro-life or choice. And I said if you let it run, that I hate the concept of abortion. I hate the concept of abortion. And then since then, I’ve very much evolved. And what happened is friends of mine years ago were going to have a child, and it was going to be aborted. And it wasn’t aborted. And that child today is a total superstar, a great, great child. And I saw that. And I saw other instances. And I am very, very proud to say that I am pro-life. As far as being a Republican is concerned, I come from a place, New York City, which is virtually, I mean, it is almost exclusively Democrat. And I have really started to see some of the negatives — as an example, and I have a lot of liking for this man, but the last number of months of his brother’s administration were a catastrophe. And unfortunately, those few months gave us President Obama. And you can’t be happy about that. KELLY: Governor Bush, I want to ask you, on the subject of name calling of your fellow candidates, a story appeared today quoting an anonymous GOP donor who said you called Mr. Trump a clown, a buffoon, something else that cannot be repeated on television. BUSH: None of which is true. BUSH: No. It’s not true. But I have said that Mr. Trump’s language is divisive. I want to win. I want one of these people here or the ones at 5:00, to be the next president of the United States. We’re not going on win by doing what Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton do each and every day. Dividing the country. Saying, creating a grievance kind of environment. We’re going to win when we unite people with a hopeful, optimistic message. I have that message because I was a governor of a state that saw people lifted up, because we had high sustained economic growth. Our economy grew at double the rate of the nation. We created 1.3 million jobs. We led the nation seven out of those eight years. We were only one of two states that went to AAA bond rating. I cut taxes, $19 billion. If you do that and apply conservative principles the right way, you create an environment where everybody rises up. That’s how we’re going to win. Campaigning in places to give people hope that their life is better because too many people are suffering today in America. KELLY: Mr. Trump, 30 seconds. TRUMP: First of all, Jeb, I am very happy that you denied that, and I appreciate that very much. He is a true gentleman. He really is. One thing he did say, and I mean that. The one thing he did say about me, however, was my tone. And I also understand that. But when you have people that are cutting Christians’ heads off, when you have a world that the border and at so many places, that it is medieval times, we’ve never — it almost has to be as bad as it ever was in terms of the violence and the horror, we don’t have time for tone. We have to go out and get the job done. KELLY: The subject of gay marriage and religious liberty. Governor Kasich, if you had a son or daughter who was gay or lesbian, how would you explain to them your opposition to same-sex marriage? KASICH: Well, look, I’m an old-fashioned person here, and I happen to believe in traditional marriage. KELLY: How would you — how would you explain it to a child? KASICH: Wait, Megyn, the court has ruled, and I said we’ll accept it. And guess what, I just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay. Because somebody doesn’t think the way I do, doesn’t mean that I can’t care about them or can’t love them. So if one of my daughters happened to be that, of course I would love them and I would accept them. Because you know what? KASICH: That’s what we’re taught when we have strong faith. KASICH: So the issues like that, issues like that are planted to divide us. I think the simple fact of the matter is, and this is where I would agree with Jeb, and I’ve been saying it all along, we need to give everybody a chance, treat everybody with respect, and let them share in this great American dream that we have, Megan. So, look, I’m going to love my daughters, I’m going to love them no matter what they do. Because, you know what, God gives me unconditional love. I’m going to give it to my family and my friends and the people around me. MEGAN: Senator Paul, in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling on same sex marriage, Carol Fox on Facebook want to know the following. Quote, what will you do to ensure Christians are not prosecuted for speaking out against gay marriage and will Christians be forced to conduct business that conflicts with their religious beliefs? PAUL: Look, I don’t want my marriage or my guns registered in Washington. And if people have an opinion, it’s a religious opinion that is heartly felt, obviously they should be allowed to practice that and no government should interfere with them. One of the things, one of the things that really got to me was the thing in Houston where you had the government, the mayor actually, trying to get the sermons of ministers. When the government tries to invade the church to enforce its own opinion on marriage, that’s when it’s time to resist. MEGAN: Governor Walker, many in the Black Live Matter movement, and beyond, believe that overly-aggressive police officers targeting young African Americans is the civil rights issue of our time. Do you agree? And if so, how do you plan to address it? And if not, why not? WALKER: Well, I think the most important thing we can do when it comes to policing — it’s something you’ve had a guest on who’s a friend of mine Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clark, who’s talked to me about this many times in the past — it’s about training. It’s about making sure that law enforcement professionals, not only in the way in to their positions but all the way through their time, have the proper training, particularly when it comes to the use of force. And that we protect and stand up and support those men and women who are doing their jobs in law enforcement. And for the very few that don’t, that there are consequences to show that we treat everyone the same here in America. MODERATOR: Coming up more of our <debate>, including questions about President Obama’s foreign policy and these guys and their better ideas. Coming up. BAIER: Welcome back to Cleveland. Our next topic is foreign policy. Candidates, you may not have seen the late developing news today our Fox Pentagon team broke earlier this evening about a top Iranian general traveling to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. His name is General Qassem Soleimani, he’s blamed for hundreds of U.S. troops death in Iraq, and Afghanistan. His trip to Russia appears to directly violate U.N. Security Council resolutions to confine him to Iran. So, Mr. Trump, if you were president, how would you respond to this? TRUMP: I would be so different from what you have right now. Like, the polar opposite. We have a president who doesn’t have a clue. I would say he’s incompetent, but I don’t want to do that because that’s not nice. TRUMP: But if you look at the deals we make, whether it’s the nuclear deal with 24 hour periods — and by the way, before you get to the 24 hours, you have to go through a system. You look at Sergeant Bergdahl, we get Bergdahl, a traitor, and they get five of the big, great killers leaders that they want. We have people in Washington that don’t know what they’re doing. TRUMP: Now, with Iran, we’re making a deal, you would say, we want him. We want out our prisoners. We want all these things, and we don’t get anything. We’re giving them $150 billion dollars plus, they are going to be — I’ll tell you what, if Iran was a stock, you folks should go out and buy it right now because you’ll quadruple — this, what’s happening in Iran, is a disgrace, and it’s going to lead to destruction in large portions of the world. BAIER: …email. This comes in the wake of the director of national intelligence blaming the Chinese for the largest ever cyber attack, stealing personal data of tens of millions of Americans. Senator Cruz, in your view, have Russia and China committed of cyber war, and if you were president, what would you do about it? CRUZ: Well, Bret, of course they have, and over the last six and a half years we’ve seen the consequences of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy. Leading from behind is a disaster. We have abandoned and alienated our friends and allies, and our enemies are stronger. Radical Islam is on the rise, Iran’s on the verge of acquiring a nuclear weapon, China is waging cyber warfare against America, Russia — General Soleimani, you just mentioned, the Iranian general is the head of the al Quds forces. He’s directly responsible for the murder of over 500 American servicemen in Iraq, and part of this Iranian deal was lifting the international sanctions on General Soleimani. The day General Soleimani flew back from Moscow to Iran was the day we believed that Russia used cyber warfare against the joint chiefs. CRUZ: It is worth emphasizing that Iran released our hostages in 1981 the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office. BAIER: Dr. Carson, in August of 2012 President Obama famously declared Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons, quote, “that’s a red line for us,” and that there would be enormous consequences. One year later, and with overwhelming evidence the Assad had, in fact, used chemical weapons and crossed that red line, President Obama declined to use military force against the Assad regime. As president, would you have used military force there? CARSON: Well, what we have to stop and think about is that we have weakened ourselves militarily to such an extent that if affects all of our military policies. Our Navy is at its smallest size since 1917; our Air Force, since 1940. In recent testimony, the commandant of the Marine Corps said half of the non-deployed units were not ready and you know, the sequester is cutting the heart out of our personnel. Our generals are retiring because they don’t want to be part of this, and at the same time, our enemies are increasing. Our — our friends can’t trust us anymore. You know, Ukraine was a nuclear-armed state. They gave away their nuclear arms with the understanding that we would protect them. We won’t even give them offensive weapons. You know, we turned our back on Israel, our ally. You know, and a situation like that, of course Obama’s not going to be able to do anything. I would shore up our military first, because if you don’t get the military right, nothing else is going to work. BAIER: Governor Walker, as president, what would you do if Russian President Vladimir Putin started a campaign to destabilize NATO allies Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, mirroring the actions Putin took at the early days of Ukraine? WALKER: Well first off, for the cyber attack with Russia the other day, it’s sad to think right now, but probably the Russian and Chinese government know more about Hillary Clinton’s e-mail server than do the members of the United States Congress. And — and that has put our national security at risk. If I am president, he won’t think about that. You know, Putin believes in the old Lenin adage: you probe with bayonets. When you find mush, you push. When you find steel, you stop. Under Obama and Clinton, we found a lot of mush over the last two years. We need to have a national security that puts steel in front of our enemies. I would send weapons to Ukraine. I would work with NATO to put forces on the eastern border of Poland and the Baltic nations, and I would reinstate, put in place back in the missile defense system that we had in Poland and in the Czech Republic. We define (ph) steel. BAIER: Governor — Governor Huckabee, the culture of the American military is definitely changing. Women are moving into combat roles. Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell has obviously been dropped. And now Defense Secretary Ashton Carter recently directed the military to prepare for a moment when it is welcoming transgender persons to serve openly. As commander in chief, how would you handle that? HUCKABEE: The military is not a social experiment. The purpose of the military is kill people and break things. It’s not to transform the culture by trying out some ideas that some people think would make us a different country and more diverse. The purpose is to protect America. I’m not sure how paying for transgender surgery for soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines makes our country safer. … under President Obama. The disaster is that we’ve forgotten why we have a military. The purpose of it is to make sure that we protect every American, wherever that American is, and if an American is calling out for help, whether it’s in Benghazi or at the border, then we ought to be able to answer it. We’ve not done that because we’ve decimated our military. We’re flying B-52s. The most recent one that was put in service was November of 1962. A lot of the B-52s we’re flying, we’ve only got 44 that are in service combat ready, and the fact is, most of them are older than me. And that’s pretty scary. BAIER: Senator Paul, the first budget your proposed as senator cut all financial aid to Israel. You have since changed your view on that issue. What made you change your mind. PAUL: Well, let’s be clear, I’m the only one on the stage who actually has a five-year budget that balances. PAUL: … and I’ve said — and I’ve said I would cut spending, and I’ve said exactly where. Each one of my budgets has taken a meat axe to foreign aid, because I think we ought to quit sending it to countries that hate us. I think we ought to quit sending it to countries that burn our flag. Israel is not one of those. But even Benjamin Netanyahu said that ultimately, they will be stronger when they’re independent. My position is exactly the same. We shouldn’t borrow money from China to send it anywhere, but why don’t we start with eliminating aid to our enemies. BAIER: OK. But you still say that Israel could be one of the countries that is cut from financial aid? PAUL: I still say exactly what my original opinion is. Do you borrow money from China to send it to anyone? Out of your surplus, you can help your allies, and Israel is a great ally. And this is no particular animus of Israel, but what I will say, and I will say over and over again, we cannot give away money we don’t have. We do not project power from bankruptcy court. We’re borrowing a million dollars a minute. It’s got to stop somewhere. BAIER: Governor Christie, what do you think of that answer? CHRISTIE: Well, listen. You know, if we want to deal with these issues, we have to deal with them in a way that makes sense. I agree with what Dr. Carson said earlier. The first thing we need to do to make America stronger is to strengthen our military, and I put out a really specific plan: no less than 500,000 active duty soldiers in the Army. No less than 185,000 active duty marines in the Marine Corps. Bring us to a 350 ship Navy again, and modernize the Ohio class of submarines, and bring our Air Force back to 2,600 aircraft that are ready to go. Those are the kind of things that are going to send a clear message around the world. Those are the things that we need to start working on immediately to make our country stronger and make it better. Those are the things that we need to be able to be doing. And as we move towards dealing with foreign aid, I don’t disagree with Senator Paul’s position that we shouldn’t be funding our enemies. But I absolutely believe that Israel is a priority to be able to fund and keep them strong and safe after eight years of this administration. BAIER: Governor, thank you. CRUZ: Brett, can I — Brett, can I jump in on this one? BAIER: Senator, we’re going to finish up with some more questions, thank you. KELLY: We have to stand you by, because after the break, we’re going to let the candidates make their closing statements, their final thoughts, and God. In our final moments here together, we’re going to allow the candidates to offer their final thoughts. Senator Cruz, start from you. Any word from God? CRUZ: Well, I am blessed to receive a word from God every day in receiving the scriptures and reading the scriptures. And God speaks through the Bible. CRUZ: I’m the son of a pastor and evangelist and I’ve described many times how my father, when I was a child, was an alcoholic. He was not a Christian. And my father left my mother and left me when I was just three years old. And someone invited him to Clay Road Baptist Church. And he gave his heart to Jesus and it turned him around. And he got on a plane and he flew back to my mother and me. CRUZ: I would also note that the scripture tells us, “you shall know them by their fruit.” We see lots of “campaign conservatives.” But if we’re going to win in 2016, we need a consistent conservative, someone who has been a fiscal conservative, a social conservative, a national security conservative. There are real differences among the candidates on issues like amnesty, like Obamacare, like religious liberty, like life and marriage. And I have been proud to fight and stand for religious liberty, to stand against Planned Parenthood, to defend life for my entire career. And I will be proud to continue to do so as president of the United States. KELLY: Governor Kasich, same question. KASICH: Well, Megyn, my father was a mailman. His father was a coal miner. My mother’s mother could barely speak English. And their son today stands on this podium in the great state of Ohio not only as the governor, but a candidate for president of the United States. KASICH: I do believe in miracles. You know, I’ve had a lot of elections. But my elections are really not about campaigns. I tell my people that these are about a movement. And a movement to do what? To restore common sense. A movement to do things like provide economic growth. And a movement not to let anybody be behind. You know, today the country is divided. You asked a question about the police and the difficulty in communities. We’ve got to unite our country again, because we’re stronger when we are united and we are weaker when we are divided. And we’ve got to listen to other people’s voices, respect them, but keep in mind, and I believe in terms of the things that I’ve read in my lifetime, the lord is not picking us. But because of how we respect human rights, because that we are a good force in the world, he wants America to be strong. He wants America to succeed. And he wants America to lead. And nothing is more important to me than my family, my faith, and my friends. KELLY: Governor Walker, same question. WALKER: Well, thanks, Megyn. I’m certainly an imperfect man. And it’s only by the blood of Jesus Christ that I’ve been redeemed from my sins. So I know that God doesn’t call me to do a specific thing, God hasn’t given me a list, a Ten Commandments, if you will, of things to act on the first day. What God calls us to do is follow his will. And ultimately that’s what I’m going to try to do. And I hope people see it in my state, even in the big challenges I took on when I had over 100,000 protesters in and around our capital, trying to do what I thought was the right thing. It wasn’t just how I took on those political battles. It was ultimately how I acted. Not responding in kind. Not lashing out. But just being decent going forward and living my life in a way that would be a testimony to him and our faith. KELLY: Senator Rubio, I want to ask you the same question. But I do want to mention, a woman just came here to the stage and asked, what about the veterans? I want to hear more about what these candidates are going to do for our nation’s veterans. So I put the question to you about God and the veterans, which you may find to be related. RUBIO: Well, first, let me say I think God has blessed us. He has blessed the Republican Party with some very good candidates. The Democrats can’t even find one. RUBIO: And I believe God has blessed our country. This country has been extraordinarily blessed. And we have honored that blessing. And that’s why God has continued to bless us. And he has blessed us with young men and women willing to risk their lives and sometimes die in uniform for the safety and security of our people. Unfortunately today we have a VA that does not do enough for them. I am proud that last year we helped change the law. We changed the law to give the power to the VA secretary the ability to fire any executive that isn’t doing their job. And it is outrageous they’ve only fired one person to date. When I’m president of the United States, we’re going to have a VA that cares more about our veterans than about the bureaucrats who work at the VA. KELLY: Dr. Carson, a question to you about God and his role, but also, one of the issues that the public was very interested in, and we touched on it earlier, is race relations in this country, and how divided we seem right now. And what, if anything, you can do — you would do as the next president to help heal that divide. CARSON: Well, I think the bully pulpit is a wonderful place to start healing that divide. You know, we have the purveyors of hatred who take every single incident between people of two races and try to make a race war out of it, and drive wedges into people. And this does not need to be done. What we need to think about instead — you know, I was asked by an NPR reporter once, why don’t I talk about race that often. I said it’s because I’m a neurosurgeon. And she thought that was a strange response. And you say — I said, you see, when I take someone to the operating room, I’m actually operating on the thing that makes them who they are. The skin doesn’t make them who they are. The hair doesn’t make them who they are. And it’s time for us to move beyond that. CARSON: — our strength as a nation comes in our unity. We are the United States of America, not the divided states. And those who want to divide us are trying to divide us, and we shouldn’t let them do it. BAIER: Now each candidate will make a closing statement. You’ll all have 30 seconds to make a closing statement for this <debate>. We’ll start with Ohio Governor John Kasich. KASICH: You know, tonight we hear about what people want to do. I want to tell you what I’ve done. I was a member of the Armed Services Committee for 18 years. I spent a big chunk of my life studying national security issues and our role in the world. No. 2. I was the chairman of the House Budget Committee and one of the chief architects the last time we balanced a budget, and it was the first time we had done it since man walked on the moon. We had a $5 trillion surplus and we cut taxes. I spent ten years in the private sector, actually learning how business works. And now I’m the governor of Ohio, and I inherited a state that was on the brink of dying. And we turned it all around with jobs and balanced budgets and rising credit and tax cuts, and the state is unified, and people have hope again in Ohio. KELLY: Governor Christie? CHRISTIE: Well, thank you, Megyn. Listen, I was born into a middle class family in New Jersey. My dad came home from serving in the Army after having lost his father, worked in the Breyers ice cream plant in Newark, New Jersey. Was the first person to graduate from college. He put himself through college at night. My mom was a secretary. I was appointed United States attorney on September 10, 2001. And I spent the next seven years of my career fighting terrorism and putting terrorists in jail. I’m a conservative, pro-life governor in a state where it is really tough to be both. A state like New Jersey, with lots of Democrats, but still we cut taxes, we balanced budgets. We fought the teacher’s union. This president has had weak leadership, which has led to bad choices. We have got to stop worrying about being loved and start worrying about being respected. And that’s exactly how I’ll lead our country. WALLACE: Senator Paul, closing statement. PAUL: I’m a different kind of Republican. I’ve introduced a five-year balanced budget. I’ve introduced the largest tax cut in our history. I stood for ten and a half hours on the Senate floor to defend your right to be left alone. PAUL: But I’ve also gone to Chicago. I’ve gone to Detroit. I’ve been to Ferguson, I’ve been to Baltimore, because I want our party to be bigger, better and bolder, and I’m the only one that leads Hillary Clinton in five states that were won by President Obama. I’m a different kind of Republican. BAIER: Senator Marco Rubio. RUBIO: Thank you. You know, both of my parents were born into poor families on the island of Cuba. They came to America because it was the only place where people like them could have a chance. Here in this country, they never made it big, but the very purpose of their life was to give us the chance to do all the things they never could. My father was a bartender. And the journey from the back of that bar to this stage tonight, to me, that is the essence of the American dream. It is what makes our nation different. And I’m running for president because I want that to still be possible for the people trying to do that now. I run for president because I believe that we can’t just save the American dream; we can expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. And that’s why I’m asking for your vote. So we can make America greater than it has ever been. And make this century a new American century. BAIER: Thank you, Senator. KELLY: Senator Ted Cruz. CRUZ: If I’m elected president, let me tell you about my first day in office. The first thing I intend to do is to rescind every illegal and unconstitutional executive action taken by Barack Obama. CRUZ: The next thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into these videos and to prosecute Planned Parenthood for any criminal violations. CRUZ: The next thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice and the IRS to start (sic) persecuting religious liberty, and then intend to cancel the Iran deal, and finally move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. I will keep my word. My father fled Cuba, and I will fight to defend liberty because my family knows what it’s like to lose it. WALLACE: Dr. Carson, closing statement. CARSON: Well, I haven’t said anything about me being the only one to do anything, so let me try that. The — the only one to operate on babies while they were still in mother’s womb, the only one to take out half of a brain, although you would think, if you go to Washington, that someone had beat me to it. But I — but I’m very hopeful that I’m not the only onel who’s willing to pick up the baton of freedom, because freedom is not free, and we must fight for it every day. Every one of us must fight for it, because we’re fighting for our children and the next generation. BAIER: Governor Mike Huckabee, closing statement. HUCKABEE: It seems like this election has been a whole lot about a person who’s very high in the polls, that doesn’t have a clue about how to govern. A person who has been filled with scandals, and who could not lead, and, of course, I’m talking about Hillary Clinton. (UNKNOWN): Thank you. HUCKABEE: …is in trouble, but it’s not beyond repair. But it’s going to take leadership who sees the greatness of this country, and who believes that once again we can be one nation, under God. I’ll be my best to do that, and thank you for your support. KELLY: Governor Scott Walker. I’m guy with a wife and two kids, and Harley. I ran for governor because I was worried about my kids’ future. Then, I took on the big government union bosses, and we won. They tried to recall me, and we won. They target us again, and we won. We balanced the budget, cut taxes, and turned our state around with big, bold reforms. It wasn’t too late for Wisconsin, and it’s not too late for America. That’s why I ask for your vote. WALLACE: Governor Bush, closing statement, sir. BUSH: Here’s what I believe. I believe we’re at the verge of the greatest time to be alive in this world. But Washington is holding us back. How we tax, how we regulate. We’re not embracing the energy revolution in our midst, a broken immigration system that has been politicized rather than turning it into an economic driver. We’re not protecting and preserving our entitlement system or reforming for the next generation. All these things languish while we have politicians in Washington using these as wedge issues. Here’s my commitment to you, because I did it as Florida. We can fix these things. We can grow economically and restore America’s leadership in the world, so that everybody has a chance to rise up. I humbly ask for your vote, whenever you’re gonna get to vote, whenever the primary is. Thank you all very much. BAIER: Mr. Trump, closing statement, sir. TRUMP: Our country is in serious trouble. We don’t win anymore. We don’t beat China in trade. We don’t beat Japan, with their millions and millions of cars coming into this country, in trade. We can’t beat Mexico, at the border or in trade. We can’t do anything right. Our military has to be strengthened. Our vets have to be taken care of. We have to end Obamacare, and we have to make our country great again, and I will do that. BAIER: Gentlemen, thank you. KELLY: Are you relieved? You were nervous before, they — they don’t look relieved. Thank you all very much, and that will do it for the first Republican primary <debate> night of the 2016 presidential race. Our thanks to the candidates, who will now be joined by their families on stage.

Photo: AP Photo/John HellerLabor Day is traditionally a time for picnics and parades. But this year is no picnic for American workers, and a protest march would be more appropriate than a parade.Not only are 25 million unemployed or underemployed, but American companies continue to cut wages and benefits. The median wage is still dropping, adjusted for inflation. High unemployment has given employers extra bargaining leverage to wring out wage concessions.All told, it’s been the worst decade for American workers in a century. According to Commerce Department data, private-sector wage gains over the last decade have even lagged behind wage gains during the decade of the Great Depression (4 percent over the last ten years, adjusted for inflation, versus 5 percent from 1929 to 1939). Big American corporations are making more money, and creating more jobs, outside the United States than in it. Big American corporations are making more money, and creating more jobs, outside the United States than in it. If corporations are people, as the Supreme Court’s twisted logic now insists, most of the big ones headquartered here are rapidly losing their American identity.CEO pay, meanwhile, has soared. The median value of salaries, bonuses and long-term incentive awards for CEOs at 350 big American companies surged 11 percent last year to $9.3 million (according to a study of proxy statements conducted for The Wall Street Journal by the management consultancy Hay Group.). Bonuses have surged 19.7 percent.This doesn’t even include all those stock options rewarded to CEOs at rock-bottom prices in 2008 and 2009. Stock prices have ballooned since then, the current downdraft notwithstanding. In March, 2009, for example, Ford CEO Alan Mulally received a grant of options and restricted shares worth an estimated $16 million at the time. But Ford is now showing large profits – in part because the UAW agreed to allow Ford to give its new hires roughly half the wages of older Ford workers – and its share prices have responded. Mulally’s 2009 grant is now worth over $200 million.The ratio of corporate profits to wages is now higher than at any time since just before the Great Depression. The ratio of corporate profits to wages is now higher than at any time since just before the Great Depression. Meanwhile, the American economy has all but stopped growing – in large part because consumers (whose spending is 70 percent of GDP) are also workers whose jobs and wages are under assault.Perhaps there would still be something to celebrate on Labor Day if government was coming to the rescue. But Washington is paralyzed, the president seems unwilling or unable to take on labor-bashing Republicans, and several Republican governors are mounting direct assaults on organized labor (see Indiana, Ohio, Maine and Wisconsin, for example).So let’s bag the picnics and parades this Labor Day. American workers should march in protest. They’re getting the worst deal they’ve had since before Labor Day was invented – and the economy is suffering as a result.Published by arrangement with RobertReich.org .Robert Reich is Chancellor’s Professor of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley.

Keith Ashdown, the spokesman and chief sloganeer for a watchdog group, had been stewing about how to describe Alaska's Gravina Island Bridge in a news release. He wanted a catchy phrase that expressed the huge cost and dubious need for the milelong span. Then, as he stood beneath a Miller Lite sign at a bar called the Hawk 'n' Dove, he had a brainstorm. ""Bridge to nowhere!"" Four years later, the phrase has done what few political slogans can do. It shaped public opinion, influenced an election and pressured Congress to change its rules. Mentioned hundreds of times in newspapers, on TV and at countless dinner tables, it became shorthand for political pork and a Congress that was out of touch. ""It was an extraordinarily powerful image,"" said Rep. Adam Putnam, R-Bartow. ""It became a metaphor for a Republican majority that had lost its way on fiscal responsibility."" Language columnist William Safire called it ""the phrase that launched a thousand editorials."" Columnist George Will wrote after the November election: ""Republicans now know where the bridge to nowhere leads: to the political wilderness."" This is the story of three words that changed American politics. 'Pillow-talk pork' Ashdown is an unlikely Washington power broker. He has never held elected office, he's not a lawyer and he rarely wears a tie. A stocky 34-year-old with a deep voice and a belly built by beer, he looks more linebacker than lobbyist. He works for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington group that opposes corruption and government waste. He plays a unique role in the Washington power structure: part detective, part press agent. He gets tips about government shenanigans, verifies them, and then passes them to reporters with snappy quotes they can't resist. He described a project that helped a lawmaker's wife as ""pillow-talk pork"" and said Pentagon officials have ""spent money like Paris Hilton at a shoe sale."" Better than most in the nation's capital, Ashdown understands that the fewest words often say the most. That's why on that night at the bar in December 2002, he was determined to find just the right ones. The Golden Fleece He had learned of the Gravina Island Bridge a year earlier from an Alaskan environmentalist. He decided the $190-million bridge would be good for the Golden Fleece, a legendary award for dubious federal spending. The bridge would link the greater Ketchikan area, which has about 13,000 residents, with an island of 50 inhabitants that is home to the town's airport. It would replace a passenger ferry, but its main purpose was to encourage development on the island. ""It was really a bridge to the future of the community,"" said Blaine Ashcraft, executive director of the Greater Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce. Ashdown saw a boondoggle. His challenge was to make an obscure Alaskan bridge interesting, to find colorful words that would break through the din of messages competing for the public's attention. He was by no means the first to use the phrase ""bridge to nowhere."" It has been used for decades to describe unpopular bridges, including spans from Pittsburgh to Pensacola. On June 12, 2003, Ashdown issued a press release announcing the Golden Fleece award was going to Rep. Don Young, the Alaska Republican who sponsored the bridge. At first, it looked like the effort was off to a great start. Within hours, the Associated Press in Alaska published a story. But the phrase did not appear. Months went by. No one used the phrase. Ashdown was discouraged. All that work and all he had to show for it was one measly AP story. 'A little oinker' In the spring of 2004, Ashdown got a call from Timothy Egan of the New York Times, who was writing a story about the Gravina bridge and another one known as Knik Arm in Anchorage. During several interviews with Egan, Ashdown said ""bridge to nowhere"" at least 40 times. Egan's story, ""Built With Steel, Perhaps, but Greased With Pork,"" ran on the front page of the Times on Saturday, April 10, 2004. It marked the media debut of the phrase Ashdown, in Paragraph 16: ""It's a gold-plated bridge to nowhere ..."" and it portrayed the bridge as part of a money-grab by Alaska's congressional delegation. Egan quoted Young, who chaired the powerful transportation committee, boasting that he wanted to be ""a little oinker."" Once again, it looked like Ashdown's phrase was about to take off. The next day, on Meet the Press, when Sen. John McCain was asked about boosting military spending without increasing the deficit, he complained about ""bridges to nowhere in Alaska."" But again it fell flat. Despite Ashdown's salesmanship, the bridge to nowhere wasn't ready for prime time. The span was merely a proposal and had not been approved by Congress. The 2004 presidential campaign was dominating the news and voters weren't especially bothered about political pork. Smoking pot? In the summer of 2005, when Congress began considering a highway bill, there was an uptick of interest in the bridge. Journalists repeated the phrase in stories that skewered the pork-laden bill. At this point, Alaska leaders might have been able to quash the controversy if they had given a cogent defense of the bridge. The state had been blessed with two lawmakers who had the clout to get millions for the bridge - Young and Sen. Ted Stevens. But they also happened to be two of the most mercurial lawmakers in the U.S. Capitol. As criticism mounted, Young, who had boasted that he stuffed the bill ""like a turkey,"" told the Associated Press that, ""These people keep saying it's nowhere, they're just smoking pot."" The opposition was gaining ground, but not quickly enough. Congress passed Young's highway bill, with the bridge tucked inside. On Aug. 10, the president signed it into law. The tale of Ashdown's phrase might have ended here. But two stories gave it new life. Duke Cunningham, a California lawmaker under investigation, had drawn attention to congressional pork because he had earmarked money for a defense contractor in return for bribes. Then along came Hurricane Katrina. As cost estimates for the hurricane soared, lawmakers on Capitol Hill began looking for expensive federal projects that could be cut or delayed. The bridge to nowhere was the perfect target. 'Kiss my ear' Suddenly, Ashdown's phrase exploded in the media. In editorials, op-ed columns and TV news shows, the bridge was cited as a case study of federal priorities that were out of whack. As McCain said on CNN, ""Do the American people want their tax dollars to go to the victims of Hurricane Katrina - and now Rita - or do they want it to go to a bridge to nowhere?"" An editorial in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch groused about the highway bill ""larded with pork barrel public works projects like bridges to Nowhere, Alaska."" A letter to the editor of the Chattanooga Times Free Press declared that ""$200-million bridges to nowhere in Alaska and other outrageous pork projects have to be eliminated."" Young sneered at his critics' suggestion that he give back the money. ""They can kiss my ear,"" he said. In the Senate, Tom Coburn, R-Okla., proposed cutting federal money from the Gravina and Knik Arm bridges and directing much of it to repair a span in Louisiana damaged by the hurricane. Coburn said it was ""time for us to change our priorities."" Stevens, in an emotional, fist-pounding speech, said Coburn was attacking not the bridges, but Alaska itself. He thundered that it was wrong for a senator to steal another senator's pork. ""I will put the Senate on notice - and I don't kid people - if the Senate decides to discriminate against our state and take money only from our state, I will resign from this body."" Stevens defeated the amendment 82-15. But he hadn't stopped the growing furor around the nation. Pop status Three weeks later, Parade magazine, circulation 34-million, cemented the pop status for the bridge with a cover story titled, ""A Visit to The Bridge to Nowhere."" That marked a turning point when the phrase reached critical mass and began to have serious political consequences. Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., was so worried that he wrote to House Speaker Dennis Hastert warning that the phrase was damaging their party. ""Ask anyone what the 'bridges to nowhere' are and they will tell you they are a serious example of a Republican Congress bringing home some of the most expensive bacon in history on the taxpayers' dime,"" Flake wrote. Across the nation, in campaign events and town hall meetings, members of Congress heard a chorus of complaints about the bridge to nowhere. It seemed everyone knew about it. On the CBS-TV drama Threshold, one of the characters spoke derisively of the government paying for ""bridges to nowhere."" In the St. Petersburg Times, a letter to the editor used the phrase to lambast government funding for a bridge on the 15th hole at the Dunedin Country Club. Ashdown's phrase spawned imitators. There was the ""wall to nowhere"" (the border fence between the United States and Mexico), the ""runway to nowhere"" (at the St. Louis airport) and the ""railway to nowhere"" (a rail line in Mississippi). But Rep. Young, oblivious to the growing PR problem, scoffed at the criticism and disputed Flake's claim that the bridge was harming their party. ""He hasn't got any traction,"" Young told the Anchorage Daily News. ""He's a dog lying on ice right now: He's scratching a lot but he doesn't go anywhere."" In Ketchikan, community leaders were frustrated. In their view, the news media distorted the story, but they couldn't agree on how to respond and opted to say little. As a result, the national debate remained lopsided. The critics kept attacking, but Stevens, Young and the Ketchikan leaders failed to mount a forceful response. Collateral damage Congressional leaders had tried to quell the controversy by removing the earmarks for Gravina and Knik Arm from a spending bill, but they did not cut Alaska's transportation money by the same amount, so the state was still free to build the bridges with federal dollars. The phrase, fueled by the Parade cover story, a segment on ABC's 20/20 and countless mentions on talk radio, kept spreading. As the 2006 campaigns got underway, Flake's prediction was coming true: The bridge had become a serious political liability. Amazingly, a bridge to a tiny Alaska island was now an issue in House and Senate races in Rhode Island, Michigan, New York and Minnesota. It came up in debates and was a dependable attack line against Republican incumbents. Brian Riedl, an analyst with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the phrase was as evocative as the $400 hammer that symbolized Pentagon waste in the 1980s. In Rhode Island, Republican Sen. Lincoln Chafee was pummeled from the right and the left for voting with Stevens on the bridge. The conservative Club for Growth ran TV ads that blasted him for supporting ""that bridge to nowhere boondoggle up in Alaska."" Chafee ended up losing his seat. Analysts say the bridge was a factor. Nationally, the phrase also played a role in the Democrats seizing control of Congress. The Iraq war and disapproval of President Bush were the main forces, but the strong public disapproval of the Republican Congress - fueled by the phrase Ashdown conceived in a bar four years earlier - played its part. Jennifer Duffy, an analyst with the Cook Political Report, said the phrase drove home the message, ""Republicans were not being good stewards of your tax dollars."" When the Democrats took over in January, their first order of business was to change House rules to require more disclosure of individual projects like bridges. The rule change reflected a remarkable cultural shift on Capitol Hill, that political pork was no longer universally popular. Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., said his party heard a clear message from the November elections: No more bills for special interests and ""no more bridges built to nowhere."" Epilogue Ashdown has become a minor celebrity in Washington and is introduced at cocktail parties as the guy who coined the phrase. He resists the notion that the bridge to nowhere is his masterpiece, hopeful that some day he'll dream up something even better. Friends often ask him to concoct a phrase for them. ""We need a title like a bridge to nowhere. Got anything?"" But despite his success in branding the slogan and changing public views on political pork, Congress is back to its old ways. To pass a spending bill a week ago, the Democratic leadership stuffed it with pork in true Don Young-Ted Stevens style. Ketchikan leaders still hope the bridge will go somewhere. But they fear state officials have lost their enthusiasm. The governor's new budget did not provide any money for the project. Ashcraft, of the Ketchikan chamber, says he's concerned that the state's elected officials ""are starting to grow weary of the battle.""

""He hasn't got any traction,"" Young told the Anchorage Daily News. ""He's a dog lying on ice right now: He's scratching a lot but he doesn't go anywhere."" In Ketchikan, community leaders were frustrated. In their view, the news media distorted the story, but they couldn't agree on how to respond and opted to say little. As a result, the national debate remained lopsided. The critics kept attacking, but Stevens, Young and the Ketchikan leaders failed to mount a forceful response. Congressional leaders had tried to quell the controversy by removing the earmarks for Gravina and Knik Arm from a spending bill, but they did not cut Alaska's transportation money by the same amount, so the state was still free to build the bridges with federal dollars. The phrase, fueled by the Parade cover story, a segment on ABC's 20/20 and countless mentions on talk radio, kept spreading. As the 2006 campaigns got underway, Flake's prediction was coming true: The bridge had become a serious political liability. Amazingly, a bridge to a tiny Alaska island was now an issue in House and Senate races in Rhode Island, Michigan, New York and Minnesota. It came up in debates and was a dependable attack line against Republican incumbents. Brian Riedl, an analyst with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the phrase was as evocative as the $400 hammer that symbolized Pentagon waste in the 1980s. In Rhode Island, Republican Sen. Lincoln Chafee was pummeled from the right and the left for voting with Stevens on the bridge. The conservative Club for Growth ran TV ads that blasted him for supporting ""that bridge to nowhere boondoggle up in Alaska."" Chafee ended up losing his seat. Analysts say the bridge was a factor. Nationally, the phrase also played a role in the Democrats seizing control of Congress. The Iraq war and disapproval of President Bush were the main forces, but the strong public disapproval of the Republican Congress - fueled by the phrase Ashdown conceived in a bar four years earlier - played its part. Jennifer Duffy, an analyst with the Cook Political Report, said the phrase drove home the message, ""Republicans were not being good stewards of your tax dollars."" When the Democrats took over in January, their first order of business was to change House rules to require more disclosure of individual projects like bridges. The rule change reflected a remarkable cultural shift on Capitol Hill, that political pork was no longer universally popular. Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., said his party heard a clear message from the November elections: No more bills for special interests and ""no more bridges built to nowhere."" Ashdown has become a minor celebrity in Washington and is introduced at cocktail parties as the guy who coined the phrase. He resists the notion that the bridge to nowhere is his masterpiece, hopeful that some day he'll dream up something even better. Friends often ask him to concoct a phrase for them. ""We need a title like a bridge to nowhere. Got anything?"" But despite his success in branding the slogan and changing public views on political pork, Congress is back to its old ways. To pass a spending bill a week ago, the Democratic leadership stuffed it with pork in true Don Young-Ted Stevens style. Ketchikan leaders still hope the bridge will go somewhere. But they fear state officials have lost their enthusiasm. The governor's new budget did not provide any money for the project. Ashcraft, of the Ketchikan chamber, says he's concerned that the state's elected officials ""are starting to grow weary of the battle.""

One sentence in a NYC couple’s suicide note tells the story of how so many Americans are feeling about health care these days. With premiums skyrocketing, it’s difficult to pay for healthcare even if you don’t have “medical issues” like this couple did. This is tragic and is symbolic of the desperation so many people are feeling right now.A Manhattan couple committed suicide just a few hours after Senate Republicans tried to pass a bill that would repeal Obamacare.But three members of their own party – including Sen. John McCain – voted against the bill and it failed to pass, keeping the Affordable Care Act in place for now.The couple jumped out of a window of a New York City office building together in desperation over their inability to afford their health care: ‘We both have medical issues, we just can’t afford the health care.’The incident happened early Friday morning on the corner of Madison Avenue and 33rd Street – just a block from the Empire State Building.A 53-year-old chiropractor and his 50-year-old wife jumped out of a window of their recently-closed ninth-floor office in the 17-story building.Their bodies were covered with white sheets once police arrived at the scene, shutting down the entire block to investigate.The couple left behind suicide notes in a ziploc bag, that also included their IDs. Police have not released their names yet, but a photo obtained by the New York Post shows part of the letter, and it identifies the woman as Patricia. The note was titled ‘We had a wonderful life’. A law enforcement source who spoke with the Post said the woman’s note said: ‘Our kids are upstairs, please take care of them’.The man left one behind too, which read: ‘We both have medical issues, we just can’t afford the health care.’The building that the couple jumped from includes offices for law and advertising firms, therapists offices and commercial space.No further information on the couple has been released. It’s unclear how many children they left behind.Perry Kim, 49, a worker at Pure Green, a juice shop on the same block, said that he was outside just after 5:30am this morning when he heard an ‘ahhh’ noise and saw two people fall from the top of the building.The man appeared to hit his head and the woman had suffered abdominal injuries. They landed face up to the sky.

Hurd was appointed to the committee and that he himself is the one who said he was quitting the committee to focus on other committees. If anyone mischaracterized the events - it's Rep. Hurd. I think any rational person would think that - if this was all a clerical error - then you would expect that to be stated in the letter. Instead of just saying it was a clerical error, he gave an entirely different reason. If anyone here was being dishonest, it's Rep. Hurd. But I would also add that I find it incredibly difficult to believe that Rep. Hurd and his staff only found out about the appointment from a committee press release on 1/23. The Congressional Record from the 1/13, the day that committees were announced, lists Hurd as being on the small biz cmte. It was announced on the House floor, approved by unanimous consent and printed in the record. Here's the link and I also attached as a pdf - http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?r114:3:./temp/~r114zfJ0fa:: That doesn't prove or disprove our statement but, considering how much anticipation there is for committee assignments, I find it completely implausible to believe that neither Rep. Hurd nor any member of his staff either saw the announcement on the House floor or read the congressional record. So perhaps he was appointed in error but this was not a typo on a press release - all the things we said were true - according the the record, he clearly was in fact appointed to the committee, and according to his own letter, he did resign and he did give as his reason a desire to focus on his other committees.

Ginny Burdick, D-Portland, talks with Senate President Peter Courtney, D-Salem, in this file photo. Michael Lloyd/The Oregonian In the wake of the Clackamas mall shootings, Oregon state Sen. Ginny Burdick, D-Portland, on Wednesday launched an effort to round up support for legislation to ban the sale of high-capacity gun magazines. In an email to colleagues seeking co-sponsors for a bill she plans to introduce for the 2013 legislative session, Burdick wrote:According to news reports, the shooter yesterday was able to rapidly fire about 60 shots. This terrifying situation exemplifies the danger of large capacity magazines in our community. Large capacity magazines can dramatically increase death tolls and have no legitimate place in our neighborhoods. Burdick said she introduced similar legislation in 2011 but was unable to get a hearing on the bill. She said the Clackamas shootings -- along with a spate of other shootings involving a gunman able to rapidly fire a large number of shots -- might lead to more political support for her proposal.MoreContinuing coverage of the fatal shooting at Clackamas Town Center that left three people dead.""I'm not saying this will end gun violence,"" said Burdick. ""But if people can't go waltzing into a gun shop and buy a 50-round magazine, I think that is a positive step.""The draft of Burdick's bill would ban gun clips containing more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Burdick said she didn't think there was a legitimate use for average citizens to have higher capacity clips, and she said in her email to colleagues: Even hunters are restricted from using large capacity magazines: there is a five cartridge limit for large game hunting, and three for bird hunting. If we limit capacity for hunting animals, why do we not extend that principle to guns that may harm our neighbors?Burdick has been a longtime proponent of gun control legislation. Along with Oregon sheriffs, she sponsored a 2000 initiative approved by Oregon voters that required background checks on purchasers at gun shows. She sponsored the initiative after she fell just short of getting the Oregon Legislature to pass a similar bill.UPDATE: Lobbyists for gun owners blasted Burdick and said they didn't think limiting the size of gun clips would have any value.""There's no particular reason to pick a number of rounds a person should have,"" said Kevin Starrett of the Oregon Firearms Federation. He said that if these restrictions were adopted, shooters could still use multiple clips or weapons. According to news reports, the shooter yesterday was able to rapidly fire about 60 shots.

They were also widely reported on by the national media. Here’s a quick summary from the report. Please let us know if you need anything else.Kim In 2013, ICE freed 36,007 convicted criminal aliens from detention who were awaiting the outcome of deportation proceedings, according to a document obtained by the Center for Immigration Studies. This group included aliens convicted of hundreds of violent and serious crimes, including homicide, sexual assault, kidnapping, and aggravated assault. The list of crimes also includes more than 16,000 drunk or drugged driving convictions. The vast majority of these releases from ICE custody were discretionary, not required by law (in fact, in some instances, apparently contrary to law), nor the result of local sanctuary policies.The document reveals that the 36,007 convicted criminal aliens freed from ICE custody in many instances had multiple convictions. Among them, the 36,007 had nearly 88,000 convictions, including:193 homicide convictions (including one willful killing of a public official with gun)426 sexual assault convictions

In large measure because if local law enforcement begins to act like immigration enforcement officers, what that means is that you will have people not reporting crimes. You will have people hiding from the police. And I think that is a real direct threat to the personal safety and security of all the citizens. So this is a result of the failure of the federal government, and that’s where it needs to be fixed.Russert: But you would allow the sanctuary cities to disobey the federal law.Clinton: “Well, I don’t think there is any choice. The ICE groups go in and raid individuals, but if you’re a local police chief and you’re trying to solve a crime that you know people from the immigrant community have information about, they may not talk to you if they think you’re also going to be enforcing the immigration laws. Local law enforcement has a different job than federal immigration enforcement. The problem is the federal government has totally abdicated its responsibility.”During an interview with Bill O’Reilly in 2008, highlighted this week by MRCTV, Clinton was equally on board with the idea of sanctuary policies:O’Reilly: Are you going to crack down on the sanctuary cities?Clinton: No, I’m not. And I’ll tell you why.O’Reilly: Whoa.Clinton: I’m not, I’m not because the reason why a lot of those folks do it — in New York, why do police officers turn a blind eye?O’Reilly: Because they want them to report crimes.Clinton: They want them to report crimes. Because…O’Reilly: Doesn’t override.Clinton: …the — well, sometimes you have two competing values. You want to report crime, you want to protect people and the violence spills way beyond whatever community…In the wake of the murder of Kate Steinle at the hands of a multiple-deportee, multiple felon — Clinton is now saying cities should cooperate with federal officials:CNN’s Brianna Keilar: “Last week, an undocumented immigrant who had been deported five times, killed a 32-year old woman, Kate Steinle, in San Francisco, a sanctuary city where local law enforcement does not enforce federal immigration laws. When you last ran for President you supported sanctuary cities. In light of this terrible incident, does that change anything about your view on this?”Clinton: “Well what should be done is any city should listen to the Department of Homeland Security, which as I understand it, urged them to deport this man again after he got out of prison another time. Here’s a case where we’ve deported, we’ve deported, we’ve deported, he ends back up in our country and I think the city made a mistake. The city made a mistake not to deport someone that the federal government strongly felt should be deported. So I have absolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted on. However, there are, like if it were the first-time traffic citation, if it were something minor, a misdemeanor, that’s entirely different. This man had already been deported five times, and he should have been deported at the request of the federal government.”Read More Stories About:Comment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Gerry Connolly on government workers under political fireBy Ed O'KeefeMore and more, when politicians talk about government employees -- whether they are federal, state or local -- it is with the kind of umbrage ordinarily aimed at Wall Street financiers and convenience store bandits.Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.)The Federal Eye and colleague Karen Tumulty write in Tuesday's Washington Post about the growing backlash against public sector employees -- an issue of special interest in the Washington area, which is home to about 600,000 federal workers.Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) represents about 56,000 of them who live in Northern Virginia. The Federal Eye spoke with him last week about the growing public sector backlash. A transcript -- edited for space -- appears below:Question: What do you make of this increased rhetoric against public sector workers, specifically, federal employees?""I think it's very easy for politicians to demonize federal employees. Politically, it costs very little to do that. But I think in terms of what it does in the cost to public service is considerable. Ultimately, the loser is the public itself, because the more you make public service unattractive, the more you reinforce stereotypes.""These aren't just nameless, faceless people who work in the bowels of a bureaucracy, they are real people who provide real services for real people. It just demeans public service in a way that ultimately costs the public.""Does this feel like something new or more intense than he has seen before? Is it new?""I think we've been doing this since the age of Ronald Reagan, maybe even Jimmy Carter. I'm a child of the 1960s, I remember John Kennedy and he ennobled public service. Starting around Jimmy Carter and certainly perfected by Ronald Reagan, we had a very different message about public service. I think we've been fighting that battle back and forth ever since.""What about President Obama: Is he closer to Reagan or Kennedy when it comes to public service and federal workers?""I think he's in between. Personally, he certainly believes in the nobility of service and would believe it's a calling that's worthy. But on the other hand, as a politician, I think he too quickly singled out federal employment as, 'That's the one I'm going to pluck out and put on the scoreboard. That's where we're going to save money.'""My reaction was, I believe federal employees and certainly the unions who represent them are willing to make a sacrifice and put some commitments on the table as part of this national cause of reducing red ink. But help me understand why of all the items on the menu being served up by the Deficit Reduction Committee, the White House in advance picks this one and says this is what we're going to do. And this one just happens to be aimed and about federal employment.Then what should he have picked otherwise?""I think the president unwittingly contributed to this unfriendly, if not hostile climate with respect to federal employment, and I think that's too bad. That's not the same as saying that they shouldn't be willing to make a sacrifice, but signaling it out in advance of the commission's report I think calls out the value we put on that service. To me, that's an unfortunate message that just piles on.""So where is this anti-public sector debate headed?""I think the Congress we elected in November is a lot less hospitable to the interests of federal employees. I think you're going to see a lot more legislative action and suggestion aimed at reducing the size and compensation of that federal workforce and retirees.""Going right at the benefits, going right at the size of the workforce, and frankly, being a lot less attuned to the quality of that workforce. Facts be damned: There's a lot of rhetoric on the other side about the growth of the federal workforce, but it's about the size it was under the first President Bush. There hasn't really been a lot of net growth in the federal workforce when you compare it to say, 1990. It's not like it's gotten out of hand, it's true. I'm afraid that in the focus of reinforcing a stereotype is what will be lost in discussions are the ones we ought to be having, which are the quality of the workforce.""Where are we going to get the sophisticated skillsets we need for the future if we're demeaning that service in the first place? I think it's self-defeating. It's a compelling issue, because an awful lot of people are qualified to retire.""What if anything are you going to do combat this?""If the other side of the aisle is willing to engage in meaningful reforms, where we can have win-win, and we're able to get more out of the federal workforce, I'm all for that. The president just signed my bill on telework last week. There are a lot of other initiatives that can upgrade how we do things in the federal workplace and how we recruit and retain skilled workers.What is really driving this debate?""What's the political cost back in Utah or Idaho or Wyoming? What's the cost of picking on the federal bureaucrat? It kind of feeds the narrative of this big, out or control federal bureaucracy that is so far removed from where you live and work that it's an unnecessary impediment to the rest of us getting on with our lives.""It's a powerful narrative in the sense I suppose of the American story, this fierce independence of Americans who, by nature are a little mistrustful of government. That's healthy. But to despise the public servant and demonize that public servant, with impunity, does a real disservice to public service and is dangerous in terms of the quality of the government we're going to need as we move forward.""""The next Congress almost guarantees that they'll be a lot more attackers than defenders. People like me are going to have a much harder job to make the case, because I think there are fewer willing ears.""Read the full story and leave your thoughts in the comments section below2010"
http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/sep/19/charley-wilkison/texas-top-state-law-enforcement-deaths-line-duty/	"""Texas has lost the most law enforcement officers in the line of duty of any state in America."""	true	['Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'History']	http://www.texasstandard.org/	http://www.texasstandard.org/stories/police-operating-on-heightened-sense-of-reality-after-dallas-shooting/	2016/09/19	Flickr/dallashabitatphotos (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)The nation is mourning the loss of five Dallas police officers after a shooting Thursday night.Police departments across the country, and especially across Texas, have been reeling from last week’s police shooting in Dallas – mourning officers lost, but also operating on a heightened sense of alert.For many departments, this sense of alert means more officers on the streets, more tactical units on standby, and new questions about how police interact with the public.Charley Wilkison , executive director of the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, says that officers are feeling the effects of recent events.“Of course, there’s an acknowledgement and sorrow, and the realization of what’s occurred,” Wilkison says, “and then this grim determination and commitment to soldier on to do what they’ve been called to do.”He says that officers have to face a reality check in the wake of events like last week’s shooting.“There’s a heightened sense of reality. Because the fear part, of course, officers are trained to deal with that,” Wilkison says. “Texas has lost the most law enforcement officers in the line of duty in each state in America, and so that’s absolutely something they aware of coming into the job.”Texas will be sending 150 officers to assist with security at the upcoming Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio. Wilkinson says that he’s concerned for the safety of those officers, given the climate surrounding Donald Trump’s campaign.“I’m fearful that something will happen to them, especially with some of the political circumstances surrounding Donald Trump’s candidacy,” Wilkison says. “It seems to be very heated, and in very heated moments where people are clashing, and physical confrontations that we’ve all seen, I’m worried about those officers.”Listen to the full interview in the audio player above.Post by Alexandra Hart.Cancel replyNO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE, YOU’RE ON TEXAS STANDARD TIME©2014 Texas Standard.

She and her parents stepped off the MARTA bus stop nearby and walked toward the guards booth, where they were met with the blunt response.You cant come in here, she remembers the guard on duty telling them.As one of Georgias high school valedictorians, Abrams had been invited to meet the governor, along with other students across the state. The other valedictorians and their parents gained entrance without delay.AdvertisementAdvertisementJust think about being 17 years old, standing at these gates, one of the most important days of your life, and youre told you dont belong here, she tells The Root. That brands you. That stays with you.Her father, Robert, was able to convince the guard that they had been invited to the event, and the family eventually got in, but neither Abrams nor her parents remember being inside. They just recall being told they werent welcome. The experience expanded Abrams appreciation of how power, or proximity to it, could harm or exclude people.I did not know until much later that this was a memory that really propelled her to make sure that things were equal, that there is a level playing field for everybody else, Abrams mother, Carolyn, said in a phone interview.AdvertisementAbrams, 44, tells that story wherever she goes. It won over audiences at each event at which I saw her speak in December when I trailed along on her campaign stops. Its the story that fuels her resolve to become Georgias top politician. Last summer, Abrams gave up her seat and position as minority leader in the Georgia Statehouse to run for governorand if she wins, she would become the first black female governor in U.S. history.Shes betting on the progressive people of Georgia who have been ignored: immigrants and the working poor of all races. Her critics say the votes shes pursuing are simply not therethat conservative Georgia will never elect a progressive candidate, let alone a black woman, as governor. Her Democratic primary rival, Stacey Evans, a former Georgia legislator, is also formidable and is sure to give Abrams a run for her money all the way up to the primary election in May. AdvertisementFor those who suspect that Georgia wont go blue, consider this: By 2025, Georgia is expected to become a minority-majority state; U.S. census data has Georgias current white population at 61 percent (recent data says that white registered voters dropped from 59 percent of Georgias electorate to under 57 percent in 2016), while black population stands at 32 percent, Latino at 9.4 percent and Asian at 4.1 percent. Abrams believes that theres a growing, multiracial coalition of Georgians who are ready to elect her.AdvertisementThe goal that I have is to ensure that we build a coalition that reflects that opportunity, she says. Because we are so close to [racial] parity, and no other state is positioned where we are in terms of the composition of that parity. We have the voters ... to build a brand-new coalition we havent really seen in a Southern state.AdvertisementAbrams run is really a defining moment for the Democratic Party as a whole. Given that black women pretty much elected Alabama Democrat Doug Jones to the U.S. Senate, some national observers believe the party owes them Abrams. The Democrats have long been the more progressive of the two dominant parties, but that means they have come to rely on the black vote while still mostly running white candidates. Now is the hour of reckoning for the Democrats to step up and live up to their supposed ideals of being for the working class and minorities.They have an opportunity to support a candidate who embodies what the future of the party should be, says L. Joy Williams, chairwoman of Higher Heights. The question is whether or not the party, and not just the DNC [Democratic National Committee], the Democratic Governors Association, all of the fundraising apparatuses, will have the wherewithal and the guts to stand up and work their hardest to ensure we have a victory in Georgia.AdvertisementOr, put it this way: Black people have always believed in white Democrats and vigorously voted for them. No matter how imperfect. In Georgia, will white Democrats, statewide and nationally, believe in Stacey Abrams?Two weeks before Jones upset Roy Moore in Alabama, I speak with Abrams in her small office at her campaign headquarters in Atlanta. Tax-law books are stacked on shelves by her desk. Before winning her seat in the Georgia Legislature in 2006, Abrams was the deputy attorney for the city, a position she held 2003-2006. Wearing her signature twist-outs and brimming with a confident calm, she tells me why shes primed to win the governors race this year.AdvertisementAdvertisementShe points out that in the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton lost the state to Donald Trump by 5 percentage points, a 3-point improvement on Barack Obamas showing in 2012. Obama and Clinton could have won Georgia, Abrams believes, had they devoted more resources to her state.Those are all communities ripe for engagement if we respect them enough to do the same work for them that were willing to do for the other side, she says. One of the reasons Im running is that I have a long history of unapologetically progressive values. I have stood in my truth and done the work, and I know that it is time to bring that to a broader swath of Georgians.I watch Abrams tell a conference table of 12 leaders of the Muslim community in Clarkston, Ga., as much one Saturday afternoon. Sitting at the head of the table, she fields questions about how she would take on Islamophobia if elected governor of Georgia in November. One man mentions the anti-Islam rally held on the steps of the state Capitol in Atlanta last year.Stacey Abrams speaking to constituents at a roundtable discussion in Clarkston, Ga. (Terrell Jermaine Starr/The Root)If youre the governor, how would you respond to that? he asks.Abrams, without hesitation, says she would condemn the rally and tell any Muslim working that day that they could go home.You dont have to subject yourself to that kind of abuse, she adds.Heads nod approvingly.Another attendee tells Abrams that there is a lot of rhetoric dividing the country. What will you do to unite Georgia? she asks.AdvertisementAdvertisementWeve allowed divisive nationalism make us forget who we are as Americans, Abrams responds. And our responsibility is to be, not just a haven, but an incubator for good ideas and opportunity. Having communities that are able to integrate, not assimilate, but to integrate into the broader community is a healthy thing for a community.One of Abrams aides politely rises and cautions it is time for the candidate to sit for her interview with a local radio station across the hall in the same building. The host thanks Abrams and insists that she return. Abrams says she will.Clarkston is just 30 minutes outside Atlanta and takes in 1,500 refugees a year and has welcomed as many as 25,000especially those from Africa and Southeast Asiaover the past 25 years. Many of these residents are now citizens who can vote. As Abrams explains, there are enough Clarkstons to pull her through. She has more than 200 volunteers knocking on doors and making phone calls throughout the state to reach them.AdvertisementShe raised half-a-million dollars for the race by June of 2016 (her campaign will release campaign filings for the remainder of the year in March) and has picked up some major endorsements, including those of Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) and former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner of Bernie Sanders Our Revolution. Nationally, she has rock-star appeal. At each of the campaign events I visited, lines formed, with folks wanting to frame themselves in history before a history-making event potentially happens: a black women in the governors mansion.Stacey Abrams with Rep. John Lewis in an undated photo (courtesy of Stacey Abrams for Governor) The DNC indicates that it understands the symbolism of Abrams run. Though the DNC doesnt engage during primaries, the bodys Black Caucus Chair Virgie M. Rollins said in an email to The Root that it invested nearly $1 million in the Alabama general election to mobilize that states black voters.AdvertisementAdvertisementOur victories in Virginia, New Jersey and our historic win in Alabama with the election of Doug Jones, which wouldnt have been possible if we had not invested in the Alabamas African-American community, Rollins added.Abrams knows that there are doubters who feel her candidacy is nothing more than wishful thinking.White folks in Georgia would never vote for a black person for governor. Especially a black woman.People are too stuck in their ways. Its just not her time yet.State Rep. Al Williams (D-Midway), one of Abrams early supporters, pushes back against such assertions, saying that one advantage Abrams has is that she is running statewide and not out of a district, where shed have to contend with gerrymandered voting areas that make it hard for black people to compete.AdvertisementAdvertisementTheres not a better time to have a Stacey Abrams running for governor than now, he says. Republicans are singing the same old song, most times playing to peoples fears. Georgia is in change mode. A whole lot of people who moved here since the last governors race are not hard-core red or blue. Theyre looking for true leadership.A Yale-trained lawyer, Abrams says that she registered 200,000 people to vote in Georgia in 2008 through her organization, New Georgia Project. She was the minority leader of the state Assembly 2011-2017. She doesnt run away from being a black woman. She embraces it, in fact. But she doesnt want it to be the only marker that defines her, either.Im not running because Im a person of color, Im not running because Im a woman. But because of both of those parts of who I am, I have to navigate challenges that a lot of other folks havent had to deal with, she tells me. I have to answer questions that others arent asked.On the evening of Dec. 2, I go to Gainesville, Ga., just 35 minutes outside of Atlanta, to see Abrams speak at a meeting organized by the Hall County Democratic Party. She tells that story about being denied entry to the governors mansion to a racially diverse crowd of people, young and old. Some cover their mouths in shock. Some of the older black women sitting in the back shake their heads.AdvertisementAdvertisementOne of them writes a check to Abrams campaign soon after she finishes her remarks.In the same speech, Abrams talked about having been born in Wisconsin and growing up in Gulfport, Miss., before moving to Decatur, Ga., with her family. She was a star student, and most of her five siblings did well for themselves, too. One, Leslie, is a federal judge; her older sister Andrea is a tenured professor. Janine, her younger sister, is an evolutionary biologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Her brother Richard is a behavioral health counselor who works with foster kids down in southwest Atlanta.Top row: Stacey Abrams; brother Walter; sister Andrea and sister Leslie. Bottom row: Abrams father, Richard; sister Jeanine; brother Richard; and mother, Carolyn. (Courtesy of Stacey Abrams for Governor) Then there is Walter, who dropped out of Morehouse College and is currently serving prison time in Mississippi. He has mental health issues and feels his recidivism issues stem from his lack of access to mental health care, a reason Abrams is so passionate about expanding Medicaid.AdvertisementWalter is one of the reasons Im so committed to expanding Medicaid because it provides mental health insurance, she says. It is a critical piece of what happened to him.AdvertisementThat was what won over Jennifer LaRose, a white woman who brought her two children to hear Abrams speak. LaRose voted Republican until Barack Obamas second term. One of her sons has health issues and relies on Medicaid to help cover costs. LaRose likes that Abrams wants to expand Medicaid (Georgias current governor, Nathan Deal, elected not to expand it). Abrams view is something LaRose believes will help the candidate win over lots of people like her.Its going to win over a lot of people on both sides of the aisle, she says.Abrams desire to expand Medicaid also struck a chord with Deborah Mack, a black woman who once served as Hall County commissioner. She says that Abrams story should resonate with enough voters in Georgia to win, but black people need to do their part to make it happen.AdvertisementI think a black woman can win in the state of Georgia, but we have to not be so complacent and take it for granted its going to happen, she says. We have to work, too. We have to get out there and vote.As a minority leader, Abrams earned a reputation for being unafraid of taking on GOP leadership and working with them when her hands were tied. The GOP had the state House of Representatives, the Senate and the governorship, making Abrams ability to pass progressive legislation nearly impossible. So she had to negotiate with Republicans, often making a bad bill not so bad.AdvertisementOne of them was 2016s House Bill 941, a bipartisan bill that curtails grand jury privileges for officers who shoot and kill on duty. Prior to this bill, police officers were permitted to be present during the entire grand jury proceedings, make a statement at the end, and be exempt from being questioned. Georgia was the only state that allowed this privilege, Abrams campaign says. AdvertisementAbrams worked with Republicans and law enforcement to make sure cops had to be questioned. However, some lawmakers in her own party felt that she sided with Republicans too much, a charge Carolyn Hugley, who served as minority whip while Abrams was leader, says is unfair.When youre the leader of the minority party, you first have to think about Lets do no harm or the least harm to the citizens we care about, Hugley says. When you are in that leadership position, sometimes youre going to take the position others feel is not a pure position. Minimize the harm to be done when you dont have the power to make the final decision.LeDawn Jones, a former state representative and a supporter of Abrams primary opponent Stacey Evans, said during a phone interview that she respects both Abrams and Evans and believes that Democrats are in a great position for the general election regardless of who wins the primary. However, while Jones described Abrams as a genius, she that said Abrams was not a real progressive. She didnt do nearly enough to challenge Republicans in power and could have done more to challenge the GOPs authority, Jones added.AdvertisementSo many areas that I think we could have made a bigger impact to let people know that we were fighting for them, Jones said. She had a very difficult job and no one expected it to be done to perfection. But when you ask if shes a progressive leader in todays progressive movement, I think a true progressive leader would have used that position as minority leader to bring light to a lot more progressive social justice issues.AdvertisementIn an email, Abrams campaign spokesperson Caitlin Highland rejected those claims, saying that Abrams has called for the removal of Confederate monuments as a gubernatorial candidate and led protests against the Confederate flag. As a member of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus and as minority leader, Abrams deferred to the leadership of the GLBC, which was debating efforts to remove Confederate monuments, Highland wrote.Stacey Evans campaign said that the candidate was not available for an interview, but her spokesperson, Seth Clark, wrote in an email to The Root that Evans and Abrams worked alongside each other well, even through their disagreements. Evans strongest criticism of Abrams comes in how the former minority leader brokered the states HOPE scholarship program (Georgias tuition-free Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally program) with Republicans. Clark charged that it was one of the worst pieces of legislation in years.AdvertisementBecause of the [Georgia Gov. Nathan] Deal-Abrams bill, roughly a quarter of the technical college student body dropped out, Clark wrote.In response, Highland said that Abrams hands were tied.In 2011, Gov. Deal proposed legislation to overhaul Georgias HOPE scholarship, a merit-based scholarship program funded by lottery sales that was rapidly approaching insolvency after the Great Recession, Highland said in an email. The original HOPE bill funded universal pre-K for 4 year olds, higher education funding and technology. Under Abrams leadership, Democrats fought to prevent certain cuts and make sure the bill included funding for remedial classes at technical colleges, a 1 percent low interest loan program, and prevented the use of ACT/SAT testing standards that would have harmed poor students and students of color. In addition, [Abrams] prevented Republicans from cutting a full day of pre-K for 4 year olds to a half daya key achievement of the compromise.In 1992, an uprising erupted outside the gates of Spelman College after the Los Angeles police officers who were captured on video mercilessly beating Rodney King were found not guilty. Abrams was a sophomore at the all-womens HBCU at the time. She remembers coughing from the tear gas that cops fired into the crowds and that made its way on to campus. News articles from that day report 22 people and 17 officers were hospitalized; 70 were arrested in connection with the riots. State police dressed in riot gear surrounded the state Capitol. National Guard helicopters flew over the business district to protect property.AdvertisementAdvertisementA student at nearby Atlanta University (now known as Clark-Atlanta University) at the time told the Los Angeles Times that officers came on campus to disperse students protesting the verdict. It was a peaceful protest, said Andrea Henderson, an Atlanta University student and resident of a freshman dormitory. The police came on campus and tried to disperse us. I dont think they had the right to do that.Abrams at Spelman College in an undated photo (courtesy of Stacey Abrams for Governor) Abrams felt that then-Mayor Maynard Jacksons response was too aggressive. Even more troubling to her were the ways in which local media depicted black people.AdvertisementI was angry, Abrams says. I started a phone tree in my dorm and started calling all of the reporters at ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox News, telling them they were wrong about what was happening and were mischaracterizing what was going on, and that they needed to stop.Abrams and some of her classmates were invited to a public forum, where they aired their issues with the citys response to Jackson. He pointedly told her that she didnt know what she was talking about, as she remembers the exchange, but the experience taught her to speak truth to power. It also endeared her to Jackson. Abrams and a classmate were offered internships with the citys Office of Youth Services. It was her first real taste of public service.AdvertisementIll never forget. They came into the office and said, We dont want to be interns. We want to be research assistants, Melanie Campbell, who oversaw the department, remembers Abrams telling her. They did good research, though.AdvertisementI tell Abrams that she, too, may deal with civil unrest as governor. One day, she may have to consider deploying law enforcement to handle the kinds of uprisings that have taken place in Baltimore, New York City and Ferguson, Mo. The kind that rocked Los Angeles and Atlanta and other cities around the nation while she was a student. I ask her if she had seen any examples of public officials handing the aforementioned uprisings inappropriately.If you look at some of the reaction, there is an aggression that takes place sometimes that far outweighs the potential harm that could be done, Abrams says. We have seen time and again that there is a difference in response depending on the racial complexion of the protest. And that is problematic. I do not ever question the responsibility of our law enforcement to protect citizens. But I do question and always will ask, and demand as governor, that that reaction be responsive to not our fears of what will happen but the reality of whats on the ground.It is a carefully tailored response. If she does become governor and faces the unfortunate circumstance of civil uprising in response to police brutality, it will be interesting to see how the activism that pushed her to challenge a sitting mayor while a Spelman student will influence her response to police abuse as a governor.Abrams meets around 40 volunteers at a MARTA station in Northeast Atlanta to canvas neighborhoods in nearly Decatur on a cool-by-Atlanta-standards Saturday morning in December. Some of them strategically stake Abrams for Governor campaign signs wherever the dirt gives. It is a diverse crowd, but black women are prominent. Abrams is running a multicultural campaign based on a very multicultural message, but if she is to win, it will very likely be because of black women, as was the case for Doug Jones in Alabama.AdvertisementAdvertisementAngela Crawford, one of the volunteers, tells me her parents are 93 years old and never imagined their votes would elect the first black president. Neither is able to go out and physically vote, so they cast absentee ballots. Crawford says that shell help her parents make history twice for Abrams in Mays Democratic primary.They saw it could happen with [Obama], so they believe it can happen for the next person, she says. Im going to make sure that next year, when we get ready to vote, that they will cast their ballots.In 2008, Obama was running on hope and change. In 2018, Abrams is running against hate, despair and an oligarchy that has turned the White House into a kleptocracy. Donald Trump is all the way up in Washington, D.C., but his policies are pushing Abrams to warn her supporters of what could happen if a Republican wins the governors race: Trump 2.0.AdvertisementIn 2016, Georgia came within 200,000 votes of making sure the orange occupant did not take the White House, she tells her supporters at the MARTA stop that morning. For too long, we havent done the work of touching every single person. We talk to people we know about the things we like and we hope theyll figure it out. But we know the way to create change is to reach out beyond ourselves.Then, she returns to the story of how she was denied entry to the governors mansion, a rallying cry for the dozens of supporters surrounding her.AdvertisementAll I remember was a man at a gate, telling me that I dont belong. Telling me this wasnt my state. That I possibly couldnt deserve to be inside, she says. I think about that when Im standing here because MARTA got me from Decatur to the governors mansion before, and today, I think its going to do it again.AdvertisementFrom there, her small group of canvassers splits up into groups, maps out which parts of Decatur theyll target and get to knocking on doors of residents they hope will get Abrams into the governors mansion. This time, the guard will know her name.

PELOSI: My pleasure. AMANPOUR: Can I ask you about some of the important news that's been made this week, particularly in -- in the House and that would be on Afghanistan. Last year, 32 Democrats voted against the funding of the war in Afghanistan. This year, 102 Democrats voted against. That seems to be a dramatic rejection from the president's own party of his major strategic goal. PlayInterview With Speaker Pelosi PELOSI: Well, not quite. You have to put the votes in perspective. Our president came in. He was president maybe two months, three months, by the time we took the vote last year. And the Republicans said they weren't going to vote for the funding. And so it took all Democratic votes. I persuaded my members to give this president a chance, to give him room in order to have time to implement his plan. And in -- and in the course of time -- now the Republicans said they would vote for it, it gave my members the freedom to express themselves on the war in Afghanistan. PlayInterview With Secretary Gates (Part 1)AMANPOUR: Now, you didn't vote. PELOSI: No. AMANPOUR: I know the speaker doesn't have to vote. PELOSI: Right. AMANPOUR: But how would you have voted? PELOSI: Well, we brought the bill to the floor. And that was a statement that said that we knew that our troops needed to have what was -- what they needed to have would be provided for them. So we will never abandon our men and women in uniform. On the other hand, it gave our members a chance to express their view. PlayInterview With Secretary Gates (Part 2)AMANPOUR: How long do you think you can keep your skeptical members, as you call them, on side? PELOSI: Well, again, we have a -- varying degrees of expression here. We are there, we've taken an oath to defend the constitution and therefore the American people. And that's what people will be looking at -- how does this figure into our protecting the American people? Is it worth it? AMANPOUR: Well, is it worth it? PELOSI: Yes. AMANPOUR: Is it worth it? PELOSI: That's the question. AMANPOUR: But that's my question to you. PELOSI: Well, we will -- as I said, we will see the metrics as they unfold in the next few months and certainly by the end of this year. AMANPOUR: But what does your gut tell you? PELOSI: in my visits to afghanistan, the last time i was there was over mother's day weekend to visit the troops///and the four metrics that we have always used year in and year out on these visits have been about security. And the military tells us this cannot be won militarily solely. Secondly, governance and ending corruption..... AMANPOUR: I'm just trying to figure out, for instance, you know, what you think is the right thing to do in Afghanistan at the moment. Look, ""Time"" magazine, this week, has this as its cover -- a girl whose had her nose and ears cut off by the Taliban. You know, to put it right down to its basics, is America going to abandon the women of Afghanistan, the people of Afghanistan again? PELOSI: Well, first of all, we're in Afghanistan because it's in our strategic national interests to be so for our own national security, to stop terrorism, to increase global security. The women of Afghanistan have been a priority for many of the women in Congress -- and men, too, but the women have taken a special interest. When I was there in -- around Mother's Day, I went to a province in Southern Afghanistan and visited with women. And we talked about the education of their children, the health of women and the rest. And they -- especially their daughters.- they said we want that, but that can't happen without security. And these women in this remote province told us and that can't happen without the end of corruption. So what we would like to see is for President Karzai be a more reliable, a stronger partner, ending the corruption, increasing -- improving the governanceAMANPOUR: Vice President Biden, talking about the dead line for the transition, which is summer of 2011, he said on this program a week or two ago that there's going to be a drawdown of forcesBIDEN SOT---""it could be as few as a couple thousand troops it could be more. but there will be a transition""Does that square with -- with what you think, that it could just be a couple of thousand troops? PELOSI: Well, I hope it is more than that. I know it's not going to be turn out the lights and let's all go home on one day. But I do think the American people expect it to be somewhere between that and a -- a few thousand troops. AMANPOUR: Let's go to something much closer to home right now at the moment and that is the ethics conundrum with Representative Rangel. How does your affection and your respect for him as a colleague square with what's going on right now and what you said and declared, that this is going to be the -- the -- the most ethical Congress ---- that you're going to drain the swamp of any kind of wrongdoing and corruption, etc.? PELOSI: When I came in, I said we're draining the swamp. And we did. We have passed the most sweeping ethics reform in the history of the Congress. Any personal respect and affection we may have for people makes us sad about the course of events, but we have to pull the high ethical standard and none of our personalities is more important than that. AMANPOUR: Can you see Congressman Rangel ever returning as chairman of the Ways and Means or in any position of leadership in -- in the House? PELOSI: Well, the -- the Ethics Committee is working its will andAMANPOUR: No matter what happens? PELOSI: it's an elementary discussion, because what we have done is to wait and see what the Committee decides. I respect what they do. I'm totally out of the loop. It is independent. It is confidential, classified, secret, whatever. We don't know what it is. But we do respect the work that the members of the Committee do. AMANPOUR: Let me ask you about the mid-term elections. You are, by all accounts, one of the most -- if not the most -- powerful and successful speakers of -- in the history of the United States. You've passed so much legislation. The president was elected with a significant majority. You had control of both houses of Congress. And yet now, people are talking about you might lose your majority in the House. The gap seems to be growing wider between what's achieved and what's making an impact with the people. How did this happen? PELOSI: Well, that's one version of the story. And --(CROSSTALK)from outsiders perspective.... AMANPOUR: -- because many people are asking that --PELOSI: Yes. AMANPOUR: ... how did you get to this place where, perhaps, you might lose your majority? PELOSI: We don't see it that way. We are very proud of the agenda that we have put forth to the American people. our recovery package, as the economists have said, we've had twice as many people unemployed as there are now if we had not moved forward. These actions are all controversial because we were digging our way out of a deep ditch. so we've been legislating for the past 18 months. The other side has been in campaign mode for 18 months, saying no, stopping job creation and the rest. But our members are the best salespersons for their own districts. They've been elected there. They know their constituents. AMANPOUR: Are you nervous about November? PELOSI: No, I'm not nervous at all --AMANPOUR: Not at all? PELOSI: No. I'm -- I'm --AMANPOUR: Because people say I know you're putting on a great face --has you have toPELOSI: -- that's not. AMANPOUR: -- going into an election. But people say there's been considerable worry about what will happen in November. PELOSI: Well, let me say this. I never take anything for granted. And our agenda now is we're not going forward -- we're not going back to the failed policies of the Bush administration. We're going forward. AMANPOUR: So what does it make you feel, then, when the president's own spokesman said that you might lose the majority? PELOSI: Well, I -- you know, I --AMANPOUR: well how do you feel about itPELOSI: -- with all due respect -- I don't spend a whole lot of time thinking about what the president's employees say about one thing or another. AMANPOUR: But it directly impacts --PELOSI: Well, the -- they must realize that. But you know what, I'm speaker of the House. I have a great chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Chris Van Hollen. We have a solid plan of messaging and mobilize -- mobilizing at the grassroots level and management of our campaigns. And we have a two to one advantage money-wiseSo we feel very confident about where we are, whether that's well known to that gentleman or not. AMANPOUR: Let me ask you about the tax cuts. Are you going to take that issue to -- to a fight before the elections, letting the tax cuts for the -- for the two -- 250,000 expire and then keep them on for the middle class? PELOSI: Well, the -- the tax cuts for the wealthiest -- of the $250,000 and above -- were the -- the Bush initiative. I dont see any reason why we should renew a tax cut that only gives a tax cut to the wealthiest people in America, increases the deficit and doesn't create jobs. That doesn't make any sense. AMANPOUR: But I know that's your position, butPELOSI: YesAMANPOUR: -- to the middle class --PELOSI: But to keep the middle class tax cuts--AMANPOUR: Would you take this to a vote before the electionPELOSI: It would be my hope. But let me just say, on The Recovery Act, nearly $300 billion of The Recovery Act were tax cuts for the middle class. most people dont realize thatThe Republicans want to have the tax cut and they want it unpaid for -- $700 billion added to the deficit for an initiative that does not create jobs. AMANPOUR: Can I show you something? PELOSI: Sure. AMANPOUR: there's so much polarization, so much partisanship, so much -- not just amongst the politicians, but in the press, amongst the people. You talked a little bit about what, you know, us and them, in your view. I want to show you this, which is a Republican commercial. TV AD//RIGHTCHANGE.COM(TAKE VIDEO CLIP FULL) AD NATSAMANPOUR: Oh, you haven't seen it? PELOSI: I have not seen that, but I have seen that in campaigns there isAMANPOUR: So what do you think --AMANPOUR: -- you being the -- the bogeyman? PELOSI: Well,-- what I know about that is that they tried this. This is their campaign in Pennsylvania 12, the 12th Congressional District of Pennsylvania. Their whole campaign was an attack on the president and on -- on Pelosi. AMANPOUR but it was youPELOSI: ...... and I said to to the president i think they may have gotten more focus here than you for this one time. And they fully expected to win the race and we won by 8.5 points. Because this is funny, it attracts attention, but they have nothing to say about what they want to go for, what they want to do is privatize Social Security. And as they have said, their agenda, if they win, is to go to the exact agenda of the previous administration and people will look with fondness on the Bush administration....we welcome that campaignAMANPOUR: -- for me, looking in from outside, it just seems -- that's seems to be a never-ending partisanship. What is it you can do for the people in this highly polarized situation. PELOSI well first of all, what you define as, you describe as a highly polarized situation is a very big difference of opinion. The Republicans are here for the special interests, we're here for the people's interests. The president said we will measure our progress, our success, by the progress that is made by America's working families. That is our priority. That is not their priority. This isn't about inter-party bickering. This is about a major philosophical difference as to whose side you're on. You don't like to think that. We come here to find our common ground. That's our responsibility. But if we can't find it, we still have to move. I've never voted for a perfect bill in my life. I don't think anyone hasI wish it were not so stark. I wish the elections weren't so necessary for us to win. I really do, because it should be -- there should be more common ground. Are we unhappy that our not -- the -- the job creation has not gone as fast as we would like? Well, we were digging out of a very deep hole. But we will continue to fight. AMANPOUR: Speaker Pelosi, thank you very much, indeed, for joining us. PELOSI: Well, I look forward to welcoming you back soon again. And congratulations to you and much success. AMANPOUR: Thank you. AMANPOUR: Secretary Gates, thank you very much for joining us and welcome to ""This Week"". GATES: Thank you. AMANPOUR: Let's start with WikiLeaks. How can an ordinary soldier sitting at his computer, apparently listening to Lady Gaga or whatever, spew all this stuff out with nobody knowing? GATES: It's -- it's an -- it's an interesting question, because had -- had he tried to do this or had whoever did this tried to do it at a -- a rear headquarters, overseas or in pretty much anywhere here in the U.S., we have controls in place that would have allowed us to detect it. But one of the changes that has happened as we have fought these wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has been an effort to put the -- put as much information and intelligence as far forward to the soldiers as we possibly can, so that at a forward operating base, they -- they know what the security risks are to them and they -- and they also have information to help them accomplish their mission. So -- so we put an enormous amount of information out at a -- at the secret level and push it the furthest forward possible. And so it is this -- it -- it was much easier to do in theater and in Afghanistan or Iraq than it would have been at a rear headquarters or here in the U.S. AMANPOUR: So do you now have to reassess that -- much less intelligence going to the forward bases? GATES: I think we have to look at it, although I must say, my bias is that if one or a few members of the military did this, the notion that we would handicap our soldiers on the front lines by denying them information in an effort to try and prevent this from happening -- my bias is against that. I want those kids out there to have all the information they can have. And so we're going to look at are there ways in which we can mitigate the risk, but without denying the forward soldiers the information. AMANPOUR: How angry were you -- beyond the fact that classified information is out there -- the substance of it? GATES: Well, I'm not sure anger is the right word. I just -- I think mortified, appalled. And -- and if -- if I'm angry, it is -- it is because I believe that this information puts those in Afghanistan who have helped us at risk. It puts our soldiers at risk because they can learn a lot -- our adversaries can learn a lot about our techniques, tactics and procedures from the body of these leaked documents. And so I think that's what puts our soldiers at risk. And -- and then, as I say, our sources. And, you know, growing up in the intelligence business, protecting your sources is sacrosanct. And -- and there was no sense of responsibility or accountability associated with it. AMANPOUR: You know, you talk about putting your sources at risk, a Taliban spokesman has told a British news organization that they are, indeed, going to go after any of those names that they find in this treasure trove of documents and they will, as they say, they know how to deal with people. Are you worried? I mean Admiral Mullen said that this leak basically has blood on its hands? GATES: Well, I mean given the Taliban's statement, I think it -- it basically proves the point. And my attitude on this is that there are two -- two areas of culpability. One is legal culpability. And that's up to the Justice Department and others. That's not my arena. But there's also a moral culpability. And that's where I think the verdict is guilty on WikiLeaks. They have put this out without any regard whatsoever for the consequences. AMANPOUR: So let me ask you about a couple of things that came out. One is the possibility that the Taliban may have Stinger missiles. Do they, do you think? GATES: I don't think so. AMANPOUR: At all? GATES: I don't think so. AMANPOUR: The other is about Pakistan. Again raising the notion that Pakistan, no matter how much you say they're, you know, moving in your direction, helping with this fight against the Taliban and against al Qaeda, that they still are hedging their bets, that elements in Pakistan continue to hedge their bets or out and out support the Taliban and what they're doing in Afghanistan. How much of a problem is that for you? GATES: Well, it -- it is a concern, there's no question about it. But -- but I would say that, again, we walked out on Pakistan and Afghanistan in 1989 and left them basically holding the bag. And -- and there is always the fear that we will do that again. And I believe that's the reason there's a certain hedge. But what I see is a change in the strategic calculus in Pakistan. As they see these groups attacking Pakistan itself, where they are more and more partnering with us and working with us and fighting these insurgents and 140,000 soldiers in Northwestern Pakistan fighting some of the same insurgents we are. AMANPOUR: Right. But they're basically fighting the insurgents that are threatening them. They haven't gone into, for instance, these safe havens which still exist, Northern Waziristan. And General Jones, the national security adviser, has told ""The Washington Post"" that these safe havens are a big question mark in terms of our success rate. So unless they do that, cut off those safe havens, will you succeed in Afghanistan? GATES: Well, I think we can but --AMANPOUR: Even if the safe havens --GATES: -- but we clearly --AMANPOUR: -- exist? GATES: -- we clearly would like for them to go after the safe havens. But they have gone after the safe haven -- some of the safe havens, in South Waziristan and Swat and elsewhere, places where, 18 months ago, I wouldn't have believed the Pakistanis would be actively engaged -- and militarily. And so the Pakistanis going after any of these groups, I believe, overall, helps us in what we're trying to accomplish, both with respect to Afghanistan and with respect to al Qaeda. AMANPOUR: But given the way the war is going right now and given the fact that the Taliban are very wily and very adaptable enemies and they do have a place where they can go across the border and hide, can you afford to wait for the Pakistanis to -- to move on into Northern Waziristan? GATES: I think that the -- first of all, we are increasing our cooperation with the Pakistanis in terms of working on both sides of the border, in terms of trying to prevent people from crossing that border. We are increasing our forces in Eastern Afghanistan that will help us do this. So I think that -- I think we're moving in the right direction here. AMANPOUR: But you don't have an open-ended period of time. The president has clearly said that the summer of 2011 is a period of transition. And many people are interpreting that in all sorts of different ways, as you know. The Taliban is clearly running out the clock -- it's trying to run out the clock. Let me put something up that David Kilcullen, the counter-insurgency expert, a former adviser to General Petraeus, said about the timetable. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID KILCULLEN: They believe that we had stated a date certain, that we were going to leave in the summer of 2011. And they immediately went out and spoke to the population and said, the Americans are leaving in 18 months, as it was then. What are you doing on the 19th month? Who are you backing? Because we'll still be there and they won't be. (END VIDEO CLIP)AMANPOUR: So that question is out there. So many people are arranging their schedules for 2011 -- the summer of 2011. But my question to you is this, what can General Petraeus do to defeat the Taliban at their own game? What can he do now in Afghanistan to avoid this deadline that they're setting for themselves? GATES: Well, first of all, I think we need to re-emphasize the message that we are not leaving Afghanistan in July of 2011. We are beginning a transition process and a thinning of our ranks that will -- and the pace will depend on the conditions on the ground. The president has been very clear about that. And if the Taliban are waiting for the nineteenth month, I welcome that, because we will be there in the nineteenth month and we will be there with a lot of troops. So I think that --AMANPOUR: But what is a lot of troops? GATES: Well, first of all, I think that -- my personal opinion is that -- that drawdowns early on will be of fairly limited numbers. And as we are successful, we'll probably accelerate. But, again, it's -- it will depend on the conditions on the ground. AMANPOUR: Is there any way now -- between now and December, between now and next -- next summer, to deliver some high profile, real reconstruction, real sort of progress to them to make everybody know that you're serious and to change the dynamic? GATES: Well, first of all, I think we're already seeing that. We're already seeing it in Central Helmand, where security development and governance, economic returning. We are seeing it in places like Nad Ali. We're actually seeing it in places like Marjah, that has been slower and tougher than we anticipated, but it's getting better every day. And we're seeing it in gradually improving security in the area around Kandahar. It's going to take some time. It's going to be tough. We're going to take casualties. We have warned about this for months, that this summer would be very difficult for us. But I think there are tangible signs that this approach is working, this strategy is working. But the key thing to remember is the full surge isn't even all I Afghanistan yet and will not be until the end of August. So this surge over the last few months is only beginning to take effect. AMANPOUR: What I think a lot of people maybe don't get is that the Afghan people still want the American forces there. In the latest ABC poll, it shows that 68 percent of the Afghan people actually want the American forces still there. Do you think that there has been an opportunity missed or should there be an opportunity seized by yourself, maybe by the president, to go out and speak to the American people more about -- about Afghanistan, about the strategy, about why it's important? GATES: Well, first of all, I'm here. And I think the president has been out and has spoken about this. He talked about it in some detail at the time he nominated General Petraeus, about where we were headed. Probably we can do more. But Secretary Clinton and I and the president and the vice president and General Jones have all been out and -- and talking about this. And -- and I think -- you know, frankly, one of the things that I find frustrating is that I think that the president's strategy is really quite clear. I hear -- I hear all the stories that say what's the strategy, what's the goal here? I think it's quite clear. It's to -- it's to reverse the momentum of the Taliban, deny them control of populated areas, degrade their capabilities at the same time we're building up the Afghan security forces, so that the Afghan security forces can deny the Taliban and al Qaeda a base from which to attack the United States and the West. AMANPOUR: All right. GATES: It's pretty straightforward. AMANPOUR: OK. Then let me -- since you brought that up, I want to bring up what Vice President Biden told NBC earlier this week about the strategy and about -- about the aims, because, again, I think the American people and many people are confused about what is the -- what is winning, what is the strategy right now? Let me put that up. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOSEPH BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are in Afghanistan for one express purpose -- al Qaeda. The threat to the United States -- al Qaeda that exists in those mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan. We are not there to nation-build. (END VIDEO CLIP)AMANPOUR: Is that it? GATES: That's good. AMANPOUR: Is that the war? GATES: I agree with that. We are not there to -- to take on a nationwide reconstruction or construction project in Afghanistan. What we have to do is focus our efforts on those civilian aspects and governance to help us accomplish our se -- our security objective. We are in Afghanistan because we were attacked from Afghanistan, not because we want to try and -- and build a better society in Afghanistan. But doing things to improve governance, to improve development in Afghanistan, to the degree it contributes to our security mission and to the effectiveness of the Afghan government in the security arena, that's what we're going to do. AMANPOUR: A final question, do you think the way out is to strike a deal with the Taliban? GATES: I think that the -- I think that the way out is to improve the security situation in Afghanistan to the point -- and to degrade the Taliban to a degree where they are willing to consider reconciliation on the terms of the Afghan government -- detaching themselves from al Qaeda, agreeing that -- to under -- abide by the Afghan constitution, agreeing to put down their weapons. I think those are the -- those are the conditions that -- that need to -- reconciliation must take -- must be the end game here. But it must take place on the terms of the Afghan government. AMANPOUR: And you think that can happen in -- in a year? GATES: Well, we're not limited to a year. I think that it can happen in the time frame that we're looking at ahead. Again, July 2011 is not the end. It is the beginning of a transition. AMANPOUR: Secretary Gates, thank you so much for joining us. GATES: Thanks a lot. AMANPOUR: Thank you. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(UNKNOWN): Wikileaks, along with three major newspapers, haspublished 92,000 classified intelligence documents, the largest leak inhistory. GIBBS: There are names. There are operations. There's logistics. It poses a very real and potential threat. (UNKNOWN): I'm a combative person, so I wanted (inaudible)MULLEN: The truth is, they might already have on their hands theblood of some young soldier or that of an Afghan family. (END VIDEO CLIP)AMANPOUR: Highlights from the Wikileaks story that's really shakenup Washington and capitals around the world. We'll talk about that andmore on our roundtable with George Will, Democratic strategist DonnaBrazile, Paul Krugman of the New York Times, and in Madrid this morning,Ahmed Rashid, the Pakistani journalist who is the world authority on theTaliban. Thank you all for joining us this morning. Let me go to you first,George. What about this leak? How bad is it for the war effort? Andhow bad is it for a government which really has to reassess what it doeswith state secrets? WILL: Well, these were lethal without being helpful, lethal in thesense that they compromised both methods and, more important, sourcesthemselves. Not helping, in the sense that they're not a bit like thePentagon Papers, which showed in the Vietnam War that the governmentinternally had a very different understanding of what was going on inVietnam than it was saying publicly. That's not the case here. These are redundant anecdotes about whatwe all knew from good journalism and honest government about this. What we're left with now is still the question of the mission. Inyour interview with Secretary Gates, he said the following: ""We are inAfghanistan because we were attacked from Afghanistan."" Notice thepreposition. We weren't attacked by Afghanistan, in the sense that wewere attacked by Japan at Pearl Harbor. We were attacked from there. And National Security Adviser James Jones has said that we have tobe there because otherwise the terrorists would have more space to plotand train. AMANPOUR: Exactly. WILL: We were attacked from Hamburg, in a sense. You can plot inthis kind of war anywhere. AMANPOUR: Well, yes, but the real ground war is in Afghanistan. And let me go to Ahmed Rashid, who is the authority on the Taliban. Ahmed, what is your assessment of how Wikileaks and all the material andinformation that came out of that could affect the war? RASHID: Well, again, I don't think that there has been any reallymajor new information given in these Wikileaks. The impact has beenquite extraordinary in America, in Europe, and other places simplybecause this war has not really been properly followed by the public. The media has not followed it. And as a result, I think people arebeing quite shocked about the degree of detail and content that havecome out. But I don't think anything drastically new has come out. Nowthere is a risk of sources, et cetera, which the Taliban are going tofollow up on. AMANPOUR: Precisely. And I wanted to ask you about that. You knowalready they have said that they're going to be searching and scouringthis treasure trove. Do you -- do you foresee that there are going tobe bodies turning up in Afghanistan amongst people who've really beenhelping the United States? RASHID: Well, I hope that, you know, these -- a lot of these leaksare quite old, and people have moved on. A lot of the names may befalse names. I hope we're not going to see bodies, but certainly thisis something -- the Taliban are extremely good at following debates inthe West, the Western media, debates in parliaments in Europe, in theCongress. They will have seen this new vote just now, where so many ofthe Democrats seem to be voting against the war. They are expert now at following up. And if there are people to befollowed up upon, they will do so. AMANPOUR: Well, let me put that to Donna Brazile and to PaulKrugman. The idea that they are really smart, they read the Westernpress, they have a very highly sophisticated, whether we like to thinkthat or not, media operation. BRAZILE: Well, it put the Afghanistan war back on the front page,the longest war in United States' history. Voters are weary of this warright now. Congress is -- is worried about the funding, the strategy. I think this will give the administration an opportunity to onceagain talk about the mission, before December, when the president hasannounced that he intends to reassess what they're doing. I also think it raises a serious question about Pakistan'sinvolvement with the Taliban and also whether or not Mr. Karzai is stillup to the job of bringing the government together, reinforcing thepolice and the army. It raises a serious question about going forwardand the timetable. KRUGMAN: You know, when I look at this, people say, you know, wecan't abandon Afghanistan, all that. I'm surprised that people aren'tpointing out that basically the decision to abandon Afghanistan wastaken eight years ago, right? Eight years ago, when the Taliban was onthe run, when it might have been possible to really use the momentum tochange this, that's when the Bush administration pulled the troops outof Afghanistan, pulled the resources away, because they wanted to invadeIraq instead. And now you're asking us to -- you're asking Obama to recover from asituation where we've spent eight years losing credibility. AMANPOUR: But the thing is, he is trying to recover. He's had thisbig strategy. He's made a surge in Afghanistan. And right now, forinstance, Bill Kristol of the Weekly Standard has written a memo toPresident Obama, basically saying rescind the 2011 -- the 2011deadline. What do you think has to happen to make this war winnable forthe United States? WILL: Well, first of all, in his remarks to you, Secretary Gatessemi-rescinded it, by saying that, in fact, what comes in July '11 --2011 is fairly limited numbers of withdrawal. That's making it a fairlyelastic deadline. But look what -- and our friend in Madrid can comment on this. Secretary Gates said to you today, our purpose is to degrade the Talibanto a degree where they are willing to consider reconciliation on theterms of the Afghan government. Now, that, A, sounds like surrender,and, B, the normal Afghan would say, ""Give me a third choice, because Idon't like the Afghan government, either."" AMANPOUR: Right. Ahmed Rashid, how did you read that, that theTaliban is expected to surrender or come into a reconciliation on theterms of the Karzai government? RASHID: Well, I think this is going to be the very big debate thattakes place within the Obama administration come December, when thepolicy review takes place, because the other position to this is that,in fact, the U.S. should start talks with the Taliban as soon aspossible, and that will then trigger up much better attempts to try andbring about a regional cohesion, a regional alliance to support those talks. The Taliban, with all their interlocutors that they've been talkingto so far, have made it clear that they want to talk to the Americansdirectly. Now, any such talks can't be based on conditions set byAmerica, as Gates has just done. They would have to be free and opentalks, and they would have to continue for some time. So I think once you have a dialogue going with the Taliban, thenyou, I think, can go to the Pakistanis and the ISI and tell them, ""Now,look, we're talking to the Taliban. This is the end game now. Thesurges will continue. Talks will continue. But you now have to give adeadline for the end of these safe havens for the Taliban leaders."" In other words, the Taliban leaders should know that their safehavens will only have a limited timeframe and negotiations will alsohave a limited timeframe. AMANPOUR: Well, lots and lots to talk about on this particularissue, but let's move on a little bit. I actually asked Speaker NancyPelosi about Afghanistan, about the war vote, the war funding vote inthe House, and whether she thought that the president needed to come outand speak more to the country about Afghanistan. This is what she saidto me. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PELOSI: They're worried about their economic security, and that'swhat they want to hear from the president, is how we can increase --create jobs in our country as we reduce the deficit. (END VIDEO CLIP)AMANPOUR: So there you have it. Economic security, obviously, isthe number-one preoccupation, as it always would be wherever there isthese huge problems of unemployment. There is a huge debate right now,all leading economists basically disagree on how and what effectstimulus has had, what it means for future economic policy. Is itdeficit reduction austerity? Is it more stimulus? Where do we go andwhat does it mean to people? KRUGMAN: Well, what it means to people, I think, is a lot ofconfusion, which is -- which is a problem, right? They're not hearingany clear message. You know, the way I look at it is that there are two sides in thisdebate -- I call them inflationistas and deflationistas -- that were --one side, the inflationistas, have said, ""Oh, god, we have this -- wehave budget deficits. The Fed is printing money. We're going to haveinflation. Interest rates are going to go sky-high."" The deflationistas have said, you know, that we've had a majorfinancial crisis. In the fact of that, the Obama stimulus plan is toosmall, interest rates are going to stay low because nobody wants tospend, the -- you know, that the risk is deflation. So far, the deflationistas have been totally right. What'sinteresting is that the political debate is being dominated by thepeople who've been wrong about everything up to this point, who said,well, you know, actually, interest rates are lower. They just hit a --more than a year low just now. But they keep on saying, oh, but it's any day now. We've got to beafraid of those people who aren't visible in the markets and so on. But this is a -- there is this problem that people have got thisausterity notion in their mind, not based on anything that's actuallyhappening, but based upon this hypothetical notion and because itappeals to people who just feel that there has to be some reason to makepeople suffer even more. AMANPOUR: Let me put up this graphic, talking about the grossdomestic product of the second quarter. Growth is happening, but at 2.4percent, which is slower than most people wanted. I see you shakingyour head in this debate. The Financial Times is basically saying thatthe deficit talk is a phony, rhetorical war and that actually stimulushas had some effect. You're shaking your head. WILL: Well, the recovery is now more than a year old, and we knowtwo things about it. It's unusually weak for a recovery after a severedownturn, and, B, starting weak, it's getting weaker, for two reasons. First of all, the stimulus is running out. Paul's right aboutthis. Cash for Clunkers has come and gone. The homebuyer's tax creditfor purchasing new -- particularly new homes, come and gone. Second, the growth so far has been largely driven by inventories,businesses rebuilding their inventories in anticipation of the consumer-- 70 percent of business activity in a normal time -- coming back tothe malls. The trouble is, the consumer in his native perversity hasbegun to save. The savings rate is now 6.2 percent. So what you have is what I think Keynes called the paradox of thrift. KRUGMAN: Exactly. WILL: It's a virtue until it isn't a virtue. BRAZILE: Well, I'm not the resident economist on the panel,clearly, but what's happening, Christiane, is that we're not creatingjobs. The economy is -- is -- is not creating enough jobs. Unemployment remains high. The Democrats will have to campaign on thepromise that the policies that they've put forward thus far has avertedthe Great Depression 2.0. And going forward, this is a choice between going back to the past,going back to Bush-onomics, or going forward with a path toward economicgrowth, which brings us back to the Bush tax cuts and -- and whether ornot the -- the Congress will -- will just let them expire in January orlet some of them stay on the table. AMANPOUR: Well, you heard what I asked Speaker Pelosi, and she saidshe hoped that this would come to a resolution before the -- before themidterms. Is that likely? BRAZILE: Well, I don't think so. I mean, look, Congress on theHouse side, they're away for six weeks. They're going out. They'regoing to campaign on what they've accomplished. But I think when they return, they're going to have to turn backtoward the budget, turn toward the economy, and once again convince thevoters out there that they've done something to provide economic growthfor the future. KRUGMAN: Just wanted to say, George, it's exactly what I would havedone in describing it. The forces for growth are fading out. We're notlooking good going forward. This is very difficult. It's very hard foran administration in power to run on the campaign slogan, ""It could havebeen worse,"" and that is essentially -- and it's true. It actuallycould have been a lot worse, but -- but that doesn't sell very well. AMANPOUR: Can I... WILL: Lest it be thought that Paul and I agree on something, let me... AMANPOUR: Well, you might. Maybe this is a rarity today. WILL: No, this is not the case, because Paul thinks the governmentis dangerously frugal at this point, and I do not think so. I side withpeople like Kenneth Rogoff at Harvard who say there is time forausterity, and this is it. KRUGMAN: Well, you know, we can... AMANPOUR: That's happening in Europe, as you know... (CROSSTALK)KRUGMAN: That's -- yes, I think Ken Rogoff is doing some damagehere with some pretty bad statistics. But... AMANPOUR: Can I -- can I move over to Madrid again and ask Ahmedabout this economy, because it obviously clearly impacts what'shappening in -- in America's foreign policy, as well. What do people inPakistan, who've been promised so much aid by the United States -- doesthis even figure in their debates when they look at the U.S., the factthat the money is shorter? RASHID: Oh, it does very much. I mean, I think really people arefully aware that the continuation of the American presence inAfghanistan and the aid to Pakistan is dependent, is hostage, if youlike, to whether the American economy picks up or not, especially in theautumn, when the surge will be completed, the troop surge will becompleted, a very critical moment will appear when Obama has to decidewhat his next six-months, one-year policy is going to be in the policyreview. And all of this probably is going to be dominated by how effectiveor uneffective the American economy is doing. I mean, we've seen thevote in Congress now. I mean, what happens in three months' time if thevote in Congress is even more lopsided and more Democrats turn againstthe war? AMANPOUR: That is indeed a big question. Let us move on, though,right now -- and I want to move on to something else that the Democratsmade a huge, big deal about when they came in, and that was to have anethical Congress, to have a -- you know, drain the swamp, as many peoplesaid. This is what President Obama said just in the last couple of daysover the travails of Representative Charlie Rangel. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: I think Charlie Rangel served a very long time and servedhis constituents very well, but these allegations are very troubling. And, you know, he's somebody who's at the end of his career, 80 yearsold. I'm sure that what he wants is to be able to end his career withdignity, and my hope is, is that happens. (END VIDEO CLIP)BRAZILE: It would be politically expedient for Mr. Rangel to juststep down and resign, but he's not the kind of lawmaker that would dothat. These are serious allegations, and Mr. Rangel would like to havehis day up on the Hill to defend himself, defend his honor, and answerto some of these charges. Again, it's easy to drain the swamp if you have some type of Drano,but it's clogged up, and I think Mr. Rangel and others would like tohave their day to clear their names. AMANPOUR: What about the president making that pretty... KRUGMAN: Yes, well, they... AMANPOUR: ... dismissive statement? KRUGMAN: No, I think it's fair enough. But, you know, let me ask-- there's something I don't understand about this whole thing. Thereare actually two major investigations of members of Congress underwayright now. There's Charlie Rangel, who's accused of some fairly petty,although stupid and wrong, ethical violations, and there's Senator JohnEnsign, who's facing a criminal investigation and which actually -- it'seven a story that involves sex. And you get no publicity whatsoever onthe Ensign investigation. Why is Rangel getting all this attention? AMANPOUR: Is that fair, George? WILL: Well, Rangel is much more important, because he's chairman ofan important committee. And in fact, Rangel's misfortune is a nationalmisfortune, because we desperately need -- and after the deficitcommission reports in December, we might have had -- serious tax reformin this country. That requires a cooperative member leading thatcommittee in the House. (CROSSTALK)KRUGMAN: Nothing's -- nothing's going to happen. (END VIDEO CLIP)KRUGMAN: If there's actually anything to come out of the deficitcommission, it would matter, but it's not. WILL: ... as Rostenkowski was with Ronald Reagan's tax reform. Now, Rangel has a weak position, but a very -- a weak case, but a strongposition. His strong position is the president and everyone wants thisthing over with so the Democrats won't be tarred with this, andtherefore he can hold out for some minor reprimand -- indeed, areprimand, technically -- just to liquidate this and get out of here. KRUGMAN: In a way, he's sort of the Hamid Karzai of the U.S. Congress. AMANPOUR: Well, I was going to -- we only have 15 seconds left, butI was going to ask Ahmed Rashid what they make of all of this, given somuch corruption charges over there. Ahmed, we're out of time, but thankyou all so much for joining us. And the roundtable continues in the green room on abcnews.com, wherelater you can also find our fact checks. We've teamed up withPolitiFact to check the show. You can also follow me on Facebook andTwitter. AMANPOUR: Madam Speaker, thank you so much for joining me. AMANPOUR: Can I ask you about some of the important news that's been made this week, particularly in -- in the House and that would be on Afghanistan. Last year, 32 Democrats voted against the funding of the war in Afghanistan. This year, 102 Democrats voted against. That seems to be a dramatic rejection from the president's own party of his major strategic goal. Our president came in. He was president maybe two months, three months, by the time we took the vote last year. And the Republicans said they weren't going to vote for the funding. And so it took all Democratic votes. I persuaded my members to give this president a chance, to give him room in order to have time to implement his plan. And in -- and in the course of time -- now the Republicans said they would vote for it, it gave my members the freedom to express themselves on the war in Afghanistan. AMANPOUR: I know the speaker doesn't have to vote. AMANPOUR: But how would you have voted? PELOSI: Well, we brought the bill to the floor. And that was a statement that said that we knew that our troops needed to have what was -- what they needed to have would be provided for them. So we will never abandon our men and women in uniform. On the other hand, it gave our members a chance to express their view. PELOSI: Well, again, we have a -- varying degrees of expression here. We are there, we've taken an oath to defend the constitution and therefore the American people. And that's what people will be looking at -- how does this figure into our protecting the American people? AMANPOUR: Well, is it worth it? AMANPOUR: Is it worth it? PELOSI: That's the question. AMANPOUR: But that's my question to you. PELOSI: Well, we will -- as I said, we will see the metrics as they unfold in the next few months and certainly by the end of this year. AMANPOUR: But what does your gut tell you? PELOSI: in my visits to afghanistan, the last time i was there was over mother's day weekend to visit the troops///and the four metrics that we have always used year in and year out on these visits have been about security. And the military tells us this cannot be won militarily solely. Secondly, governance and ending corruption..... AMANPOUR: I'm just trying to figure out, for instance, you know, what you think is the right thing to do in Afghanistan at the moment. Look, ""Time"" magazine, this week, has this as its cover -- a girl whose had her nose and ears cut off by the Taliban. You know, to put it right down to its basics, is America going to abandon the women of Afghanistan, the people of Afghanistan again? PELOSI: Well, first of all, we're in Afghanistan because it's in our strategic national interests to be so for our own national security, to stop terrorism, to increase global security. The women of Afghanistan have been a priority for many of the women in Congress -- and men, too, but the women have taken a special interest. When I was there in -- around Mother's Day, I went to a province in Southern Afghanistan and visited with women. And we talked about the education of their children, the health of women and the rest. And they -- especially their daughters.- they said we want that, but that can't happen without security. And these women in this remote province told us and that can't happen without the end of corruption. BIDEN SOT---""it could be as few as a couple thousand troops it could be more. Does that square with -- with what you think, that it could just be a couple of thousand troops? PELOSI: Well, I hope it is more than that. I know it's not going to be turn out the lights and let's all go home on one day. But I do think the American people expect it to be somewhere between that and a -- a few thousand troops. AMANPOUR: Let's go to something much closer to home right now at the moment and that is the ethics conundrum with Representative Rangel. How does your affection and your respect for him as a colleague square with what's going on right now and what you said and declared, that this is going to be the -- the -- the most ethical Congress ---- that you're going to drain the swamp of any kind of wrongdoing and corruption, etc.? PELOSI: When I came in, I said we're draining the swamp. And we did. We have passed the most sweeping ethics reform in the history of the Congress. Any personal respect and affection we may have for people makes us sad about the course of events, but we have to pull the high ethical standard and none of our personalities is more important than that. AMANPOUR: Can you see Congressman Rangel ever returning as chairman of the Ways and Means or in any position of leadership in -- in the House? AMANPOUR: No matter what happens? PELOSI: it's an elementary discussion, because what we have done is to wait and see what the Committee decides. I respect what they do. I'm totally out of the loop. It is independent. It is confidential, classified, secret, whatever. We don't know what it is. But we do respect the work that the members of the Committee do. AMANPOUR: Let me ask you about the mid-term elections. You are, by all accounts, one of the most -- if not the most -- powerful and successful speakers of -- in the history of the United States. You've passed so much legislation. The president was elected with a significant majority. You had control of both houses of Congress. And yet now, people are talking about you might lose your majority in the House. The gap seems to be growing wider between what's achieved and what's making an impact with the people. How did this happen? PELOSI: Well, that's one version of the story. from outsiders perspective.... AMANPOUR: ... how did you get to this place where, perhaps, you might lose your majority? PELOSI: We don't see it that way. We are very proud of the agenda that we have put forth to the American people. our recovery package, as the economists have said, we've had twice as many people unemployed as there are now if we had not moved forward. These actions are all controversial because we were digging our way out of a deep ditch. so we've been legislating for the past 18 months. The other side has been in campaign mode for 18 months, saying no, stopping job creation and the rest. But our members are the best salespersons for their own districts. They've been elected there. They know their constituents. AMANPOUR: Are you nervous about November? AMANPOUR: Not at all? PELOSI: No. PELOSI: -- that's not. AMANPOUR: -- going into an election. But people say there's been considerable worry about what will happen in November. PELOSI: Well, let me say this. I never take anything for granted. And our agenda now is we're not going forward -- we're not going back to the failed policies of the Bush administration. We're going forward. AMANPOUR: So what does it make you feel, then, when the president's own spokesman said that you might lose the majority? PELOSI: -- with all due respect -- I don't spend a whole lot of time thinking about what the president's employees say about one thing or another. PELOSI: Well, the -- they must realize that. But you know what, I'm speaker of the House. I have a great chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Chris Van Hollen. We have a solid plan of messaging and mobilize -- mobilizing at the grassroots level and management of our campaigns. So we feel very confident about where we are, whether that's well known to that gentleman or not. AMANPOUR: Let me ask you about the tax cuts. Are you going to take that issue to -- to a fight before the elections, letting the tax cuts for the -- for the two -- 250,000 expire and then keep them on for the middle class? PELOSI: Well, the -- the tax cuts for the wealthiest -- of the $250,000 and above -- were the -- the Bush initiative. I dont see any reason why we should renew a tax cut that only gives a tax cut to the wealthiest people in America, increases the deficit and doesn't create jobs. That doesn't make any sense. PELOSI: It would be my hope. But let me just say, on The Recovery Act, nearly $300 billion of The Recovery Act were tax cuts for the middle class. The Republicans want to have the tax cut and they want it unpaid for -- $700 billion added to the deficit for an initiative that does not create jobs. AMANPOUR: Can I show you something? AMANPOUR: there's so much polarization, so much partisanship, so much -- not just amongst the politicians, but in the press, amongst the people. You talked a little bit about what, you know, us and them, in your view. I want to show you this, which is a Republican commercial. AMANPOUR: Oh, you haven't seen it? AMANPOUR: -- you being the -- the bogeyman? PELOSI: Well,-- what I know about that is that they tried this. This is their campaign in Pennsylvania 12, the 12th Congressional District of Pennsylvania. Their whole campaign was an attack on the president and on -- on Pelosi. PELOSI: ...... and I said to to the president i think they may have gotten more focus here than you for this one time. And they fully expected to win the race and we won by 8.5 points. Because this is funny, it attracts attention, but they have nothing to say about what they want to go for, what they want to do is privatize Social Security. AMANPOUR: -- for me, looking in from outside, it just seems -- that's seems to be a never-ending partisanship. What is it you can do for the people in this highly polarized situation. PELOSI well first of all, what you define as, you describe as a highly polarized situation is a very big difference of opinion. The Republicans are here for the special interests, we're here for the people's interests. The president said we will measure our progress, our success, by the progress that is made by America's working families. That is our priority. That is not their priority. This isn't about inter-party bickering. This is about a major philosophical difference as to whose side you're on. You don't like to think that. We come here to find our common ground. That's our responsibility. But if we can't find it, we still have to move. I've never voted for a perfect bill in my life. I don't think anyone hasI wish it were not so stark. I wish the elections weren't so necessary for us to win. I really do, because it should be -- there should be more common ground. Are we unhappy that our not -- the -- the job creation has not gone as fast as we would like? Well, we were digging out of a very deep hole. But we will continue to fight. AMANPOUR: Speaker Pelosi, thank you very much, indeed, for joining us. PELOSI: Well, I look forward to welcoming you back soon again. And congratulations to you and much success. AMANPOUR: Secretary Gates, thank you very much for joining us and welcome to ""This Week"". AMANPOUR: Let's start with WikiLeaks. How can an ordinary soldier sitting at his computer, apparently listening to Lady Gaga or whatever, spew all this stuff out with nobody knowing? GATES: It's -- it's an -- it's an interesting question, because had -- had he tried to do this or had whoever did this tried to do it at a -- a rear headquarters, overseas or in pretty much anywhere here in the U.S., we have controls in place that would have allowed us to detect it. But one of the changes that has happened as we have fought these wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has been an effort to put the -- put as much information and intelligence as far forward to the soldiers as we possibly can, so that at a forward operating base, they -- they know what the security risks are to them and they -- and they also have information to help them accomplish their mission. So -- so we put an enormous amount of information out at a -- at the secret level and push it the furthest forward possible. And so it is this -- it -- it was much easier to do in theater and in Afghanistan or Iraq than it would have been at a rear headquarters or here in the U.S. AMANPOUR: So do you now have to reassess that -- much less intelligence going to the forward bases? GATES: I think we have to look at it, although I must say, my bias is that if one or a few members of the military did this, the notion that we would handicap our soldiers on the front lines by denying them information in an effort to try and prevent this from happening -- my bias is against that. I want those kids out there to have all the information they can have. And so we're going to look at are there ways in which we can mitigate the risk, but without denying the forward soldiers the information. AMANPOUR: How angry were you -- beyond the fact that classified information is out there -- the substance of it? GATES: Well, I'm not sure anger is the right word. I just -- I think mortified, appalled. And -- and if -- if I'm angry, it is -- it is because I believe that this information puts those in Afghanistan who have helped us at risk. It puts our soldiers at risk because they can learn a lot -- our adversaries can learn a lot about our techniques, tactics and procedures from the body of these leaked documents. And so I think that's what puts our soldiers at risk. And -- and then, as I say, our sources. And, you know, growing up in the intelligence business, protecting your sources is sacrosanct. And -- and there was no sense of responsibility or accountability associated with it. AMANPOUR: You know, you talk about putting your sources at risk, a Taliban spokesman has told a British news organization that they are, indeed, going to go after any of those names that they find in this treasure trove of documents and they will, as they say, they know how to deal with people. I mean Admiral Mullen said that this leak basically has blood on its hands? GATES: Well, I mean given the Taliban's statement, I think it -- it basically proves the point. And my attitude on this is that there are two -- two areas of culpability. One is legal culpability. And that's up to the Justice Department and others. That's not my arena. But there's also a moral culpability. And that's where I think the verdict is guilty on WikiLeaks. They have put this out without any regard whatsoever for the consequences. AMANPOUR: So let me ask you about a couple of things that came out. One is the possibility that the Taliban may have Stinger missiles. Do they, do you think? GATES: I don't think so. GATES: I don't think so. AMANPOUR: The other is about Pakistan. Again raising the notion that Pakistan, no matter how much you say they're, you know, moving in your direction, helping with this fight against the Taliban and against al Qaeda, that they still are hedging their bets, that elements in Pakistan continue to hedge their bets or out and out support the Taliban and what they're doing in Afghanistan. How much of a problem is that for you? GATES: Well, it -- it is a concern, there's no question about it. But -- but I would say that, again, we walked out on Pakistan and Afghanistan in 1989 and left them basically holding the bag. And -- and there is always the fear that we will do that again. And I believe that's the reason there's a certain hedge. But what I see is a change in the strategic calculus in Pakistan. As they see these groups attacking Pakistan itself, where they are more and more partnering with us and working with us and fighting these insurgents and 140,000 soldiers in Northwestern Pakistan fighting some of the same insurgents we are. AMANPOUR: Right. But they're basically fighting the insurgents that are threatening them. They haven't gone into, for instance, these safe havens which still exist, Northern Waziristan. And General Jones, the national security adviser, has told ""The Washington Post"" that these safe havens are a big question mark in terms of our success rate. So unless they do that, cut off those safe havens, will you succeed in Afghanistan? GATES: -- we clearly would like for them to go after the safe havens. But they have gone after the safe haven -- some of the safe havens, in South Waziristan and Swat and elsewhere, places where, 18 months ago, I wouldn't have believed the Pakistanis would be actively engaged -- and militarily. And so the Pakistanis going after any of these groups, I believe, overall, helps us in what we're trying to accomplish, both with respect to Afghanistan and with respect to al Qaeda. AMANPOUR: But given the way the war is going right now and given the fact that the Taliban are very wily and very adaptable enemies and they do have a place where they can go across the border and hide, can you afford to wait for the Pakistanis to -- to move on into Northern Waziristan? GATES: I think that the -- first of all, we are increasing our cooperation with the Pakistanis in terms of working on both sides of the border, in terms of trying to prevent people from crossing that border. We are increasing our forces in Eastern Afghanistan that will help us do this. So I think that -- I think we're moving in the right direction here. AMANPOUR: But you don't have an open-ended period of time. The president has clearly said that the summer of 2011 is a period of transition. And many people are interpreting that in all sorts of different ways, as you know. The Taliban is clearly running out the clock -- it's trying to run out the clock. Let me put something up that David Kilcullen, the counter-insurgency expert, a former adviser to General Petraeus, said about the timetable. DAVID KILCULLEN: They believe that we had stated a date certain, that we were going to leave in the summer of 2011. And they immediately went out and spoke to the population and said, the Americans are leaving in 18 months, as it was then. What are you doing on the 19th month? Who are you backing? Because we'll still be there and they won't be. AMANPOUR: So that question is out there. So many people are arranging their schedules for 2011 -- the summer of 2011. But my question to you is this, what can General Petraeus do to defeat the Taliban at their own game? What can he do now in Afghanistan to avoid this deadline that they're setting for themselves? GATES: Well, first of all, I think we need to re-emphasize the message that we are not leaving Afghanistan in July of 2011. We are beginning a transition process and a thinning of our ranks that will -- and the pace will depend on the conditions on the ground. The president has been very clear about that. And if the Taliban are waiting for the nineteenth month, I welcome that, because we will be there in the nineteenth month and we will be there with a lot of troops. AMANPOUR: But what is a lot of troops? GATES: Well, first of all, I think that -- my personal opinion is that -- that drawdowns early on will be of fairly limited numbers. And as we are successful, we'll probably accelerate. But, again, it's -- it will depend on the conditions on the ground. AMANPOUR: Is there any way now -- between now and December, between now and next -- next summer, to deliver some high profile, real reconstruction, real sort of progress to them to make everybody know that you're serious and to change the dynamic? GATES: Well, first of all, I think we're already seeing that. We're already seeing it in Central Helmand, where security development and governance, economic returning. We are seeing it in places like Nad Ali. We're actually seeing it in places like Marjah, that has been slower and tougher than we anticipated, but it's getting better every day. And we're seeing it in gradually improving security in the area around Kandahar. It's going to take some time. It's going to be tough. We're going to take casualties. We have warned about this for months, that this summer would be very difficult for us. But I think there are tangible signs that this approach is working, this strategy is working. But the key thing to remember is the full surge isn't even all I Afghanistan yet and will not be until the end of August. So this surge over the last few months is only beginning to take effect. AMANPOUR: What I think a lot of people maybe don't get is that the Afghan people still want the American forces there. In the latest ABC poll, it shows that 68 percent of the Afghan people actually want the American forces still there. Do you think that there has been an opportunity missed or should there be an opportunity seized by yourself, maybe by the president, to go out and speak to the American people more about -- about Afghanistan, about the strategy, about why it's important? GATES: Well, first of all, I'm here. And I think the president has been out and has spoken about this. He talked about it in some detail at the time he nominated General Petraeus, about where we were headed. Probably we can do more. But Secretary Clinton and I and the president and the vice president and General Jones have all been out and -- and talking about this. And -- and I think -- you know, frankly, one of the things that I find frustrating is that I think that the president's strategy is really quite clear. I hear -- I hear all the stories that say what's the strategy, what's the goal here? I think it's quite clear. It's to -- it's to reverse the momentum of the Taliban, deny them control of populated areas, degrade their capabilities at the same time we're building up the Afghan security forces, so that the Afghan security forces can deny the Taliban and al Qaeda a base from which to attack the United States and the West. GATES: It's pretty straightforward. AMANPOUR: OK. Then let me -- since you brought that up, I want to bring up what Vice President Biden told NBC earlier this week about the strategy and about -- about the aims, because, again, I think the American people and many people are confused about what is the -- what is winning, what is the strategy right now? JOSEPH BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are in Afghanistan for one express purpose -- al Qaeda. The threat to the United States -- al Qaeda that exists in those mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan. We are not there to nation-build. AMANPOUR: Is that it? AMANPOUR: Is that the war? GATES: I agree with that. We are not there to -- to take on a nationwide reconstruction or construction project in Afghanistan. What we have to do is focus our efforts on those civilian aspects and governance to help us accomplish our se -- our security objective. We are in Afghanistan because we were attacked from Afghanistan, not because we want to try and -- and build a better society in Afghanistan. But doing things to improve governance, to improve development in Afghanistan, to the degree it contributes to our security mission and to the effectiveness of the Afghan government in the security arena, that's what we're going to do. AMANPOUR: A final question, do you think the way out is to strike a deal with the Taliban? GATES: I think that the -- I think that the way out is to improve the security situation in Afghanistan to the point -- and to degrade the Taliban to a degree where they are willing to consider reconciliation on the terms of the Afghan government -- detaching themselves from al Qaeda, agreeing that -- to under -- abide by the Afghan constitution, agreeing to put down their weapons. I think those are the -- those are the conditions that -- that need to -- reconciliation must take -- must be the end game here. But it must take place on the terms of the Afghan government. AMANPOUR: And you think that can happen in -- in a year? GATES: Well, we're not limited to a year. I think that it can happen in the time frame that we're looking at ahead. Again, July 2011 is not the end. It is the beginning of a transition. AMANPOUR: Secretary Gates, thank you so much for joining us. (UNKNOWN): Wikileaks, along with three major newspapers, haspublished 92,000 classified intelligence documents, the largest leak inhistory. GIBBS: There are names. There are operations. There's logistics. It poses a very real and potential threat. MULLEN: The truth is, they might already have on their hands theblood of some young soldier or that of an Afghan family. AMANPOUR: Highlights from the Wikileaks story that's really shakenup Washington and capitals around the world. We'll talk about that andmore on our roundtable with George Will, Democratic strategist DonnaBrazile, Paul Krugman of the New York Times, and in Madrid this morning,Ahmed Rashid, the Pakistani journalist who is the world authority on theTaliban. Thank you all for joining us this morning. Let me go to you first,George. What about this leak? How bad is it for the war effort? Andhow bad is it for a government which really has to reassess what it doeswith state secrets? WILL: Well, these were lethal without being helpful, lethal in thesense that they compromised both methods and, more important, sourcesthemselves. Not helping, in the sense that they're not a bit like thePentagon Papers, which showed in the Vietnam War that the governmentinternally had a very different understanding of what was going on inVietnam than it was saying publicly. That's not the case here. These are redundant anecdotes about whatwe all knew from good journalism and honest government about this. What we're left with now is still the question of the mission. Inyour interview with Secretary Gates, he said the following: ""We are inAfghanistan because we were attacked from Afghanistan."" Notice thepreposition. We weren't attacked by Afghanistan, in the sense that wewere attacked by Japan at Pearl Harbor. We were attacked from there. And National Security Adviser James Jones has said that we have tobe there because otherwise the terrorists would have more space to plotand train. WILL: We were attacked from Hamburg, in a sense. You can plot inthis kind of war anywhere. AMANPOUR: Well, yes, but the real ground war is in Afghanistan. And let me go to Ahmed Rashid, who is the authority on the Taliban. Ahmed, what is your assessment of how Wikileaks and all the material andinformation that came out of that could affect the war? RASHID: Well, again, I don't think that there has been any reallymajor new information given in these Wikileaks. The impact has beenquite extraordinary in America, in Europe, and other places simplybecause this war has not really been properly followed by the public. The media has not followed it. And as a result, I think people arebeing quite shocked about the degree of detail and content that havecome out. But I don't think anything drastically new has come out. Nowthere is a risk of sources, et cetera, which the Taliban are going tofollow up on. AMANPOUR: Precisely. And I wanted to ask you about that. You knowalready they have said that they're going to be searching and scouringthis treasure trove. Do you -- do you foresee that there are going tobe bodies turning up in Afghanistan amongst people who've really beenhelping the United States? RASHID: Well, I hope that, you know, these -- a lot of these leaksare quite old, and people have moved on. A lot of the names may befalse names. I hope we're not going to see bodies, but certainly thisis something -- the Taliban are extremely good at following debates inthe West, the Western media, debates in parliaments in Europe, in theCongress. They will have seen this new vote just now, where so many ofthe Democrats seem to be voting against the war. They are expert now at following up. And if there are people to befollowed up upon, they will do so. AMANPOUR: Well, let me put that to Donna Brazile and to PaulKrugman. The idea that they are really smart, they read the Westernpress, they have a very highly sophisticated, whether we like to thinkthat or not, media operation. BRAZILE: Well, it put the Afghanistan war back on the front page,the longest war in United States' history. Voters are weary of this warright now. Congress is -- is worried about the funding, the strategy. I think this will give the administration an opportunity to onceagain talk about the mission, before December, when the president hasannounced that he intends to reassess what they're doing. I also think it raises a serious question about Pakistan'sinvolvement with the Taliban and also whether or not Mr. Karzai is stillup to the job of bringing the government together, reinforcing thepolice and the army. It raises a serious question about going forwardand the timetable. KRUGMAN: You know, when I look at this, people say, you know, wecan't abandon Afghanistan, all that. I'm surprised that people aren'tpointing out that basically the decision to abandon Afghanistan wastaken eight years ago, right? Eight years ago, when the Taliban was onthe run, when it might have been possible to really use the momentum tochange this, that's when the Bush administration pulled the troops outof Afghanistan, pulled the resources away, because they wanted to invadeIraq instead. And now you're asking us to -- you're asking Obama to recover from asituation where we've spent eight years losing credibility. AMANPOUR: But the thing is, he is trying to recover. He's had thisbig strategy. He's made a surge in Afghanistan. And right now, forinstance, Bill Kristol of the Weekly Standard has written a memo toPresident Obama, basically saying rescind the 2011 -- the 2011deadline. What do you think has to happen to make this war winnable forthe United States? WILL: Well, first of all, in his remarks to you, Secretary Gatessemi-rescinded it, by saying that, in fact, what comes in July '11 --2011 is fairly limited numbers of withdrawal. That's making it a fairlyelastic deadline. But look what -- and our friend in Madrid can comment on this. Secretary Gates said to you today, our purpose is to degrade the Talibanto a degree where they are willing to consider reconciliation on theterms of the Afghan government. Now, that, A, sounds like surrender,and, B, the normal Afghan would say, ""Give me a third choice, because Idon't like the Afghan government, either."" AMANPOUR: Right. Ahmed Rashid, how did you read that, that theTaliban is expected to surrender or come into a reconciliation on theterms of the Karzai government? RASHID: Well, I think this is going to be the very big debate thattakes place within the Obama administration come December, when thepolicy review takes place, because the other position to this is that,in fact, the U.S. should start talks with the Taliban as soon aspossible, and that will then trigger up much better attempts to try andbring about a regional cohesion, a regional alliance to support those talks. The Taliban, with all their interlocutors that they've been talkingto so far, have made it clear that they want to talk to the Americansdirectly. Now, any such talks can't be based on conditions set byAmerica, as Gates has just done. They would have to be free and opentalks, and they would have to continue for some time. So I think once you have a dialogue going with the Taliban, thenyou, I think, can go to the Pakistanis and the ISI and tell them, ""Now,look, we're talking to the Taliban. This is the end game now. Thesurges will continue. Talks will continue. But you now have to give adeadline for the end of these safe havens for the Taliban leaders."" In other words, the Taliban leaders should know that their safehavens will only have a limited timeframe and negotiations will alsohave a limited timeframe. AMANPOUR: Well, lots and lots to talk about on this particularissue, but let's move on a little bit. I actually asked Speaker NancyPelosi about Afghanistan, about the war vote, the war funding vote inthe House, and whether she thought that the president needed to come outand speak more to the country about Afghanistan. This is what she saidto me. Listen. PELOSI: They're worried about their economic security, and that'swhat they want to hear from the president, is how we can increase --create jobs in our country as we reduce the deficit. AMANPOUR: So there you have it. Economic security, obviously, isthe number-one preoccupation, as it always would be wherever there isthese huge problems of unemployment. There is a huge debate right now,all leading economists basically disagree on how and what effectstimulus has had, what it means for future economic policy. Is itdeficit reduction austerity? Is it more stimulus? Where do we go andwhat does it mean to people? KRUGMAN: Well, what it means to people, I think, is a lot ofconfusion, which is -- which is a problem, right? They're not hearingany clear message. You know, the way I look at it is that there are two sides in thisdebate -- I call them inflationistas and deflationistas -- that were --one side, the inflationistas, have said, ""Oh, god, we have this -- wehave budget deficits. The Fed is printing money. We're going to haveinflation. Interest rates are going to go sky-high."" The deflationistas have said, you know, that we've had a majorfinancial crisis. In the fact of that, the Obama stimulus plan is toosmall, interest rates are going to stay low because nobody wants tospend, the -- you know, that the risk is deflation. So far, the deflationistas have been totally right. What'sinteresting is that the political debate is being dominated by thepeople who've been wrong about everything up to this point, who said,well, you know, actually, interest rates are lower. They just hit a --more than a year low just now. But they keep on saying, oh, but it's any day now. We've got to beafraid of those people who aren't visible in the markets and so on. But this is a -- there is this problem that people have got thisausterity notion in their mind, not based on anything that's actuallyhappening, but based upon this hypothetical notion and because itappeals to people who just feel that there has to be some reason to makepeople suffer even more. AMANPOUR: Let me put up this graphic, talking about the grossdomestic product of the second quarter. Growth is happening, but at 2.4percent, which is slower than most people wanted. I see you shakingyour head in this debate. The Financial Times is basically saying thatthe deficit talk is a phony, rhetorical war and that actually stimulushas had some effect. You're shaking your head. WILL: Well, the recovery is now more than a year old, and we knowtwo things about it. It's unusually weak for a recovery after a severedownturn, and, B, starting weak, it's getting weaker, for two reasons. First of all, the stimulus is running out. Paul's right aboutthis. Cash for Clunkers has come and gone. The homebuyer's tax creditfor purchasing new -- particularly new homes, come and gone. Second, the growth so far has been largely driven by inventories,businesses rebuilding their inventories in anticipation of the consumer-- 70 percent of business activity in a normal time -- coming back tothe malls. The trouble is, the consumer in his native perversity hasbegun to save. The savings rate is now 6.2 percent. So what you have is what I think Keynes called the paradox of thrift. WILL: It's a virtue until it isn't a virtue. BRAZILE: Well, I'm not the resident economist on the panel,clearly, but what's happening, Christiane, is that we're not creatingjobs. The economy is -- is -- is not creating enough jobs. Unemployment remains high. The Democrats will have to campaign on thepromise that the policies that they've put forward thus far has avertedthe Great Depression 2.0. And going forward, this is a choice between going back to the past,going back to Bush-onomics, or going forward with a path toward economicgrowth, which brings us back to the Bush tax cuts and -- and whether ornot the -- the Congress will -- will just let them expire in January orlet some of them stay on the table. AMANPOUR: Well, you heard what I asked Speaker Pelosi, and she saidshe hoped that this would come to a resolution before the -- before themidterms. Is that likely? BRAZILE: Well, I don't think so. I mean, look, Congress on theHouse side, they're away for six weeks. They're going out. They'regoing to campaign on what they've accomplished. But I think when they return, they're going to have to turn backtoward the budget, turn toward the economy, and once again convince thevoters out there that they've done something to provide economic growthfor the future. KRUGMAN: Just wanted to say, George, it's exactly what I would havedone in describing it. The forces for growth are fading out. We're notlooking good going forward. This is very difficult. It's very hard foran administration in power to run on the campaign slogan, ""It could havebeen worse,"" and that is essentially -- and it's true. It actuallycould have been a lot worse, but -- but that doesn't sell very well. WILL: Lest it be thought that Paul and I agree on something, let me... AMANPOUR: Well, you might. Maybe this is a rarity today. WILL: No, this is not the case, because Paul thinks the governmentis dangerously frugal at this point, and I do not think so. I side withpeople like Kenneth Rogoff at Harvard who say there is time forausterity, and this is it. KRUGMAN: Well, you know, we can... AMANPOUR: That's happening in Europe, as you know... KRUGMAN: That's -- yes, I think Ken Rogoff is doing some damagehere with some pretty bad statistics. But... AMANPOUR: Can I -- can I move over to Madrid again and ask Ahmedabout this economy, because it obviously clearly impacts what'shappening in -- in America's foreign policy, as well. What do people inPakistan, who've been promised so much aid by the United States -- doesthis even figure in their debates when they look at the U.S., the factthat the money is shorter? RASHID: Oh, it does very much. I mean, I think really people arefully aware that the continuation of the American presence inAfghanistan and the aid to Pakistan is dependent, is hostage, if youlike, to whether the American economy picks up or not, especially in theautumn, when the surge will be completed, the troop surge will becompleted, a very critical moment will appear when Obama has to decidewhat his next six-months, one-year policy is going to be in the policyreview. And all of this probably is going to be dominated by how effectiveor uneffective the American economy is doing. I mean, we've seen thevote in Congress now. I mean, what happens in three months' time if thevote in Congress is even more lopsided and more Democrats turn againstthe war? AMANPOUR: That is indeed a big question. Let us move on, though,right now -- and I want to move on to something else that the Democratsmade a huge, big deal about when they came in, and that was to have anethical Congress, to have a -- you know, drain the swamp, as many peoplesaid. This is what President Obama said just in the last couple of daysover the travails of Representative Charlie Rangel. OBAMA: I think Charlie Rangel served a very long time and servedhis constituents very well, but these allegations are very troubling. And, you know, he's somebody who's at the end of his career, 80 yearsold. I'm sure that what he wants is to be able to end his career withdignity, and my hope is, is that happens. BRAZILE: It would be politically expedient for Mr. Rangel to juststep down and resign, but he's not the kind of lawmaker that would dothat. These are serious allegations, and Mr. Rangel would like to havehis day up on the Hill to defend himself, defend his honor, and answerto some of these charges. Again, it's easy to drain the swamp if you have some type of Drano,but it's clogged up, and I think Mr. Rangel and others would like tohave their day to clear their names. AMANPOUR: What about the president making that pretty... KRUGMAN: Yes, well, they... AMANPOUR: ... dismissive statement? KRUGMAN: No, I think it's fair enough. But, you know, let me ask-- there's something I don't understand about this whole thing. Thereare actually two major investigations of members of Congress underwayright now. There's Charlie Rangel, who's accused of some fairly petty,although stupid and wrong, ethical violations, and there's Senator JohnEnsign, who's facing a criminal investigation and which actually -- it'seven a story that involves sex. And you get no publicity whatsoever onthe Ensign investigation. Why is Rangel getting all this attention? AMANPOUR: Is that fair, George? WILL: Well, Rangel is much more important, because he's chairman ofan important committee. And in fact, Rangel's misfortune is a nationalmisfortune, because we desperately need -- and after the deficitcommission reports in December, we might have had -- serious tax reformin this country. That requires a cooperative member leading thatcommittee in the House. KRUGMAN: Nothing's -- nothing's going to happen. KRUGMAN: If there's actually anything to come out of the deficitcommission, it would matter, but it's not. WILL: ... as Rostenkowski was with Ronald Reagan's tax reform. Now, Rangel has a weak position, but a very -- a weak case, but a strongposition. His strong position is the president and everyone wants thisthing over with so the Democrats won't be tarred with this, andtherefore he can hold out for some minor reprimand -- indeed, areprimand, technically -- just to liquidate this and get out of here. KRUGMAN: In a way, he's sort of the Hamid Karzai of the U.S. Congress. AMANPOUR: Well, I was going to -- we only have 15 seconds left, butI was going to ask Ahmed Rashid what they make of all of this, given somuch corruption charges over there. Ahmed, we're out of time, but thankyou all so much for joining us. And the roundtable continues in the green room on abcnews.com, wherelater you can also find our fact checks.

I put some highlights below. There is a lot of policy positions that we should give an extra scrub with Policy. In terms of what was opened to the press and what was not, the Washington Examiner got a hold of one of the private speech contracts (her speeches to universities were typically open press), so this is worth a read http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/clintons-speeches-are-cozy-for-wall-streeters-but-closed-to-journalists/article/2553294/section/author/dan-friedman *CLINTON ADMITS SHE IS OUT OF TOUCH* *Hillary Clinton: “I'm Kind Of Far Removed” From The Struggles Of The Middle Class “Because The Life I've Lived And The Economic, You Know, Fortunes That My Husband And I Now Enjoy.” *“And I am not taking a position on any policy, but I do think there is a growing sense of anxiety and even anger in the country over the feeling that the game is rigged. And I never had that feeling when I was growing up. Never. I mean, were there really rich people, of course there were. My father loved to complain about big business and big government, but we had a solid middle class upbringing. We had good public schools. We had accessible health care. We had our little, you know, one-family house that, you know, he saved up his money, didn't believe in mortgages. So I lived that. And now, obviously, I'm kind of far removed because the life I've lived and the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy, but I haven't forgotten it.” [Hillary Clinton Remarks at Goldman-Black Rock, 2/4/14] *CLINTON SAYS YOU NEED TO HAVE A PRIVATE AND PUBLIC POSITION ON POLICY* *Clinton: “But If Everybody's Watching, You Know, All Of The Back Room Discussions And The Deals, You Know, Then People Get A Little Nervous, To Say The Least. So, You Need Both A Public And A Private Position.”* CLINTON: You just have to sort of figure out how to -- getting back to that word, ""balance"" -- how to balance the public and the private efforts that are necessary to be successful, politically, and that's not just a comment about today. That, I think, has probably been true for all of our history, and if you saw the Spielberg movie, Lincoln, and how he was maneuvering and working to get the 13th Amendment passed, and he called one of my favorite predecessors, Secretary Seward, who had been the governor and senator from New York, ran against Lincoln for president, and he told Seward, I need your help to get this done. And Seward called some of his lobbyist friends who knew how to make a deal, and they just kept going at it. I mean, politics is like sausage being made. It is unsavory, and it always has been that way, but we usually end up where we need to be. But if everybody's watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position. And finally, I think -- I believe in evidence-based decision making. I want to know what the facts are. I mean, it's like when you guys go into some kind of a deal, you know, are you going to do that development or not, are you going to do that renovation or not, you know, you look at the numbers. You try to figure out what's going to work and what's not going to work. [Clinton Speech For National Multi-Housing Council, 4/24/13] *CLINTON TALKS ABOUT HOLDING WALL STREET ACCOUNTABLE ONLY FOR POLITICAL REASONS* *Clinton Said That The Blame Placed On The United States Banking System For The Crisis “Could Have Been Avoided In Terms Of Both Misunderstanding And Really Politicizing What Happened.”* “That was one of the reasons that I started traveling in February of '09, so people could, you know, literally yell at me for the United States and our banking system causing this everywhere. Now, that's an oversimplification we know, but it was the conventional wisdom. And I think that there's a lot that could have been avoided in terms of both misunderstanding and really politicizing what happened with greater transparency, with greater openness on all sides, you know, what happened, how did it happen, how do we prevent it from happening? You guys help us figure it out and let's make sure that we do it right this time. And I think that everybody was desperately trying to fend off the worst effects institutionally, governmentally, and there just wasn't that opportunity to try to sort this out, and that came later.” [Goldman Sachs AIMS Alternative Investments Symposium, 10/24/13] *Clinton: “Even If It May Not Be 100 Percent True, If The Perception Is That Somehow The Game Is Rigged, That Should Be A Problem For All Of Us.” *“Now, it's important to recognize the vital role that the financial markets play in our economy and that so many of you are contributing to. To function effectively those markets and the men and women who shape them have to command trust and confidence, because we all rely on the market's transparency and integrity. So even if it may not be 100 percent true, if the perception is that somehow the game is rigged, that should be a problem for all of us, and we have to be willing to make that absolutely clear. And if there are issues, if there's wrongdoing, people have to be held accountable and we have to try to deter future bad behavior, because the public trust is at the core of both a free market economy and a democracy.” [Clinton Remarks to Deutsche Bank, 10/7/14] *CLINTON SUGGESTS WALL STREET INSIDERS ARE WHAT IS NEEDED TO FIX WALL STREET* *Clinton Said Financial Reform “Really Has To Come From The Industry Itself.” *“Remember what Teddy Roosevelt did. Yes, he took on what he saw as the excesses in the economy, but he also stood against the excesses in politics. He didn't want to unleash a lot of nationalist, populistic reaction. He wanted to try to figure out how to get back into that balance that has served America so well over our entire nationhood. Today, there's more that can and should be done that really has to come from the industry itself, and how we can strengthen our economy, create more jobs at a time where that's increasingly challenging, to get back to Teddy Roosevelt's square deal. And I really believe that our country and all of you are up to that job.” [Clinton Remarks to Deutsche Bank, 10/7/14] *Speaking About The Importance Of Proper Regulation, Clinton Said “The People That Know The Industry Better Than Anybody Are The People Who Work In The Industry.”* “I mean, it's still happening, as you know. People are looking back and trying to, you know, get compensation for bad mortgages and all the rest of it in some of the agreements that are being reached. There's nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad. How do you get to the golden key, how do we figure out what works? And the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry. And I think there has to be a recognition that, you know, there's so much at stake now, I mean, the business has changed so much and decisions are made so quickly, in nano seconds basically. We spend trillions of dollars to travel around the world, but it's in everybody's interest that we have a better framework, and not just for the United States but for the entire world, in which to operate and trade.” [Goldman Sachs AIMS Alternative Investments Symposium, 10/24/13] *CLINTON ADMITS NEEDING WALL STREET FUNDING* *Clinton Said That Because Candidates Needed Money From Wall Street To Run For Office, People In New York Needed To Ask Tough Questions About The Economy Before Handing Over Campaign Contributions. *“Secondly, running for office in our country takes a lot of money, and candidates have to go out and raise it. New York is probably the leading site for contributions for fundraising for candidates on both sides of the aisle, and it's also our economic center. And there are a lot of people here who should ask some tough questions before handing over campaign contributions to people who were really playing chicken with our whole economy.” [Goldman Sachs AIMS Alternative Investments Symposium, 10/24/13] *Clinton: “It Would Be Very Difficult To Run For President Without Raising A Huge Amount Of Money And Without Having Other People Supporting You Because Your Opponent Will Have Their Supporters.”* “So our system is, in many ways, more difficult, certainly far more expensive and much longer than a parliamentary system, and I really admire the people who subject themselves to it. Even when I, you know, think they should not be elected president, I still think, well, you know, good for you I guess, you're out there promoting democracy and those crazy ideas of yours. So I think that it's something -- I would like -- you know, obviously as somebody who has been through it, I would like it not to last as long because I think it's very distracting from what we should be doing every day in our public business. I would like it not to be so expensive. I have no idea how you do that. I mean, in my campaign -- I lose track, but I think I raised $250 million or some such enormous amount, and in the last campaign President Obama raised 1.1 billion, and that was before the Super PACs and all of this other money just rushing in, and it's so ridiculous that we have this kind of free for all with all of this financial interest at stake, but, you know, the Supreme Court said that's basically what we're in for. So we're kind of in the wild west, and, you know, it would be very difficult to run for president without raising a huge amount of money and without having other people supporting you because your opponent will have their supporters. So I think as hard as it was when I ran, I think it's even harder now.” [Clinton Speech For General Electric’s Global Leadership Meeting – Boca Raton, FL, 1/6/14] *CLINTON TOUTS HER RELATIONSHIP TO WALL STREET AS A SENATOR* *Clinton: As Senator, “I Represented And Worked With” So Many On Wall Street And “Did All I Could To Make Sure They Continued To Prosper” But Still Called For Closing Carried Interest Loophole. *In remarks at Robbins, Gellar, Rudman & Dowd in San Diego, Hillary Clinton said, “When I was a Senator from New York, I represented and worked with so many talented principled people who made their living in finance. But even thought I represented them and did all I could to make sure they continued to prosper, I called for closing the carried interest loophole and addressing skyrocketing CEO pay. I also was calling in '06, '07 for doing something about the mortgage crisis, because I saw every day from Wall Street literally to main streets across New York how a well-functioning financial system is essential. So when I raised early warnings about early warnings about subprime mortgages and called for regulating derivatives and over complex financial products, I didn't get some big arguments, because people sort of said, no, that makes sense. But boy, have we had fights about it ever since.” [Hillary Clinton’s Remarks at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd in San Diego, 9/04/14] *Clinton On Wall Street: “I Had Great Relations And Worked So Close Together After 9/11 To Rebuild Downtown, And A Lot Of Respect For The Work You Do And The People Who Do It.” *“Now, without going over how we got to where we are right now, what would be your advice to the Wall Street community and the big banks as to the way forward with those two important decisions? SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I represented all of you for eight years. I had great relations and worked so close together after 9/11 to rebuild downtown, and a lot of respect for the work you do and the people who do it, but I do -- I think that when we talk about the regulators and the politicians, the economic consequences of bad decisions back in '08, you know, were devastating, and they had repercussions throughout the world.” [Goldman Sachs AIMS Alternative Investments Symposium, 10/24/13] *CLINTON TALKS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES RUNNING FOR OFFICE* *Hillary Clinton Said There Was “A Bias Against People Who Have Led Successful And/Or Complicated Lives,” Citing The Need To Divese Of Assets, Positions, And Stocks.* “SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. Well, you know what Bob Rubin said about that. He said, you know, when he came to Washington, he had a fortune. And when he left Washington, he had a small -- MR. BLANKFEIN: That’s how you have a small fortune, is you go to Washington. SECRETARY CLINTON: You go to Washington. Right. But, you know, part of the problem with the political situation, too, is that there is such a bias against people who have led successful and/or complicated lives. You know, the divestment of assets, the stripping of all kinds of positions, the sale of stocks. It just becomes very onerous and unnecessary.” [Goldman Sachs Builders And Innovators Summit, 10/29/13] *CLINTON SUGGESTS SHE IS A MODERATE* *Clinton Said That Both The Democratic And Republican Parties Should Be “Moderate.” *“URSULA BURNS: Interesting. Democrats? SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, long, definitely. URSULA BURNS: Republicans? SECRETARY CLINTON: Unfortunately, at the time, short. URSULA BURNS: Okay. We'll go back to questions. SECRETARY CLINTON: We need two parties. URSULA BURNS: Yeah, we do need two parties. SECRETARY CLINTON: Two sensible, moderate, pragmatic parties.” [Hillary Clinton Remarks, Remarks at Xerox, 3/18/14] *Clinton: “Simpson-Bowles… Put Forth The Right Framework. Namely, We Have To Restrain Spending, We Have To Have Adequate Revenues, And We Have To Incentivize Growth. It's A Three-Part Formula… And They Reached An Agreement. But What Is Very Hard To Do Is To Then Take That Agreement If You Don't Believe That You're Going To Be Able To Move The Other Side.”* SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, this may be borne more out of hope than experience in the last few years. But Simpson-Bowles -- and I know you heard from Erskine earlier today -- put forth the right framework. Namely, we have to restrain spending, we have to have adequate revenues, and we have to incentivize growth. It's a three-part formula. The specifics can be negotiated depending upon whether we're acting in good faith or not. And what Senator Simpson and Erskine did was to bring Republicans and Democrats alike to the table, and you had the full range of ideological views from I think Tom Coburn to Dick Durbin. And they reached an agreement. But what is very hard to do is to then take that agreement if you don't believe that you're going to be able to move the other side. And where we are now is in this gridlocked dysfunction. So you've got Democrats saying that, you know, you have to have more revenues; that's the sine qua non of any kind of agreement. You have Republicans saying no, no, no on revenues; you have to cut much more deeply into spending. Well, looks what's happened. We are slowly returning to growth. It's not as much or as fast as many of us would like to see, but, you know, we're certainly better off than our European friends, and we're beginning to, I believe, kind of come out of the long aftermath of the '08 crisis. [Clinton Speech For Morgan Stanley, 4/18/13] *Clinton: “The Simpson-Bowles Framework And The Big Elements Of It Were Right… You Have To Restrain Spending, You Have To Have Adequate Revenues, And You Have To Have Growth.”* CLINTON: So, you know, the Simpson-Bowles framework and the big elements of it were right. The specifics can be negotiated and argued over. But you got to do all three. You have to restrain spending, you have to have adequate revenues, and you have to have growth. And I think we are smart enough to figure out how to do that. [Clinton Speech For Morgan Stanley, 4/18/13] *CLINTON IS AWARE OF SECURITY CONCERNS AROUND BLACKBERRIES* *Clinton: “At The State Department We Were Attacked Every Hour, More Than Once An Hour By Incoming Efforts To Penetrate Everything We Had. And That Was True Across The U.S. Government.”* CLINTON: But, at the State Department we were attacked every hour, more than once an hour by incoming efforts to penetrate everything we had. And that was true across the U.S. government. And we knew it was going on when I would go to China, or I would go to Russia, we would leave all of our electronic equipment on the plane, with the batteries out, because this is a new frontier. And they're trying to find out not just about what we do in our government. They're trying to find out about what a lot of companies do and they were going after the personal emails of people who worked in the State Department. So it's not like the only government in the world that is doing anything is the United States. But, the United States compared to a number of our competitors is the only government in the world with any kind of safeguards, any kind of checks and balances. They may in many respects need to be strengthened and people need to be reassured, and they need to have their protections embodied in law. But, I think turning over a lot of that material intentionally or unintentionally, because of the way it can be drained, gave all kinds of information not only to big countries, but to networks and terrorist groups, and the like. So I have a hard time thinking that somebody who is a champion of privacy and liberty has taken refuge in Russia under Putin's authority. And then he calls into a Putin talk show and says, President Putin, do you spy on people? And President Putin says, well, from one intelligence professional to another, of course not. Oh, thank you so much. I mean, really, I don't know. I have a hard time following it. [Clinton Speech At UConn, 4/23/14] *Hillary Clinton: “When I Got To The State Department, It Was Still Against The Rules To Let Most -- Or Let All Foreign Service Officers Have Access To A Blackberry.” *“I mean, let's face it, our government is woefully, woefully behind in all of its policies that affect the use of technology. When I got to the State Department, it was still against the rules to let most -- or let all Foreign Service Officers have access to a Blackberry. You couldn't have desktop computers when Colin Powell was there. Everything that you are taking advantage of, inventing and using, is still a generation or two behind when it comes to our government.” [Hillary Clinton Remarks at Nexenta, 8/28/14] *Hillary Clinton: “We Couldn't Take Our Computers, We Couldn't Take Our Personal Devices” Off The Plane In China And Russia. *“I mean, probably the most frustrating part of this whole debate are countries acting like we're the only people in the world trying to figure out what's going on. I mean, every time I went to countries like China or Russia, I mean, we couldn't take our computers, we couldn't take our personal devices, we couldn't take anything off the plane because they're so good, they would penetrate them in a minute, less, a nanosecond. So we would take the batteries out, we'd leave them on the plane.” [Hillary Clinton Remarks at Nexenta, 8/28/14] *Clinton Said When She Got To State, Employees “Were Not Mostly Permitted To Have Handheld Devices.”* “You know, when Colin Powell showed up as Secretary of State in 2001, most State Department employees still didn't even have computers on their desks. When I got there they were not mostly permitted to have handheld devices. I mean, so you're thinking how do we operate in this new environment dominated by technology, globalizing forces? We have to change, and I can't expect people to change if I don't try to model it and lead it.” [Clinton Speech For General Electric’s Global Leadership Meeting – Boca Raton, FL, 1/6/14] *Hillary Clinton Said You Know You Can’t Bring Your Phone And Computer When Traveling To China And Russia And She Had To Take Her Batteries Out And Put them In A Special Box. *“And anybody who has ever traveled in other countries, some of which shall remain nameless, except for Russia and China, you know that you can’t bring your phones and your computers. And if you do, good luck. I mean, we would not only take the batteries out, we would leave the batteries and the devices on the plane in special boxes. Now, we didn’t do that because we thought it would be fun to tell somebody about. We did it because we knew that we were all targets and that we would be totally vulnerable. So it’s not only what others do to us and what we do to them and how many people are involved in it. It’s what’s the purpose of it, what is being collected, and how can it be used. And there are clearly people in this room who know a lot about this, and some of you could be very useful contributors to that conversation because you’re sophisticated enough to know that it’s not just, do it, don’t do it. We have to have a way of doing it, and then we have to have a way of analyzing it, and then we have to have a way of sharing it.” [Goldman Sachs Builders And Innovators Summit, 10/29/13] *Hillary Clinton Lamented How Far Behind The State Department Was In Technology, Saying “People Were Not Even Allowed To Use Mobile Devices Because Of Security Issues.” *“Personally, having, you know, lived and worked in the White House, having been a senator, having been Secretary of State, there has traditionally been a great pool of very talented, hard-working people. And just as I was saying about the credit market, our personnel policies haven’t kept up with the changes necessary in government. We have a lot of difficulties in getting—when I got to the State Department, we were so far behind in technology, it was embarrassing. And, you know, people were not even allowed to use mobile devices because of security issues and cost issues, and we really had to try to push into the last part of the 20th Century in order to get people functioning in 2009 and ‘10.” [Goldman Sachs Builders And Innovators Summit, 10/29/13] *CLINTON REMARKS ARE PRO KEYSTONE AND PRO TRADE* *Clinton: “So I Think That Keystone Is A Contentious Issue, And Of Course It Is Important On Both Sides Of The Border For Different And Sometimes Opposing Reasons…” *“So I think that Keystone is a contentious issue, and of course it is important on both sides of the border for different and sometimes opposing reasons, but that is not our relationship. And I think our relationship will get deeper and stronger and put us in a position to really be global leaders in energy and climate change if we worked more closely together. And that's what I would like to see us do.” [Remarks at tinePublic, 6/18/14] *Hillary Clinton Said Her Dream Is A Hemispheric Common Market, With Open Trade And Open Markets. *“My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.” [05162013 Remarks to Banco Itau.doc, p. 28] *Hillary Clinton Said We Have To Have A Concerted Plan To Increase Trade; We Have To Resist Protectionism And Other Kinds Of Barriers To Trade. *“Secondly, I think we have to have a concerted plan to increase trade already under the current circumstances, you know, that Inter-American Development Bank figure is pretty surprising. There is so much more we can do, there is a lot of low hanging fruit but businesses on both sides have to make it a priority and it's not for governments to do but governments can either make it easy or make it hard and we have to resist, protectionism, other kinds of barriers to market access and to trade and I would like to see this get much more attention and be not just a policy for a year under president X or president Y but a consistent one.” [05162013 Remarks to Banco Itau.doc, p. 32] *CLINTON IS MORE FAVORABLE TO CANADIAN HEALTH CARE AND SINGLE PAYER* *Clinton Said Single-Payer Health Care Systems “Can Get Costs Down,” And “Is As Good Or Better On Primary Care,” But “They Do Impose Things Like Waiting Times.” *“If you look at countries that are comparable, like Switzerland or Germany, for example, they have mixed systems. They don't have just a single-payer system, but they have very clear controls over budgeting and accountability. If you look at the single-payer systems, like Scandinavia, Canada, and elsewhere, they can get costs down because, you know, although their care, according to statistics, overall is as good or better on primary care, in particular, they do impose things like waiting times, you know. It takes longer to get like a hip replacement than it might take here.” [Hillary Clinton remarks to ECGR Grand Rapids, 6/17/13] *Clinton Cited President Johnson’s Success In Establishing Medicare And Medicaid And Said She Wanted To See The U.S. Have Universal Health Care Like In Canada.* “You know, on healthcare we are the prisoner of our past. The way we got to develop any kind of medical insurance program was during World War II when companies facing shortages of workers began to offer healthcare benefits as an inducement for employment. So from the early 1940s healthcare was seen as a privilege connected to employment. And after the war when soldiers came back and went back into the market there was a lot of competition, because the economy was so heated up. So that model continued. And then of course our large labor unions bargained for healthcare with the employers that their members worked for. So from the early 1940s until the early 1960s we did not have any Medicare, or our program for the poor called Medicaid until President Johnson was able to get both passed in 1965. So the employer model continued as the primary means by which working people got health insurance. People over 65 were eligible for Medicare. Medicaid, which was a partnership, a funding partnership between the federal government and state governments, provided some, but by no means all poor people with access to healthcare. So what we've been struggling with certainly Harry Truman, then Johnson was successful on Medicare and Medicaid, but didn't touch the employer based system, then actually Richard Nixon made a proposal that didn't go anywhere, but was quite far reaching. Then with my husband's administration we worked very hard to come up with a system, but we were very much constricted by the political realities that if you had your insurance from your employer you were reluctant to try anything else. And so we were trying to build a universal system around the employer-based system. And indeed now with President Obama's legislative success in getting the Affordable Care Act passed that is what we've done. We still have primarily an employer-based system, but we now have people able to get subsidized insurance. So we have health insurance companies playing a major role in the provision of healthcare, both to the employed whose employers provide health insurance, and to those who are working but on their own are not able to afford it and their employers either don't provide it, or don't provide it at an affordable price. We are still struggling. We've made a lot of progress. Ten million Americans now have insurance who didn't have it before the Affordable Care Act, and that is a great step forward. (Applause.) And what we're going to have to continue to do is monitor what the costs are and watch closely to see whether employers drop more people from insurance so that they go into what we call the health exchange system. So we're really just at the beginning. But we do have Medicare for people over 65. And you couldn't, I don't think, take it away if you tried, because people are very satisfied with it, but we also have a lot of political and financial resistance to expanding that system to more people. So we're in a learning period as we move forward with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. And I'm hoping that whatever the shortfalls or the glitches have been, which in a big piece of legislation you're going to have, those will be remedied and we can really take a hard look at what's succeeding, fix what isn't, and keep moving forward to get to affordable universal healthcare coverage like you have here in Canada.

With no trace of Thompson, one officer continued to search for him as the other two pried opened three locked deep freezers. Upon their discovery, 11 decapitated bodies were found frozen, while the heads where in ziplock freezer bags. All of the bodies appeared to have been Caucasian women, possibly in their early to mid-20’s. The heads that were found all had the words “Black Lives Matter” carved into the foreheads. The bodies were were preserved, possibly from being stored in the deep freezers.The police radioed for back up and the other freezers were opened where 8 more bodies in similar condition were found, however one of the women was still alive. Authorities at the scene helped the woman out of the freezer and waited for paramedics to arrive.“I was kidnapped by this Black guy after I left work earlier today. We talked for while at Starbucks, where I work, before everything happened. At first he seemed pretty nice but he had this weird twitch that happened every couple of minutes. He asked if he could walk me to my car and I said yes, but that is when everything went dark. When I woke up, I was in this basement and I saw that guy I was with earlier taking saws up the stairs. I cried for help and that is when he stuffed me into a freezer where I saw dead bodies. I must have passed out from shock or something but I am happy you guys found me,” said to police by the victim.Officer Douglas, who was searching for Thompson, found him in a crawl space in the basement. Police ran a background check on him and discovered that he was arrested during a protest for the police involved shooting death of Laquan McDonald. Thompson had no prior criminal record according to authorities.The names of the victims have not been released. Thompson was taken into custody by police and had later tested positive for PCP which authorities believe may have lead to Thompson’s crimes.Related Items:

The video culminates with these claims, which appear in red letters: ""6.4 million more Americans living in poverty under President Obama"" and ""over 90 rounds of golf.""We’ve already checked the sporty part of that claim, rating as True the statement that Obama has played more than 90 rounds of golf since he became president. Here, we’ll focus on Dewhurst’s claim that the ranks of the poor have grown by 6.4 million.As backup, Dewhurst’s campaign sent us a January 2012 editorial from the conservative Washington Examiner that says ""there are 6.4 million more Americans in poverty today than when Obama took office.""Dewhurst’s campaign also pointed us to a page from the website of the Senate Republican Conference, which consists of Republican members of the U.S. Senate. The page — dated April 2, 2012, and titled ""He’s Made it Worse: The Obama Economic Record"" — is presented as a comparison of conditions when Obama became president and ""today"" according to statistics such as the unemployment rate and the size of the federal debt.Under ""Americans in Poverty,"" the page says there were 39.8 million on Obama’s inauguration day (Jan. 20, 2009) and are 46.2 million ""today."" The difference: 6.4 million people.The page does not give a source for the poverty numbers, so we turned to the U.S. Census Bureau, which is the official federal source of poverty statistics. The bureau uses a measure of poverty called the ""poverty thresholds"" to help determine the number of U.S. residents living in poverty. If a family has an income below the relevant threshold, then the members of that family are considered to be living in poverty.The bureau’s thresholds, which are adjusted annually for inflation, vary by family size. For example, the preliminary figures for 2011, which are the most recent thresholds, show that a family of four people would be considered to be living in poverty if it earned less than $23,018 through the year. Alternatively, the 2011 threshold for single people younger than 65 is $11,702.The bureau’s thresholds are different from the poverty guidelines overseen by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which are used to determine if applicants are eligible for government assistance programs.Census Bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein told us that the bureau estimates the number of U.S. residents living in poverty on an annual basis. The figure is based on a survey of a scientifically selected sample of about 100,000 households that takes place between February and April each year.The survey asks respondents their income for the previous year. And from the survey results, the bureau extrapolates the number of U.S. residents that were living in poverty that year.The 2010 poverty statistics were released in September 2011. The next estimate of the number of U.S. residents living in poverty, for 2011, is scheduled for release in September 2012.We should note that there have long been concerns about the bureau’s measure, which determines a person or family’s poverty status based on before-tax cash income. One of the primary identified weaknesses with this method is that it does not take into account government policies or benefits that can shrink a family’s income (such as payroll taxes) or enhance it (such as food stamps). Another criticism: The thresholds are not adjusted to account for variations in the cost of living in different places.We checked the bureau’s poverty figures to compare with the Senate Republican Conference’s data and found that the group was comparing the number of Americans in poverty in 2008 to the number in 2010. In other words, the Senate group used the bureau’s 2008 statistic — 39.8 million — for the number of people in poverty on Obama’s inauguration day in January 2009. And it used the 2010 statistic — 46.2 million, the most recent — for its count of poor Americans in April 2012.The bureau data show that the estimated number of U.S. residents in poverty in 2010, Obama’s second year in office, was greater by 6.4 million than it was in 2008, George W. Bush’s final full year in office. The largest increase came in 2009, Obama’s first year in office, when the poverty total was 3.8 million higher than the year before. In 2010, the number was 2.6 million greater than the 2009 level.The 46.2 million residents in poverty in 2010 amounted to the greatest number of Americans in the low-income category since the government started tracking the statistic in 1959.But the recent increase did not start on Obama’s watch. The number of Americans living in poverty, by the bureau’s measure, first creeped up in 2007, when 800,000 more people were in poverty than the year before. The subsequent 2008 increase: 2.5 million people.In fact, during Bush’s eight years as president, the estimated number of Americans in poverty rose every year but two. We applied the Dewhurst campaign’s methodology to the Bush years, comparing the number of people in poverty the year before Bush took office (2000) with the number during his last full year in office (2008). We found an increase of 8.2 million people.In making such comparisons, though, there is another, better way to judge change.As PolitiFact noted in a previous fact-check , because of population growth, it’s important to notice shifts in the share of all residents in poverty. And during the years Dewhurst focused on, the portion of U.S. residents in poverty increased, although like the estimated number of people in poverty, the climb began in 2007. The figures:** 2006: 12.3 percent** 2007: 12.5 percent (0.2 percentage point increase)** 2008: 13.2 percent (0.7 percentage point increase)** 2009: 14.3 percent (1.1 percentage point increase)** 2010: 15.1 percent (0.8 percentage point increase)The 2010 poverty rate of 15.1 percent was higher than that of every year for more than four decades, save two — 1983, when the rate was 15.2 percent, and 1993, when it was the same as the 2010 figure, 15.1 percent.A September 2011 New York Times news article about the 2010 poverty statistics said economists pointed to joblessness associated with the 2008 financial collapse and subsequent recession as the main factor pushing more Americans into poverty.A final note: Dewhurst implies that Obama is to blame for the rising number of people in poverty.But our sense is that it’s unfair to place all the responsibility in the president’s lap. The economic downturn began before Obama took office. Also, poverty experts such as Sheldon Danziger, director of the National Poverty Center at the University of Michigan, say that more Americans would have been forced into poverty without the 2009 federal stimulus plan, championed by Obama, which included billions of dollars for programs that help low-income Americans such as Medicaid and unemployment insurance. More broadly, no single official controls the number of Americans living in poverty.Our rulingDewhurst’s figures draw from a reliable source on Americans in poverty in 2010 — which, of course, is not 2012 — compared with 2008, the year before Obama became president.A better understanding of the extent of U.S. poverty lies in looking at the share of Americans in dire straits. That measure also supports Dewhurst’s point — that poverty has increased during Obama’s term. Then again, the percentage of residents in poverty had begun to grow in 2007, two years before Obama’s first in office.Finally, it’s a reach to say Obama is personally to blame for the increase in poverty.On balance, we rate Dewhurst’s statement Half True.Advertisement"

Her story was well known to independent counsel Ken Starr, to House impeachment managers, to Washington insiders and Capitol Hill reporters. A month ago, she gave an interview to NBC News correspondent Lisa Myers. Since then NBC News has been carefully investigating this story — combing through state records, court documents and newspapers, cross-checking dates and events, talking to more than 80 people, and repeatedly requesting information from the White House.LAST WEEK, as NBC News continued its investigation, Jane Doe Number 5 went public with her extraordinary allegation — that she was sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton 21 years ago. To some this is an old and unprovable accusation that should never have been circulated to begin with. To others it’s a story that must be told. Is she to be believed? Or is Jane Doe Number 5 the latest weapon in a relentless political war against Bill Clinton?Juanita Broaddrick: “It’s important to me to tell what happened. I don’t know how people are going to take this. I don’t know what they’re going to think after all these years and months why I’ve come forward.”Jane Doe Number 5 is 56-year-old Juanita Broaddrick, a successful businesswoman who has been the subject of intense political and media speculation. Rumors about Broaddrick’s story have been floating around Arkansas and Washington for years, known to both Clinton haters and supporters.Broaddrick was pulled into the Paula Jones case, she met with investigators for the House Judiciary Committee and was interviewed by Ken Starr’s investigators. And though what she told Starr remains sealed it was seen by 40 members of Congress before the impeachment vote in the House. Later House Republican Whip Tom Delay publicly urged senators to find out what Jane Doe Number 5 had to say before deciding the fate of the president.As the whispers about her grew, Broaddrick found herself hounded by the media — and she says she was the subject of gossip and half truths on the Internet and in the tabloids.Juanita Broaddrick: “All these stories are floating around. Different stories of what really happened, of what people think happened and I was tired of everybody putting their own spin on it.”The Broaddrick story became public last week, and since then her story has appeared in print, on radio and TV.But much of what you may have read or heard is incomplete. While NBC News was investigating this story and seeking comment from the White House, our work became the subject of much speculation.Tonight, you’ll see what we were able to learn and you’ll hear from Juanita Broaddrick herself — a woman who remained silent for two decades and who admits she has lied under oath about this story in the past but now says she wants to tell the truth.Juanita Broaddrick’s story begins in 1978 — she was a registered nurse who had started her own nursing home in Van Buren, Arkansas. Bill Clinton was the state attorney general who was running for governor:Juanita Broaddrick: “I thought he was just something that was gonna be really good for Arkansas. Thought he was a very charismatic man, that had bright ideas for our state… I just really liked him.”Broaddrick, whose married name at the time was Juanita Hickey, says she was so impressed with Clinton she volunteered to hand out bumper stickers and signs — her first and only political campaign. Broaddrick says she met Clinton for the first time when he made a campaign stop at her nursing home in the spring of 1978.Juanita Broaddrick: “While he was there visiting, he said ‘If you’re ever in the, ah you know, Little Rock area, please drop by our campaign office,’ and he said ‘be sure to call me when you come in and call down to the campaign office.’”Broaddrick says not long after that conversation she did go to Little Rock for a nursing home meeting held at the Camelot Hotel — now the Doubletree. She says she checked into the hotel and the next morning called Clinton campaign headquarters. She says she was told Clinton was at his apartment and to call him there.Juanita Broaddrick: “I did call and ask him if he was gonna be at the headquarters that day and he said no he didn’t plan to be there. He says, Clinton said, ‘Why don’t I just meet you for coffee in the Camelot coffee shop?’”But Broaddrick says Clinton called later — she thinks it was around 9 in the morning — and asked if they could meet in her hotel room because there were reporters in the coffee shop.Lisa Myers: “Did you think his interest in you at the time was personal or professional?”Juanita Broaddrick: “I thought it was professional, completely.”Myers: “So you thought this was going to be a business meeting?”Broaddrick: “Yes I did, I really did.”Myers: “Did you have qualms at all about him coming to the room?”Broaddrick: “I was a little bit uneasy. But, I felt, ah, a real friendship toward this man and I didn’t really feel any, um any danger in him coming to my room. I sort of ushered us over to the coffee — I had coffee sitting on a little table over there by the window and it was a real pretty window view that looked down at the river. And he came around me and sort of put his arm over my shoulder to point to this little building and he said he was real interested if he became governor to restore that little building and then all of a sudden, he turned me around and started kissing me. And that was a real shock.”Myers: “What did you do?”Broaddrick: “I first pushed him away and just told him ‘No, please don’t do that,” and I forget, it’s been 21 years, Lisa, and I forget exactly what he was saying. It seems like he was making statements that would relate to ‘Did you not know why I was coming up here?’ and I told him at the time, I said, ‘I’m married, and I have other things going on in my life, and this is something that I’m not interested in.’”Myers: “Had you, that morning, or any other time, given him any reason to believe you might be receptive?”Broaddrick: “No. None. None whatsoever.”Myers: “Then what happens?”Broaddrick: “Then he tries to kiss me again. And the second time he tries to kiss me he starts biting my lip (she cries). Just a minute... He starts to, um, bite on my top lip and I tried to pull away from him. (crying) And then he forces me down on the bed. And I just was very frightened, and I tried to get away from him and I told him ‘No,’ that I didn’t want this to happen (crying) but he wouldn’t listen to me.”Myers: “Did you resist, did you tell him to stop?”Broaddrick: “Yes, I told him ‘Please don’t.’ He was such a different person at that moment, he was just a vicious awful person.”Myers: “You said there was a point at which you stopped resisting?”Broaddrick: “Yeah.”Myers: “Why?”Broaddrick: “It was a real panicky, panicky situation. I was even to the point where I was getting very noisy, you know, yelling to ‘Please stop.’ And that’s when he pressed down on my right shoulder and he would bite my lip.”Broaddrick also says the waist of her skirt and her pantyhose were torn.Juanita Broaddrick: “When everything was over with, he got up and straightened himself, and I was crying at the moment and he walks to the door, and calmly puts on his sunglasses. And before he goes out the door he says ‘You better get some ice on that.’ And he turned and went out the door.”Myers: “On your lip?”Broaddrick: “Yeah.”Broaddrick estimates Clinton was in her room less than 30 minutes.Myers: “Is there any way at all that Bill Clinton could have thought that this was consensual?”Broaddrick: “No. Not with what I told him, and with how I tried to push him away. It was not consensual.”Myers: “You’re saying that Bill Clinton sexually assaulted you, that he raped you.”Broaddrick: “Yes.”Myers: “And there is no doubt in your mind that that’s what happened?”Broaddrick: “No doubt whatsoever.”While the president and his lawyer declined to be interviewed on camera, through his lawyer the president did issue a statement saying any allegation he assaulted Broaddrick is “absolutely false” and when asked about it Wednesday the president said he had nothing to add to that statement.It’s important to note — and Broaddrick concedes — that aside from her, there are no witnesses and as far as we know, no one saw Clinton enter or leave Broaddrick’s room, or even the hotel. She took no photos, kept no evidence and the hotel has no records to confirm that she stayed there. However, Broaddrick does have a friend who backs up her story.Norma Kelsey did not want to be interviewed on camera. However she told us she did accompany Broaddrick on that business trip to Little Rock — they even shared a hotel room. Norma says when she left that morning Broaddrick told her she was planning to see Clinton. But Norma says when she called around lunchtime, Broaddrick was upset and crying so she returned to the room.Juanita Broaddrick: “Well, I was very emotional within an hour or so after it happened and then by the time Norma got back my whole top lip was turned out, was very swollen and very ugly looking.”Norma also says that Broaddrick’s lip and mouth were badly swollen, that her pantyhose had been ripped off and she says Broaddrick told her she had been sexually assaulted by Clinton.Myers: “Did you feel any internal injuries?”Broaddrick: “Of course. I felt, I felt, just the whole thing you can imagine of being violated. I felt, of course there was pain.”Myers: “Did you consider going to a doctor?”Broaddrick: “No. Not at all. I just wanted to get home. I just, ah, I wanted it to all go away. I wanted to just walk outta there and forget that it had never happened, because I felt very responsible that I had allowed him to come to my room.”Broaddrick says she decided to leave the hotel immediately without going to the nursing home meeting. She says after Norma helped ice her lip, the two of them left Little Rock and drove more than two hours back to Van Buren.Juanita Broaddrick: “We were still in shock, Lisa, over what had happened… It was like this is a horrible thing and I’m gonna wake up in a minute and this is not going to be true.”Norma told us on the drive back, Broaddrick was very, very upset and in shock and says Broaddrick blamed herself for letting Clinton in her room. And Broaddrick says she never considered going to the police — especially since Clinton was the Arkansas attorney general at the time.Myers: “The question everyone is going to ask is ‘Juanita, why didn’t you report this 21 years ago?’”Broaddrick: “I didn’t think anyone would believe me in the world.”If Juanita Broaddrick ever wanted to press charges against Bill Clinton, it’s too late. The statute of limitations in Arkansas is six years.If something did happen in that hotel room, who else knew about it? NBC News spent four weeks trying to confirm as many details as possible.Lisa Myers: “Did you tell your husband when you got home?”Juanita Broaddrick: “No, my husband never knew.”Juanita Broaddrick says that at the time of the alleged sexual assault her marriage was on the rocks. She says she never told her husband, Gary Hickey, about the alleged incident and told him the swollen lip was the result of an accident. Hickey tells NBC News he doesn’t recall either the injury or her explanation. At the time, she was having an affair with the man who would become her second husband — David Broaddrick — to whom she’s been married 18 years. She says she saw David and told him what happened soon after she returned home.Myers: “Did she have any visible injuries?”David Broaddrick: “Yes. She, uh, her top lip was black.”Myers: “As best you can remember, what did she tell you?”David Broaddrick: “Uh, like I said, I don’t remember the words but that she had been raped by Bill Clinton.”Myers: “Other than her lip, did she have any injuries?”David Broaddrick: “Just mentally she was in bad shape.”Juanita Broaddrick also says her affair with David made her even more reluctant to report the incident:Juanita Broaddrick: “I don’t think I would have been real honorable back then in the 70s to have been married and having this affair. I just didn’t think anyone would have believed me.”So who else did Broaddrick talk to?Three of her friends tell NBC News she told them about the alleged incident at the time: Susan Lewis...Susan Lewis: “It was very traumatic for her.”Louise Ma...Myers: “Did you urge her to report it?”Louise Ma: “No.”Myers: “Why not?”Louise Ma: “Because women were made victims at the time. And you know what the courts were like in that time period. It was always the woman’s fault.”And Jean Darden, the sister of Norma Kelsey, the woman who says she saw Juanita at the hotel. Both admit they have a serious reason not to like Bill Clinton — in 1981 as governor, Clinton commuted the life sentence of their father’s killer, making him eligible for parole.The stories her friends tell from 20 years ago are consistent — and Broaddrick herself says she recalls many details. For instance, the outfit she was wearing, the hotel room furnishings, and the time of year — spring. However, there is one important thing she does not remember — when the alleged incident happened: not the date, not even the month.Lisa Myers: “Some people would say, how can you not remember the specific date of an event as traumatic as this?”Juanita Broaddrick: “I really don’t have an answer for that except to say I remember the approximate time of year. I probably should remember the date, although it’s something I wanted to forget.”So NBC News tried to figure out the date of the alleged assault.Broaddrick gave us access to all the business and personal records she says she could find. We also checked public records, nursing home records and convention schedules.And indeed there was a nursing home meeting at the Camelot Hotel in Little Rock on April 25, 1978. Further, state records show Broaddrick got credit for a nursing home seminar that was held that day, April 25.So was Bill Clinton even in Little Rock on April 25, 1978? Despite our repeated requests, the White House would not answer that question and declined to release any information about his schedule.So we checked 45 Arkansas newspapers and talked to a dozen former Clinton staffers. We found no evidence that Clinton had any public appearances on the morning in question. Articles in Arkansas newspapers suggest he was in Little Rock that day.And remember the little building Broaddrick says Clinton pointed to just before the alleged assault in the hotel room? We checked that too, and in fact the Pulaski County jail was visible from rooms facing the river. It has since been demolished.But what happened after the alleged assault? It turns out, just three weeks later Broaddrick actually attended a Clinton fundraiser with her first husband.Myers: “Some people would wonder why you would go to a fundraiser for someone who you say sexually assaulted you. Couldn’t you have said you were sick or gotten out of it?”Broaddrick: “I think I was still in denial that time exactly what had happened to me. I still felt very guilty at that time that it was my fault. By letting him come to the room I had given him the wrong idea and just shut up and accept your punishment and don’t ever do it again.”Broaddrick also told us Clinton called her a half dozen times at the nursing home. She says he got through once and asked her when she was coming back to Little Rock. Her response, she says, “I’m not.”Then in 1979, a year after the alleged assault, Broaddrick was named by Clinton to a non-paying position on a state advisory board.Myers: “Did you have reservations about accepting any appointment by Governor Clinton?”Broaddrick: “Yes, but I had more or less said to the association that I would do this before I knew it was a governor appointing job. When I agreed to do it I had no idea it was an appointment.”Over the years, Broaddrick said she had business dealings with the governor’s office but not Clinton personally. In 1984, she received a letter signed by Clinton after her nursing home was named one of the state’s best facilities. At the bottom, there is a handwritten note that says, “I admire you very much.” A routine political thank you? She interprets it as a thank you for her silence.In 1990, Clinton honored one of the patients at the nursing home, but Broaddrick says she wasn’t there, and didn’t learn of the visit until after the fact.Broaddrick says she had no face-to-face contact with Clinton until 1991, when she attended a meeting in Little Rock with two friends. They all say it was a nursing home meeting — but none can remember the date, nor do they have any records — so we can’t confirm it.Broaddrick does remember that she was suddenly called out of the meeting, and, she says, to her surprise, there was Bill Clinton in the hallway. One friend says she saw them talking:Broaddrick: “And he immediately began this profuse apology, saying, ‘Juanita, I’m so sorry for what I did. I’m not the man that I used to be, can you ever forgive me? What can I do to make this up to you?’ And I’m standing there in absolute shock. And I told him to go to hell, and I walked off.”But Broaddrick remained silent when she learned soon after that Clinton was making a bid for the Oval Office.Myers: “Here the man is running for president, doesn’t the country have a right to know this?”Broaddrick: “Yes, and that’s what I got to thinking about — David and I talked about it. We talked about it, and I cried about it. It brought up a lot of hurt, and a lot of things that I’d buried years ago. And then we just decided it wouldn’t be in our best interest to do it. So we decided not to.”In fact, Clinton’s political opponents say she rebuffed their efforts to get her to come forward before the 1992 election. After she turned them down, one of the men suggested she had been paid off.Myers: “Did you receive any payoff to stay silent?”Broaddrick: “Oh goodness, no. I mean how could anyone be bribed or paid-off for, for something that, to not say anything about something that horrible?”Myers: “Did Bill Clinton or anyone near him ever threaten you, try to intimidate you, do anything to keep you silent?”Broaddrick: “No.”Myers: “This has been strictly your choice.”Broaddrick: “Yes.”Broaddrick says she was determined to keep the incident quiet.But in 1997, her hand was forced when she was subpoenaed by Paula Jones’ lawyers.She filed an affidavit in that case — under oath as Jane Doe 5 — denying any “unwelcome sexual advances” by Clinton. She said “These allegations are untrue,” and “there is no truth to the rumors.”Broaddrick: “I didn’t want to be forced to testify about one of the most horrific events in my life. I didn’t want to go through it again.”She later told the same story, denying the assault, in a sworn deposition in the Jones case.Myers: “Last March another woman comes forward, Kathleen Willey, accuses the president of unwanted sexual advances — why didn’t you come forward?”Broaddrick: “Well Lisa, I would get up in the morning and I would think: it’s the thing to do. Then by nighttime I would think that could bring no good whatsoever to my life. And I’m sorry for these women. I’m sorry for what they went through, but I just wasn’t brave enough to do it. There’s nothing else to say.”But she changed her mind and changed her story, when Independent Counsel Ken Starr’s office approached her last April — investigating wrong-doing in the Jones case.Broaddrick says she feared lying to a federal grand jury, and once Starr granted her immunity from prosecution for perjury — she agreed to come forward with details of her allegations against Clinton.But Starr did not pursue the allegations further because he was investigating obstruction of justice charges against the president. Broaddrick never alleged any obstruction — said the president never urged her to lie — so Starr didn’t pursue the allegations any further.Finally, after months of contact with us, Broaddrick decided to speak to NBC News, on Jan. 20, in the middle of the Senate impeachment trial.Myers: “Then why now Juanita?”Broaddrick: (Very emotional) “I just couldn’t hold it in any longer. I didn’t want [my] granddaughters and nieces, when they’re 21 years old to turn to me and say, ‘Why didn’t you tell what this man did to you?’”We repeatedly asked the White House what it knew about Juanita Broaddrick — about her character or possible motivation. We got no response.We checked with local and federal law enforcement officials, who told us she’s a solid citizen with no criminal record and that they take her allegations very seriously.Broaddrick knows that some people have suggested her injuries 21 years ago were inflicted not by Clinton, but by her first husband, Gary Hickey.Divorce papers obtained by NBC News show that one year after the alleged assault by Clinton, Juanita and Hickey had an altercation. She says Hickey struck her in the mouth. He told NBC News it was an accident. Broaddrick says that is the only time her husband hit her, and there are no records of any earlier incident.Could Broaddrick have a financial motive — is she hoping to cash in? She says she and her husband are financially comfortable, have turned down any offer to tell her story for money, and have no plans for anything else.Myers: “No book deal?”Broaddrick: “No book deal.”Myers: “No lawsuit?Broaddrick: “Absolutely not. I don’t want to sue Bill Clinton and I do not want to write a book.”Finally, did Broaddrick have any other motivation for going public now with her allegations? Were politics behind the decision? Broaddrick’s personal attorney is a Republican state senator in Arkansas, but he says he did not know she decided to go public until she talked to NBC. Broaddrick says she is not registered with any political party — and the Broadrricks say they have donated money to both Republican and Democratic candidates.Myers: “What is the purpose? Do you want to destroy the president?”Broaddrick: “No, I don’t want to do anything. I do not have an agenda. I want to put all these rumors to rest. I buried this a long time ago, Lisa, and the only thing I’m trying to do now is clear up all these stories.”But after all this time, how does Juanita Broaddrick feel about Bill Clinton?Broaddrick: “I couldn’t say it on the air. My hatred for him is overwhelming.”Overwhelming enough to invent a story, to distort a memory, all to destroy a presidency? Absolutely not, she says.Myers: “Twenty years after it happened, having never reported it to authorities, after signing an affidavit denying anything ever happened, now you come forward. You understand how skeptical people may be?”Broaddrick: “Certainly I can. But I was also afraid what would happen to me if I came forward. I was afraid that I would be destroyed like so many of the other women have been.”Myers: “Do you understand the enormity of what you’re saying? To him and to you?”Broaddrick: “Yes I do. It’s been a long hard uphill battle to make these statements. But I feel like I have to. I feel like I have to make these statements now.”So now there is a face, a voice, a name for Jane Doe Number 5. Her story — just the rumor of it — has influenced politics and journalism, opened up her own life to public scrutiny and cast yet another shadow over the president, who denies the charge.In the end, the questions remain: Was it sexual assault? Could it have been consensual sex? Did anything happen at all?

He's led a very strong life, and I feel very badly.”Trump tried to equate Flynn's actions with those of his 2016 campaign opponent, Hillary Clinton, although the former Democratic presidential nominee has not been charged with lying to the FBI.“I will say this: Hillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI,” Trump said. “Nothing happened to her. Flynn lied, and they destroyed his life. I think it's a shame. Hillary Clinton, on the 4th of July weekend, went to the FBI, not under oath. It was the most incredible thing anyone's ever seen. She lied many times. Nothing happened to her. Flynn lied, and it's like they ruined his life. It's very unfair.”Trump was referencing Clinton's closed-door interview with the FBI in July 2016, as part of the bureau's investigation into her use of a private email server as secretary of state.Although the FBI's probe and the circumstances of Clinton's interview have drawn criticism, Clinton has not been charged with providing false statements to the bureau. White House spokesmen did not immediately respond to a request to substantiate Trump's allegation that she had “lied many times” to the FBI.[ Trump lawyer says president knew Flynn had given FBI the same account he gave to vice president ]Trump's Monday morning appearance before reporters was brief. He did not respond to shouted questions from journalists about when he first found out that Flynn lied to the FBI, nor did he answer queries about his endorsement of Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, who stands accused of making unwanted sexual advances on teenage girls when he was in his 30s.[ Trump: ‘We need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama’ ]Flynn pleaded guilty Friday to lying to the FBI about his contacts with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn said he had agreed to cooperate with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation of Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election, a wide-ranging probe that includes possible coordination with the Trump campaign as well as possible obstruction of justice by the now-president.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)If it weren’t for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, there likely wouldn’t yet be an Iran nuclear deal, according to the former Secretary of State .While her Republican rivals who oppose the Iran deal might use that line against her, Clinton has touted progress with Iran as one of the hallmarks of her tenure at the State Department.""I spent 18 months putting together the sanctions against Iran so that we could force them to the negotiating table,"" she said at the MSNBC Democratic forum Nov. 6.She’s said this line a few times throughout her campaign, so we decided to dig into it.According to her campaign, Clinton was referring to her first 18 months as secretary -- from January 2009 to June 2010. During this time, U.S. and global sanctions on Iran increased, it’s fair to say that Clinton and the State Department played a major role in this development.The invitationUpping sanctions on Iran was a clear priority for Clinton’s State Department. She talked at length about the importance of pressuring Iran to discontinue nuclear activity, including through sanctions, at her nomination hearing in January 2009. She and other members of President Barack Obama’s administration regularly spoke publicly about the topic throughout her first 18 months in office.During this time period, the State Department -- top aides and Clinton herself -- led the diplomatic lobbying effort to get other countries to join the U.S. plan to pressure Iran, overcoming large hurdles such as getting Russia and China to get on board. In her memoir Hard Choices, Clinton recalls hashing out final details of a plan over drinks with a Chinese official.In June 2010, the United Nations Security Council approved tough new sanctions on Iran -- including expanding an arms embargo and restricting certain financial and shipping enterprises. At the time, Obama called them ""the toughest sanctions ever faced by the Iranian government.""Those sanctions enabled even tougher measures from the United States and the European Union , which were passed immediately. Congress passed several more bills containing additional sanctions on Iran during the rest of Clinton’s tenure, which ended in early 2013.While the Treasury is the primary agency responsible for enforcing sanctions, Clinton appointed a special adviser in 2010 to oversee U.S. efforts ""to ensure full and effective implementation of all U.N. Security Council resolutions related to Iran, including most recently UNSCR 1929.""Experts told us that Clinton is correct to take some of the credit for the rapid increase in international sanctions on Iran, and these sanctions were a big part of the reason why Iran rejoined multilateral talks about its nuclear program.The RSVPThe State Department was key to getting other countries to go along with and add to U.S. efforts to pressure Iran, said Patrick Clawson, senior fellow and research director at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He added that her claim doesn’t give enough credit to other players but is essentially correct.Clawson specifically noted that he is ""not a fan nor a political supporter of Clinton.""The international sanction ramp-up ""shocked Iran's leaders,"" Clawson said. ""Besides the pain the sanctions inflicted, they raised the possibility more -- worse -- was coming. That was a key factor pushing Iran to resume more serious talks.""There is room for subjective interpretation on who deserves the credit for effective sanctions because many corners of the U.S. government are involved in the Iran effort, said Suzanne Maloney, deputy director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution. But the State Department had its hands in every aspect of new sanction-making and implementation, she said.And in the absence of the United Nations resolution -- Clinton’s lobbying success -- it would have been challenging to get a global coalition to significantly ramp up the sanctions, she said.But whether sanctions were a big factor in bringing Iran to the negotiating table is not crystal clear, Maloney said. Iranian officials have historically denied the significance of sanctions, but Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said recently that Iran negotiated the deal specifically to have sanctions lifted.Beyond the multilateral effort, Clinton’s team also played a role in the sanctions that Congress passed, said Richard Nephew, an expert on sanctions with the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. Lawmakers would not have written that legislation without consulting the State Department and the administration (as evidenced in this 2010 New York Times article ). Nephew noted, though, that Congress did pass some sanctions that went further than the administration’s wishes.""Without Secretary Clinton's good diplomacy -- and the message that she radiated down the system to make this a priority and so forth -- you can argue that the reductions would not have been as steep or as lasting,"" Nephew said.Congress’ sanctions that affect Iran’s oil exports resulted in a 50 percent reduction in oil exports and were instrumental in getting Iran to the negotiating table, said Nephew, who worked at the State Department under Clinton.Our rulingClinton said, ""I spent 18 months putting together the sanctions against Iran so that we could force them to the negotiating table.""Clinton’s claim is for the most part accurate, though a little exaggerated. During her first 18 months as secretary, the State Department was at the helm of a global effort to increase sanctions on Iran, culminating in an important U.N. resolution. Clinton was personally involved in these diplomatic efforts and pushed them publicly. And experts said these sanctions, on top of other sanctions passed before and after, were crucial to getting Iran to the negotiating table.However, Clinton wasn’t singularly responsible for the sanctions, just as the sanctions passed under her watch likely weren’t singularly responsible for opening up Iran to talks.We rate her statement Mostly True.Advertisement"

We wondered whether he was correct.On the Jan. 2, 2011, edition of NBC's Meet the Press, Sen.-elect Pat Toomey, R-Pa., cited a striking statistic in urging the United States to lower its corporate tax rates.Asked by host David Gregory about possible areas where President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans can work together, Toomey suggested several areas, including taxes.""I think tax policy is a possible area, one with plenty of landmines but plenty of opportunities,"" Toomey said . ""Simplify the code, lower rates. We should be lowering corporate tax rates because we have the highest in the world right now."" (Later in the roundtable discussion, Yale Law School professor Stephen Carter repeated the statistic, but we'll check Toomey's quote here.)We wondered whether the U.S. really has the highest corporate tax rates in the world.Using the most straightforward definition of ""corporate tax rates,"" Toomey is right. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 32 large, industrialized democracies, ranks the ""combined corporate income tax rate"" in its member nations. That means the highest tax bracket for general corporate income, excluding taxes levied on specific products or services.For 2010, the U.S ranks second to Japan by a fraction of a percentage point -- 39.54 percent for Japan to 39.21 percent for the U.S. But that figure is already outdated: Japan has recently moved to cut its rate for 2011 by 5 percentage points, leaving the U.S. with the highest corporate tax rate among OECD nations.But before we declare Toomey's statement True, let's dig a little deeper.The OECD rate is the ""statutory"" rate -- that is, the top corporate tax rate on the books. But many companies pay considerably less than that, due to deductions and other exclusions. Adjusting for these factors produces a statistic called the ""effective tax rate.""The World Bank has assembled data from 183 nations and made a series of statistical adjustments to produce a full international comparison of effective tax rates. By this measurement, the U.S. rate is considerably lower than the published rate -- 27.6 percent. But in a comparative sense, that's still pretty high: Among larger international economies, only Japan, New Zealand and Thailand produced a higher effective rate in the World Bank study. And Japan's number should fall by the time next year's study comes out.The World Bank also produces another -- and broader -- statistic. This measure factors in not only the corporate profit tax but also a range of other taxes paid by businesses, including the cost of employee taxes borne by the employer. When the World Bank ranked countries from the lowest level of taxes to the highest, the U.S. ranked 124th out of 183 -- meaning corporate taxes were relatively high. A number of other large and/or democratic countries were higher, including Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Hungary, India, Italy, Spain and Sweden.This last measure provides a wider snapshot of U.S. tax policy toward businesses, but it also introduces some complications. Factoring in the employer-paid portion of labor taxes makes the corporate tax rate seem higher in countries that provide higher benefits such as pensions or health care through business taxes, while making the rate seem lower for countries that provide less generous benefits through the tax code. So making apples-to-apples comparisons can be tricky.There's also broader context that Toomey doesn't get into. In a previous item , we noted that when all taxes, including those such as personal income taxes and property taxes -- not just corporate taxes -- are taken into account and compared to gross domestic product, the U.S. doesn't rank near the top of the OECD table in total tax burden.Still, if you rate Toomey on his specific wording by looking at ""corporate tax rates,"" he's right that the U.S. does now have the highest corporate tax rates on the books, at least among the biggest industrialized democracies, which is most economists' typical yardstick. So we rate his statement Mostly True.Advertisement"

The candidates approach to meeting those goals could not be more different, however. ""Ohio is heading for quite a crisis unfortunately we did not have the focus on job creation in the last session that we should have,"" said incumbent 69th House Representative Bill Batchelder. ""We sent 20 bills addressing job creation and expansion, but we should have been cutting back more on the appropriations level than we were, but as the minority party, we had no control over that."" Batchelder, who has been mentioned as a possible choice for Speaker of the House should the Republicans Party gain control, is serving the second term of his second time in the house. He previ ously served for 30 years up until 2008, when term limits forced him to give up the seat. He has also served as a judge on the Medina County Common Pleas Court and the Ninth District Court of Appeals. Addressing the deficit, which now accounts for roughly 20 percent of the entire state budget, will be a ""huge problem"" facing the next House of Representatives in their first six months, Batchelder said, adding that several tough battles must be waged to meet this goal. He pointed specifically to seeking Federal waiers for participation in the Medicaid program, potentially via offsets for indigent services provided at facilities like MetroHealth Medical Center. ""There are all kinds of things like that which we haven't done a good job of cataloguing,"" Batchelder said. ""And the Federal government has arbitrary authority over granting waivers."" Batchelder also supports looking at the privatization of some medical services now done by public employees. ""Many of these services are now done by people who are being paid higher than those in the private sector,"" Batchelder said. He did not, however, indicate specifically which public-sector jobs he would consider making cuts to, or how many of those jobs would be impacted by such a move. ""We will be holding a lot of hearings and we will have to solve it in six months, when the budget must be in,"" he said. On the growth side of the equation, Batchelder said enhancing the state's Department of Development by encouraging the direct input of participation of business owners is key to job growth. ""We are competing with Indiana and their economy is growing,"" Batchelder said. ""It doesn't help that our Department of Development has been through three or four directors in the same number of years. But we have got to get guys in there from successful businesses who can tell us what they need. National Cash Register is a company that was here for 100 years and now they are in Atlanta shouldn't we find out what companies like that need instead of having the government tell us what they need?"" To provide an immediate shot in the state's economic arm, Batchelder said there should be more of a focus on the needs of industries such as medical and metalworking.""We are starting to see a real philosophical difference between those who feel the government can create jobs and those who feel that only the private sector can,"" Batchelder said. ""These 'green jobs' are generational, they are not something that will be ready next week or even next year. All of these things are planned for the future there are a lot of ribbons being cut but not a lot of production. You can't starve on your way to the green job.""Batchelder said Medina County is particularly poised to play a major role in this short-term recovery focus. ""When we create the jobs, it's also important to have people trained to do them,"" he said. ""So again, we have to find out from the business community what those needs are, then use or facilities such as the Akron University branch and the Medina County Career Center for that training."" That sort of business focus has begun to resonate with an increasingly weary electorate, in Batchelder's view.""I think people are not so much looking for hope and change as nuts and bolts that maybe we need to be more business focused in order to put this economy back together,"" he said. ""We haven't had control of the House for the last two years and it's been malfunctioning, we had 109 session scheduled and held 49."" Batchelder said that in spite of the fact that Ohio is in ""the worst shape since the Depression"" economically, having such a focus will turn around the state's fortunes. ""We need people who will roll up their sleeves to do the legislative work that needs done,"" he said. ""There is no doubt in my mind we are in the position to do that.""

DelReal By Jenna Johnson and Jose A. DelReal Email the author February 20, 2016 Email the author Follow @wpjenna Follow jdelrealThis story has been updated.NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. — To explain his support for waterboarding and other heavy-handed interrogation tactics, Donald Trump told a rally audience a story Friday night that involved U.S. Gen. John J. Pershing, a terrorist attack in the Philippines more than a century ago, 50 terrorists and bullets dipped in pigs’ blood.It’s a tale that has circulated on the Internet for years — and is most likely not true.The story came up as Trump reiterated his support for waterboarding, the advanced interrogation technique that the Obama administration considers torture and has ceased using. Earlier this week, Trump said he supports this controversial method, along with those that are “much worse,” because “torture works.” Proponents of waterboarding have long been careful to not label it as torture, which is strictly forbidden by U.S. and international law.[ Donald Trump: 'Torture works' ]“The big question is: Is it torture or not?” Trump said at a rally at a convention center here, the night before the South Carolina primary. “It’s so borderline. It’s like your minimal, minimal, minimal torture.”Trump criticized his Republican rivals for not embracing waterboarding as enthusiastically as he has, which he says sends the wrong message to terrorists who use barbaric techniques like chopping off the heads of their foes.“You know, I read a story — it’s a terrible story, but I’ll tell you,” Trump said. “Should I tell you? Or should I not?”As the crowd cheered him on, Trump told them about Pershing — “rough guy, rough guy” — who was fighting terrorism in the early 1900s. Trump didn't say where this happened, but variations of this story online usually state that it happened in the Philippines during the Philippine-American War — part of the island nation's protracted battle for independence — early in Pershing’s career.“They were having terrorism problems, just like we do,” Trump said. “And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs’ blood — you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs’ blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn’t a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn’t a problem.”At one point in telling this story, Trump said: “By the way, this is something you can read in the history books — not a lot of history books because they don’t like teaching this.”[ Donald Trump’s final pitch to South Carolina ]Although Trump never used the word “Muslim” in this story, he was clearly referring to Muslim terrorists and at one point commented: “There’s a whole thing with swine and animals and pigs, and — you know the story, you know they don’t like that.” Pigs are deemed impure by the Koran.Trump finished the story with this message: “So we better start getting tough, and we better start getting vigilant, and we better start using our heads, or we’re not going to have a country, folks. We’re not going to have a country.”A guy in the audience then shouted: “This is the greatest country in the world.”While the story was well received by the cheering audience, it appears to be more of a military fable than a history lesson. The website snopes.com — which investigates urban legends, myths, rumors and pretty much anything forwarded in a chain email — could find little proof that the story is true.There are several versions of the tale circulating, including one in which the prisoners were buried with dead pigs. The pigs’ blood on the bullets, according to at least one version, would keep a Muslim from entering heaven.The Council on American-Islamic Relations denounced Trump's remarks Saturday in a sharply worded statement that accused the billionaire of inciting anti-Muslim attacks. The group has frequently tussled with Trump over anti-Muslim rhetoric, including Trump's call to temporary prevent all Muslims from entering the country.""Donald Trump's inflammatory rhetoric has crossed the line from spreading hatred to inciting violence,"" said Nihad Awad, national executive director of CAIR. ""By directly stating that the only way to stop terrorism is to murder Muslims in graphic and religiously-offensive ways, he places the millions of innocent, law-abiding citizens in the American Muslim community at risk from rogue vigilantes.""Republican presidential rival Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) called the story ""bizarre"" and questioned its historical authenticity.""I'm sure people are offended — I hope people are offended by that. That's not what the United States is about,"" Rubio said on NBC's ""Today"" show on Saturday morning. ""Look, we're in a very weird year here. And obviously things are going on, people are saying whatever they want in politics today and there seems to be no accountability.""""The presidency is a serious job … and so I hope we can get this campaign back focused on the serious aspect of it and not the circus aspect of it,"" Rubio added.Trump’s campaign had yet to respond to a request for comment Saturday afternoon.The real estate mogul found himself mired in multiple controversies in the days leading to Saturday's South Carolina primary. On Friday, he called for a boycott of Apple products over the tech firm's refusal to assist the FBI in unlocking an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooters. On Thursday, he had sharp words for Pope Francis after the holy leader seemingly condemned Trump's calls to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.The billionaire tweeted a message Saturday morning that knocked President Obama for not attending Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's funeral — and echoed past statements made by himself and others questioning the president's Christian faith.""I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!"" Trump tweeted. DelReal reported from Greenville, S.C.Jenna Johnson is a White House correspondent of The Washington Post.

Debraccio (ph) is a small government conservative, eager for his voice to be heard in the debate.DEBRACCIO (ph): I want to -- I want to see the state move forward. And in order to do that, many of us in the private sector have had to sacrifice and I think necessary that -- that we all share that sacrifice. It does hit home for me. My wife is a teacher. It's going to cost our family money. But it's the right thing to do, so I support it.WOODRUFF: While Debraccio (ph) was heading to town, chemistry teacher Anthony Schnell (ph) and his family were deep in their morning routine. J. SCHNELL: The immediate effect to our family is that we will make about $500 a month less on Anthony's paycheck. And we are just hanging on by our fingernails right now. My husband loves being a teacher. He's tried other things, and he loves education, he loves kids, he loves working with families. And for him to say I think I might have to leave this again is just heart-breaking, because it's his passion.A. SCHNELL: This isn't about the money. It's not about the benefits. Of course, that's going to hit us, and we don't like that. But it's really about having input in the classes, you know, having input with the school board, having input with what happens.WOODRUFF: Anthony's been coming to the protests all week, but the Tea Party's presence weighed on his mind as he approached the capitol.A. SCHNELL: I'm a little nervous about today. I just don't know what's going happen.WOODRUFF: Once inside the rotunda, he lost the butterflies and began working the crowd.A. SCHNELL: Is this a budget fight?CROWD: No.A. SCHNELL: Is this just about money?CROWD: No.A. SCHNELL: Is this about us doing the best in our classrooms?CROWD: Yes.WOODRUFF (on-screen): They're all saying this is huge. And if it happens here, it's going to happen everywhere in the rest of the country.(voice-over): In the rotunda, there is now a flavor of a '60s- era sit-in. In fact, some told us it's the biggest demonstration they've seen here since the Vietnam War.(on-screen): You doing this every day until this thing -- this bill is killed?OWEN: I think this is going to happen every day until this bill is killed. I don't think there's any way that the people in this building are going to give up the right to collective bargaining.(UNKNOWN): I'm here because this is wrong, that this sort of shotgun legislation, ramming it through, it's the wrong way to deal with problems. This isn't about me. It's about trying to do the best we can for society and communities.WOODRUFF: Do you think it's going to be peaceful? (UNKNOWN): I think so. I think the tensions are going to be high, but I think it's going to stay civil.WOODRUFF: But what if this...(UNKNOWN): Well, wait. Not civil, it's going to stay peaceful.WOODRUFF: Lou Debraccio (ph) got an earful from the pro-labor crowd as he made his way to the Tea Party demonstration.DEBRACCIO (ph): I'm not going to change any of their minds. They're committed enough to drive here and make signs, just like they're not going to change my mind. It's not about that. So there's limited return in talking to them.WOODRUFF: Even some families are divided. Julie Hansen (ph) supports the governor. Her 13-year-old daughter does not.HANSEN (ph): My 13-year-old is for collective bargaining. She went to school yesterday, and the teachers spoke to her about it.WOODRUFF: Think she believes it and -- or just because of the one lesson from the teacher?HANSEN (ph): We had a pretty adamant discussion.WOODRUFF (voice-over): Jeff Strobel (ph) is here with the Tea Party. His brother-in-law is on the other side.STROBEL (ph): And my brother-in-law is a union worker. We had a big e-mail exchange on Facebook last night. The best thing is, it was civil, it was, you know, courteous. But we kind of tried to educate each other, but we're never going to agree. He's on this side; I'm on this side. But we can talk about it.WOODRUFF (on-screen): Still going to have a peaceful Christmas dinner together?STROBEL (ph): As long as there's beer there, we'll be peaceful.WOODRUFF (voice-over): Late Saturday, the governor issued a statement, turning down a compromise offer from the unions. And so here in Wisconsin, the standoff continues, for now.For ""This Week,"" I'm Bob Woodruff in Madison, Wisconsin.(END VIDEOTAPE)AMANPOUR: And so is Wisconsin just the beginning? States from coast to coast are grappling with this fundamental question: In desperate economic times, which Americans should sacrifice the most? I'll put that to the roundtable coming up next.And later, revolt in the Middle East engulfs more of America's strongest allies, with the Obama administration struggling to stay ahead of events. I'll get an exclusive progress report from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: Some of what I've heard coming out of Wisconsin, where you're just making it harder for public employees to collectively bargain generally, seems like more of an assault on unions. And I think it's very important for us to understand that public employees, they're our neighbors, they're our friends. They make a lot of sacrifices and make a big contribution. And I think it's important not to vilify them or to suggest that somehow all these budget problems are due to public employees.(END VIDEO CLIP)AMANPOUR: President Obama igniting a national conversation about which Americans should feel the pain of the budget axe. With pitched battles going on right now here in Washington and in statehouses from Florida to Wisconsin to California, with me now, our roundtable, George Will, Congressman Steve Southerland, a Republican freshman from Florida, he was elected to public office for the very first time last November and sent here to Washington on a mission to cut spending. Also with us, ABC senior political correspondent Jonathan Karl and political strategist Donna Brazile, who calls herself a labor Democrat.Thank you all for being here. So, George, Wisconsin. Is this the sort of battle that we're going to see shaping up around the country? Is this really the sort of political and philosophical debate that's going on right now about what these cuts are going to mean?WILL: It would have been even if the president hadn't intervened. But in the span of three days, Christiane, he first submits a budget that would increase the federal deficit and, two days later, he mobilizes his party, his own political machine, and organized labor, which is an appendage to his party, to sabotage Wisconsin's attempt to do what he will not do, which is deal with the insolvency of their government. In doing so, he has set the stage for 2012 by saying the Democratic Party is the party of government, not just in having an exaggerated view of the scope and competence of government, but because its base is in public employees.AMANPOUR: So, Donna, mobilizing his troops, sabotaging the effort to cut the budget, he did use the word ""assault,"" the president. Is that too much? I mean, what is going on here? BRAZILE: Well, first of all, they're entering day seven of the protests. And my recollection is that President Obama commented on it in day four of the protest. So the fact is, is that this is a grassroots movement that had nothing to do with people or politicians in Washington, D.C. This has everything to do with the workers there in Wisconsin and all across the country who are feeling the effects of these draconian budget cuts.Look, state and local workers have taken the brunt of a lot of these cuts. And they're willing to come to the table to talk to the governor to put forward more wage cuts, more pension -- pay up more money for their pension, more for their health care. Why won't the government sit down with them? That's all they want. They want the governor to sit down with them, to talk about these items, but they want their collective bargaining right, their voice at the table removed from the discussion.AMANPOUR: Is this a defining moment for -- for the labor movement?BRAZILE: Absolutely. Look, union membership is at an all-time low over the previous 20-year high. This is an assault on workers across the country. And people believe that they're using the pretense of a budget battle to destroy collective bargaining rights.AMANPOUR: So, Representative Southerland, a freshman to this process, is this about fiscal responsibility? Or what is happening? Because it's happening in your state, as well.SOUTHERLAND: It is. And as you know, with nearly all of the states requiring a balanced budget amendment, they don't have any choice. The governors have to balance their budget. I know our own governor, Governor Scott, we see similar measures being taken in the state of Florida.And I think you're seeing this in New Jersey, you're seeing this in Wisconsin, so I think that, because they're bound by that limit of a balanced budget -- which I am in favor of at the federal level -- I think that you're going to see this around the country.You -- look, the American family is learning they have to do more with less. And the same expectation, I think, is fair of the governments, both state and federal.AMANPOUR: And, Jon, is it just about the budget? Or is Madison, Wisconsin, have a bigger political implication?KARL: Oh, it clearly has a bigger political implication. Look, the president was quicker and more forceful in his denouncement of Governor Scott Walker than he was of in denouncing Hosni Mubarak. I mean, this happened, it was more forceful, it was quicker.Madison, Wisconsin, the state of Wisconsin, this is arguably ground zero for the 2012 presidential campaign. Look, this is a state that if President Obama loses, he almost certainly is going to not win re-election. This is a state that's been solidly Democratic and (inaudible) more in the direction of Republicans, a bigger move than any other state in 2010.I mean, look what happened. You saw the Republicans capture the governorship, capture the state legislature, two House seats, a Senate seat, and, you know, Democrats see the momentum and see real danger signs for next year.WILL: Governor Walker was elected promising to do what he's doing. He did the same thing as county executive in Milwaukee, where he was -- there were protests, union uprisings, and he was handily re- elected.Donna, as I'm sure you know, such heroes of the labor movement as Franklin Roosevelt and Fiorello La Guardia said there's no place in the public sector for unionization at all. As I'm sure you know, 24 states limit or deny entirely collective bargaining rights for public- sector unions. And all Mr. Scott is planning to do is limit collective bargaining to wages. What is draconian about that?BRAZILE: Well, what these workers would like, George, since they've already given up furloughs, paid leave, unpaid leave, what they would like is -- is to have a voice at the table. They don't want their collective bargaining rights.And, look, what we're talking about is that the governor has cherry-picked what public workers he will subject to this so-called removal of their collective bargaining rights. The firefighters, the policemen and others who supported him in his election bid, well, guess what? They don't have to worry about their collective bargaining rights.Christiane, over 400,000 state and local employees have lost their jobs over -- during the -- the duration of the recession. They are willing -- what we've seen across the country is, these workers are willing to come to the table to talk to these governors about reducing the -- the budget deficit, but not on the backs of working people.AMANPOUR: Let me ask you, because you brought up, George, when the governor was the county executive in Milwaukee. And there's an interesting story today. It -- it boils down, perhaps, as some might say, to sort of shared sacrifice. Where is the sacrifice going to be borne the most? And is it equitable?I just want to ask you, you know, the articles talks about the layoffs that the governor had announced back then, in 2003, quote, ""decimated"" the country's public parks, the staff, reduced the number of county social workers, correction officers, janitors. As a result, park bathrooms shuttered, pools closed, and trash piled up so high. I mean, does it get to a point where too much is too much or not?WILL: And he's re-elected.AMANPOUR: That was my next question.WILL: The public liked what he did.AMANPOUR: OK. All right, well, that's the answer.BRAZILE: They liked what he did in one county. But what you see today is an organic movement. Just like the Tea Party went out there and grabbed the microphone, what you have is grassroots people out there saying, ""No more,"" no more budget cuts on the back of working people. The governor has proposed tax giveaways to corporations. I know he campaigned on that...(CROSSTALK)AMANPOUR: ... but people like Representative Southerland came here to -- to make those massive cuts.SOUTHERLAND: And -- and let me say this about working people. You know, that's not just federal employees. I mean, I come from a small business, and 40 percent of the jobs lost in this recession came from small business, which makes up 85 percent of our economy.So, you know, and I look at the retirement benefits and the benefit packages that most small businesses offer to their employees, and they pale in comparison to -- to many of the federal programs that federal employees have the benefit of. So, you know, I think many people that work in small businesses are depending upon their Social Security as their retirement.(CROSSTALK)WILL: Donna, what you call the grassroots is a tiny minority of this tiny minority of Wisconsin people who work for the government. Three hundred thousand public employees in Wisconsin went to work -- while the teachers were clutching their little signs that say it's all about the kids, they're abandoning their classrooms, lying to their supervisors, saying they were sick, and going off to protest in defense of perquisites, which if the governor cuts them as much as he plans to do, would still leave them better off than their private sector...(CROSSTALK)BRAZILE: But why should workers bear the brunt of this recession? Why are we scapegoating just public-sector employees when, in fact, the -- the folks on Wall Street and others who caused this recession, George, they're enjoying huge bonuses. Bankers are not lending to small businesses, which is why we're not creating the kind of jobs that we need. But we're trying to balance the budgets on the backs of the poor and the middle class, and that's why workers are standing up for their rights.AMANPOUR: And do you think, though, that as some have said this is just an opportunity for union-busting?SOUTHERLAND: Well, you know, I'm not sure if -- if that is -- if that is the focus.AMANPOUR: I mean, some are saying that. But do you think...(CROSSTALK)SOUTHERLAND: I want to say something about, you know, Donna's comments.BRAZILE: Now, remember, you're a freshman.SOUTHERLAND: I remember. I remember. But let me say this...BRAZILE: And I'm your first woman on national TV, other than Christiane. Now, be careful.SOUTHERLAND: But I'm not a freshman at -- at -- at running our small business. And you talk about bankers lending. You know, community banks are being hammered, you know, because they're coming in, they're being taken over. They -- they can't -- they can't loan money, OK? You can't get appraisals. You look at the thrift and how they're coming in and capturing the small banks, and the small banks in our communities are -- are -- are critical to the flavor of our communities. We can't get capital. So I think -- and that's a regulation issue.(CROSSTALK)KARL: But, clearly -- clearly, what Walker is going...SOUTHERLAND: I think we will.KARL: I mean, Walker is going right at the public employee unions. And part of it's because of that experience he had in 2003. He has said that he wouldn't have had to make all those cuts if he could have gotten a better deal with concessions.AMANPOUR: And it's not just Republican governors. It's -- it's some Democrats, as well. Mario Cuomo and others are having to...(CROSSTALK)KARL: But one of the things he's doing is he's saying...BRAZILE: Andrew. Andrew.(CROSSTALK)KARL: Yeah, don't do that. One of the things that he's doing is saying that no longer will union dues be automatically taken out of public employee paychecks, so the unions would have to go out and collect those dues. This is something that's going right at the heart not necessarily of the union employees, but the union leadership.BRAZILE: But the unions want to come to the table.WILL: Because they know what happens.BRAZILE: They want to come to the table, George. They've got 12 percent. They say, here, we want to contribute 12 percent. We want to give you $30 billion for this fiscal year, which ends on June 30th, and over the next two years, $300 million in concessions. Now, you don't walk away from the table or you don't come to the bargaining table when labor is ready to negotiate.AMANPOUR: All right. We're going to continue this after a break. Tea Party revolutionaries on Capitol Hill, Washington braces for a possible government shutdown. The big question: Which side will blink first?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BOEHNER: Our goal here is to cut spending. When we say we're going to cut spending, read my lips: We're going to cut spending.(END VIDEO CLIP)AMANPOUR: House Speaker John Boehner drawing a line in the sand. And sure enough, yesterday the House, with its Tea Party-powered freshmen, passed the biggest spending cut in modern American history.But now it goes to the Democrat-controlled Senate, and it sets up an epic clash of ideas over how to solve a massive budget crisis. And it sets the stage for a possible government shutdown.Joining me once again, George Will, Congressman Steve Southerland of Florida, a conservative freshman elected with Tea Party support, Jonathan Karl, and Donna Brazile.So, you're a man on Capitol Hill. This was the first shot in this big battle over -- over spending cuts. And, really, people like Congressman Southerland showed their muscle.KARL: This is the Tea Party's moment. I mean, imagine this. We are talking not only about cutting government spending -- Washington has never really done that -- but we're talking about how much.I mean, even the Democrats -- even Nancy Pelosi came out with -- with a measure that would continue government funding temporarily, freezing it at last year's level. That is what Democrats traditionally would call a cut, because you're not going with inflation. So this is -- this is really a moment. This is also the Chris Christie phenomenon. Will politicians be rewarded for making tough choices, again, something I don't think we've ever seen happen?AMANPOUR: Do you care about being rewarded about tough choices?SOUTHERLAND: Well, I think the American people are ready. They recognize the brutal reality that we're broke. And -- and -- and you're seeing that. We just talked in the last segment about the state level, and it certainly applies here.We've seen record deficits. And the budget that the president, you know, introduced this past week just continues to put the pedal to the metal. So, I mean, we're talking about this year alone, we're at a $1.5 trillion deficit. And, you know, we talk about draconian measures of the C.R., but that draconian is leaving our children with debt that smothers them.AMANPOUR: Right. But in the real world, what happens if this doesn't get past the Senate or past the president? Then what?SOUTHERLAND: Well, look, we -- I'm not -- I'm not naive to the -- to the fact that when it goes to the Senate, they're going to make their -- their changes, and then it's got to go to the president. So, you know, it will not be in the form that we produced yesterday morning at 5 a.m. when we left the House being on the floor all night.AMANPOUR: So you're prepared for maybe half that figure?SOUTHERLAND: Well, I'm interested. I'm eager to see what's going to happen. I don't -- I don't know what's going to happen. But I don't expect it's going to be in the same form that we produced yesterday morning.AMANPOUR: Where is this going, George? Everybody, of course, talks about government shutdown or not. Some do.WILL: Well, that's premature. The Democratic senators have to decide, as does the president, whether they want to spend the next two years blocking in the Senate or vetoing on the president's desk spending bills because they're too small, because they believe the government isn't spending enough.The Democratic senators have to decide if, out of a $15 trillion economy, the economy is going to be hurt by cutting $60 billion from the federal budget. They have to decide whether, out of a $3.7 trillion budget, there isn't $60 billion of inessential spending.AMANPOUR: But it's still the hugest proposed cut. Who's going to blink first, Donna? You've been briefed. And I know you've been talking to -- to leadership about these matters.BRAZILE: This is very difficult. And we all recognize that we have to begin to cut spending. As Jonathan mentioned, the House Democrats, the Senate Democrats, the president has submitted a budget, the 2012 budget, that -- that will slow the rate of growth and bring down the federal deficit to 3 percent of GDP by 2015. Yeah, President Obama has a little bit of fiscal conservativism in him.But the point is, is that this is primal scream politics; $61 billion at the current spending levels is draconian. It cuts essential, vital, necessary services.George, it's people -- it's students who are in college right now with Pell Grants that will have to face significant cuts. It's -- it's preschoolers in Head Start that may not be able to go to school on the morning after May 4th, if we don't continue with the continuing resolution at 2010 levels.So I think this is draconian. It's bad for the country. It's bad for the economy. And it slows down economic growth at a time when things are finally moving up.AMANPOUR: And, Jon, do you think it's going to lead to a shutdown?KARL: Well, it might. I think there's a real possibility of that. I can tell you this: John Boehner has been telling people privately, his Republican colleagues, that he will not allow a government shutdown. But the question is, will he be able to -- you know, to produce?Here's the time line, though, is -- is that they just did this. The House and the Senate are gone for the next week. They have four days when they get back to work out some kind of an agreement. And if they don't do it by the end of the four days, we are at a government shutdown.AMANPOUR: So what's going to happen? What sort of pressure -- are you going to put on the speaker?SOUTHERLAND: Well, I think -- I think, the Republicans, we have no desire to have a government shutdown. I think that Speaker Boehner has been very, very clear. I think that he wanted to produce a bill that was legitimate. We saw over the last five days -- we saw the first C.R. that went through open rules. We had over 500 amendments. We voted on 70. And it was amazing to see the process, to see Democrats voting with Republicans on amendments. I mean, the will of the floor...KARL: But are your colleagues going to go along with something that doesn't cut spending?SOUTHERLAND: It's going have to cut spending.(CROSSTALK)KARL: See, that's...SOUTHERLAND: Look, I -- I mean, we're going have to cut spending. I think...BRAZILE: But the appropriation chair came up with $30 billion in spending cuts. And then the House can -- the ultra-conservatives -- I have no other way of describing you -- you guys decided that you needed $30 billion more.(CROSSTALK)AMANPOUR: ... the politics of a shutdown, it sunk Newt Gingrich. Would it sink Speaker Boehner?WILL: It would do anyone any good on either side. But our viewers can do the arithmetic. They can take $60 billion for $3.7 trillion. And if that's draconian, what wouldn't be draconian?BRAZILE: But, George, we're talking about over the next seven months. We've got -- we've got food safety workers that will be impacted. We have people who will be impacted across the board.WILL: This budget includes $7,500 bribes for anyone who will buy a Chevrolet Volt.(CROSSTALK)AMANPOUR: ... will be...BRAZILE: ... the Metro. We're going to need to get the bicycle out, George.AMANPOUR: You can carry on your challenges in the green room, where the roundtable will continue.And we turn next to the Middle East, as people-powered revolutions sweeps the region. I ask Hillary Clinton what it means for the United States. My exclusive interview, when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)AMANPOUR: In the Middle East overnight, the popular uprising sweeping the region have taken their most violent turn yet. It happened in Libya. Protesters there have been calling for the removal of the strong man, Moammar Gadhafi, for the last five days. He's been in power for more than 40 years. And eyewitnesses are reporting that the military has now been firing on protesters after gaining their confidence and being welcomed into the crowd. A doctor gave a dramatic radio interview. Let's listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(UNKNOWN): Oh, my god. They're firing on the civilians here. They're crazy. They're going crazy here.(END VIDEO CLIP)AMANPOUR: There are reports of hundreds dead and thousands injured in Libya.In Yemen this morning, thousands marched again in the streets of the capital, Sana'a. The president, an important American ally in the war on terror, blamed the unrest on a foreign plot.And in Bahrain, home to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, which protects crucial oil-shipping lanes, demonstrators retook the square where their calls for reform have now given way to calls for the king to step down.Bahrain, of course, is also a logistical hub and command center for U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. And last night, in a 180-degree turn, the crown prince offered to open up a dialogue with the protesters. ABC's Miguel Marquez is there.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARQUEZ: Christiane, it is amazing, the difference that 24 hours makes. This time yesterday, this country appeared poised for civil war; now it is a celebration down here at Pearl Square, as you can see. And it appears we're headed for a negotiated political settlement.In order the get the settlement they want, these protesters are now willing to stay for the long haul. You can see they've set up tents all the way around Pearl Square here. They're even serving food out here. That tea, by the way, is called Freedom Tea, and they are very organized. This area over here is the men's section. And then right back here, all these people in black, that's the women's section.The big question is, what will get these protesters to go home? They want a constitutional democracy. They want the king to back off of politics and become a figurehead. They want the prime minister, who's been in power for 40 years, to go home. But so much blood has been spilled here in the past week, these protesters want a significant deal. Will they get it? It's not clear. It's not clear what will get them to stop protesting, pack up their tents, and go home.Christiane?(END VIDEO CLIP)AMANPOUR: And we'll keep watching Bahrain and the other uprisings.President Obama has called Bahrain's king -- he did that on Friday -- urging him to respect the rights of the protesters. The administration once again finds itself in a bit of a bind, as freedom activists face off against an authoritarian ally.Secretary of State Hillary Clinton walked a fine line when I spoke to her exclusively on Friday.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)AMANPOUR: Madame Secretary, thank you for joining us.CLINTON: Thank you for having me.AMANPOUR: About Bahrain.CLINTON: Uh-huh.AMANPOUR: How do you assess Bahrain right now? Is it stable?CLINTON: You know, Christiane, we've been very clear from the beginning that we do not want to see any violence. We deplore it. We think it is absolutely unacceptable.We very much want to see the human rights of the people protected, including right to assemble, right to express themselves, and we want to see reform. And so Bahrain had started on some reform, and we want to see them get back to that as quickly as possible. AMANPOUR: What will the United States do? And will it hold Bahrain to a similar standard, as it did Egypt?CLINTON: We -- we try to hold everyone to a similar standard, but we cannot dictate the outcomes. We cannot tell countries what they're going to do. We had, you know, no control over what happened in Egypt.AMANPOUR: As Americans sit and watch and try to make sense of what's going on in the Arab Muslim world, is what's happening -- is the emerging new order, is it good for America? What should Americans make of it?CLINTON: Well, I think, in general, Americans are in favor of human rights, freedom, democracy. We know that ultimately the most progress that can be made on behalf of human beings anywhere is when those individuals are empowered, when they have governments that are responsive. That's what we want to see.At the same time, we recognize that this process can be hijacked. It can be hijacked by both outside and inside elements within any country. I mean, what a tragedy to see what happened in Iran. There was a great deal of hope and pent-up feeling that the time had come in 1979, and look at what Iran is doing today.AMANPOUR: You want democracy. You speak about democracy. Can you control democracy? Should you control democracy? Or do you have to take the chips and let them fall where they may if you want democracy?CLINTON: Well, I think that, first, we have to start from the basic premise as to what democracy means, and democracy is not one election that then whoever wins it decides never to have another one.That is not what anyone wants. We want to work with those forces within societies that are yearning for change to make sure that they have the support needed and, frankly, the technical assistance, the financial assistance to be able to make it through to what is a good outcome, what they've asked for in their online blogs and in their posters and in their interviews.AMANPOUR: I want to ask you this, because it's an in-depth interview that you've done in Bazaar. It's a beautiful layout. I'm struck by the imagery, though. You are there, beautiful, but in a corner.CLINTON: You know, I just do what photographers tell me to do. It has no metaphorical meaning for me.(LAUGHTER)AMANPOUR: But I wanted to ask you, do you feel in a corner right now or on a tight rope, trying to balance the need for stability in countries where you have allies and interests, and your values, wanting democracy and all the human rights for the people there? Is that a struggle? CLINTON: Well, I think it is a challenge. And it is a challenge not only at this point of time in the Middle East; it is an inherent challenge in diplomacy, in America's efforts in the world. We want to advance our security, our values, and our interests. And if there were one template that could be imposed on every situation, I wouldn't need to have this job, and nobody else would have to, either. But this is often a balancing act and...AMANPOUR: Do you feel you're at a turning point, at a sort of a tectonic shift in trying to figure out where the balance is, where your strategic interests lie?CLINTON: Well, Christiane, we deal with, you know, so many countries around the world, some of whom are closer to our values, who see their interests in ways we do and some of who -- whom are on the opposite end of the spectrum.AMANPOUR: In the Middle East, America's strategic interests have been with some of these autocratic rulers. They've helped you with Israel and peace in the region. They've helped you against terrorism. Do you believe that a democratic people could be a force for much more stability, longer-term stability?CLINTON: Well, ultimately, a really truly functioning, comprehensive democracy has historically been proven to be a greater force for stability. Navigating through what are difficult choices for societies that are doing that transition is something that the United States encourages, as we did after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and will continue to encourage. At the same...AMANPOUR: So here, will you be encouraging it here?CLINTON: Well, we have been. But at the same time, we are also knowledgeable enough about historical experiences to know that this is not an easy journey for any people to make. There are many threats and problems along the way.AMANPOUR: It is beyond dispute that the Obama administration scaled back their democracy and freedom agenda of the Bush administration. In Egypt, the funds for NGOs and the like, civil society, democracy-building, were cut back and furthermore were directed, when they were directed, to NGOs that were supported by the Mubarak regime. Was that a mistake?Clinton: Well, first of all, I just reject the premise. I think that there is...AMANPOUR: It's -- it's indisputable.CLINTON: Well, it's not. That's just not -- that's just not the case. There were differences in approach under the same set of goals to try to promote democracy, economic opportunity, women's rights, labor organizing. There are many different ways that I think all of us, different administrations, different experts, have struggled with.There is no debate that, for 30 years, Republican and Democratic administrations alike sent the same message to President Mubarak and the regime, that they had to change. And we were all trying different ways.You know, I think it's fair to say that none of us were particularly successful, because we kept running into an absolute rejection that that was not going to be done in Egypt. But we tried many different approaches, and we're going to try many different approaches in different settings, as well.AMANPOUR: The State Department just had an Arabic Twitter account, a Farsi Twitter account. This week, what do you expect to do with that?CLINTON: Have you -- have you been following the Farsi Twitter account?AMANPOUR: I'm following it all.CLINTON: Excellent. Excellent. Well, what we expect to do is to be communicating through the new social media with literally millions of people around the world, because we want them to hear directly from us what our policies are. We want to use it to rebut some of the falsehoods and accusations that, unfortunately, are made against the United States.But mostly we want to be in the mix with this incredible, young, energetic population that is seeking the same rights to express themselves as young people in the United States seek.AMANPOUR: Thank you very much.CLINTON: Thank you very much.(END VIDEOTAPE)AMANPOUR: And this week, Secretary Clinton called on governments around the world to respect and promote free access to the Internet. And when we return, we'll take you inside the revolution with the anonymous online revolutionaries who launched a movement.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)AMANPOUR: As we now know, behind the wave of uprisings in the Middle East is a generation of educated, Internet-savvy, young Arab professionals. And their weapons? Social media, mostly made in America, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook. In the darkest days of the protests in Egypt, two anonymous activists kept the online movement alive.This week, they agreed to tell us the gripping story of their fight for freedom, which was not with tanks, but with tech.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)AMANPOUR (voice-over): Incredibly, one of the key players in the online youth movement that helped bring down Hosni Mubarak was a 34- year-old Egyptian-American who never left Washington.WAHAB: I had contacts on the ground. People were asking me to get messages to them. People would turn to me and be like, ""What should we do?"" And I'd be like, ""Well, I don't know. I never started a revolution before.""AMANPOUR: A year ago, Nadine Wahab connected online with the young Google marketing executive and anti-government activist Wael Ghonim.GHONIM: They are basically a bunch of thugs, thieves, and, you know, who have been ruining their -- our country. They're so 1970, and we're so 2010.AMANPOUR: They'd been trying to mobilize demonstrations through Facebook since June of last year. And at first, the protests were small. But on January 25th, they posted this page calling for a protest that mushroomed into a full-scale revolt. How?A week earlier, not so far way in Tunisia, young people had forced out their authoritarian president. They had also taken advantage of an explosion of social media that in just the last four years has electrified the Arab and Muslim world.(on-screen): Is this explosion of technology, the access among so many people, is this the reason for these revolutions and uprisings that are going on, the turmoil?GHOSH: It's a planning tool, an organizing tool. AMANPOUR (voice-over): Bobby Ghosh has been reporting on the youth movement for this week's Time magazine and says it's been key to spreading revolutionary fervor.GHOSH: So Tunisians can talk to Egyptians. Egyptians can talk to Yemenis. And it shows them that they're not alone.AMANPOUR: Arab satellite television also played a role. Electrified by what happened in Tunis, young Egyptians used Facebook to call for a protest in Tahrir Square.GHONIM: I put out an event and say, if 100,000 people confirm in three days, then I'm going to take this seriously and, you know, try and make it 1 million.AMANPOUR: Wael Ghonim blogged anonymously. So did his friend, Ahmed Saleh, a young lawyer, and they exchanged key tactical advice online.SALEH: On pages, on personal accounts, on groups that have very specific instructions from Tunisians to Egyptians. And so it gives you instructions on how to deal with the tear gas, on how to deal with police generally, what the times of the day is better for you to go to the street, how to deal with rubber bullets.AMANPOUR: The Facebook page became their corner cafe, the place to meet, to recruit and share ideas.SALEH: One of the ideas that we're still trying to trace where it had originated was -- is the idea to go to popular areas and bring people from the popular areas to specific public squares.AMANPOUR: After a week of protests, the Mubarak regime shut down the Internet. Wael was arrested, but he had already made a plan to preserve the online movement.SALEH: In case he disappears or anything, I should take over the page. If he's arrested, it's very expected that he would be investigated and tortured. So if the page had stopped working at the time, that would be sort of incriminating for him.AMANPOUR: Half a world away, Nadine had set up a makeshift war room in a D.C. townhouse.WAHAB: When the Internet went down is when my world sort of turned topsy-turvy. It became surreal.AMANPOUR: They were determined to keep the page up and running.WAHAB: People would tell me, ""Nadine, they're not going to come for you here."" But I was terrified. When I was at night by myself, I was terrified.AMANPOUR: At the same time in Cairo, Ahmed also continued the work Wael had started. SALEH: When I wake up early in the morning, I post five or six posts or as many as I could in very short time, couple of hours, and then I post one sentence that says, ""I'm going to Tahrir.""AMANPOUR: But even they were stunned when Wael was released and Hosni Mubarak stepped aside.GHONIM: I'm proud to be an Egyptian since I've seen all these, you know, heroes in the street doing all these things that I never thought Egyptians would do. And, you know -- you know, in -- in 15 days, Egyptians learned what does it mean to me to involve in politics and call for their rights.AMANPOUR: That moment emboldened a movement across the Middle East, filled with young people who now believe they can break the grip of repressive regimes, armed with something as simple as a cell phone.(on-screen): How wired is the whole region?GHOSH: It's quite substantially wired. Even people who you would say are quite poor, live in the old city and 20 people to a small home, they have a cell phone that -- it'll have a camera. If they can afford it, it'll have sort of e-mail service or an Internet connection.AMANPOUR (voice-over): In Bahrain, the protesters in Pearl Square have makeshift charging stations for that vital weapon against oppression.(UNKNOWN): It plays a big role, OK, in gathering people and giving them instructions. Go here. Not go. Don't go there. OK, this place is dangerous. Don't try to attack policemen.AMANPOUR: In Yemen, Allah Jaban (ph) is helping to mobilize young people by posting a few simple photos on Facebook.(UNKNOWN): Those people who go out and demonstrate, they're young people, out there just to -- to ask the better for their countries and ask for their rights.AMANPOUR: Thousands turned out and forced their president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to take back his plan to make himself president for life. Watching this wave reach its borders, Saudi Arabia is desperately trying to contain it. It set up a Facebook page where the chief of the royal court encourages you to post your complaint directly. And if you fax it in, they guarantee a response within 24 hours.In Iran, despite the government's attempts to block it, 90 percent of the hits on this Facebook page still come from Iran.(on-screen): The people who are doing this, are these people who are friendly to the United States?GHONIM: They are suspicious of the United States, most of them, their entire lives. But they're not viscerally anti-American. We're not seeing flags being -- American flags being burnt. We're not seeing the American president or -- or Hillary Clinton being hung in effigy. And so if the U.S. is able to conduct some smart diplomacy, I think it's possible to get over that hump of suspicion that they have.AMANPOUR (voice-over): The Egyptian revolution wasn't driven just by the Internet and its super users, like Wael, Nadine and Ahmed, but by forces that have sparked revolution throughout history, the fight for basic freedom that connects us all.SALEH: The experience and the inspiration has no borders.WAHAB: It was much bigger than any of us, and it showed a -- a different model other than violence. You saw a people come together in a way that was just wonderful.GHOSH: The dream became true. And, you know, whatever we've been fighting for since the 25th of January is now being realized.(END VIDEOTAPE)AMANPOUR: And I'll continue to follow the unfolding events in the Middle East in real time on Twitter and on my blog, my Facebook page, or at abcnews.com.We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)AMANPOUR: That's it for our program this week. Stay with ABC News and abcnews.com for all the very latest on the uprisings in the Middle East and the budget crisis here in Washington and around the country. Thank you for joining us.

They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees."""	mostly true	['Taxes']	https://www.washingtonpost.com/	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/01/14/6th-republican-debate-transcript-annotated-who-said-what-and-what-it-meant/	2016/01/26	"6th Republican debate transcript, annotated: Who said what and what it meantBy Team Fix By Team Fix January 14, 2016Here are the key moments from the debate that brought Republican presidential candidates head-to-head in North Charleston, S.C. on Jan. 14. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)Seven candidates participated in Thursday's 2016 presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C.: Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), Ohio Gov. John Kasich and New Jersey governor Chris Christie.The complete transcript is posted below. Washington Post reporters and readers using Genius have annotated it, and will continue to do so following the debate.To see an annotation, click or tap the highlighted part of the transcript; if you would like to leave your own annotations, make sure you have a Genius account . Post staff annotations will appear by default; others are in a menu that you can see in the upper right when you click or tap on an annotation.The debate began after moderators Neil Cavuto and Maria Bartiromo introduced the candidates.BARTIROMO: So let's get started. Candidates, jobs and growth -- two of the biggest issues facing the country right now. In his State of the Union address earlier this week, the president said, quote, ""we have the strongest, most durable economy in the world.""And according to our Facebook research, jobs is one of the biggest issues resonating across the country, including here in South Carolina. The president is touting 14 million new jobs and an unemployment rate cut in half.The president said that anyone who claims America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction. Senator Cruz, what do you see that he doesn't?CRUZ: Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something. Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran. President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei. And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)Now, on to your substantive question. The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs. And you know, he's right. If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great. The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama. But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977. Median wages have stagnated. And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Kasich, we are not even two weeks into this stock trading year, but (inaudible) investors already lost $1.6 trillion in market value. That makes it the worst start to a new year ever. Many worry that things will get even worse, and that banks and financial stocks are particularly vulnerable.Now, if this escalates, like it did back when Barack Obama first assumed the presidency, what actions would you take if this same thing happens all over again just as, in this example, you are taking over the presidency?KASICH: Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs. And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt. And our economy was growing like crazy. It's the same thing that I did in Ohio. It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety. It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way. And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline. We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget. And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high. You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses. They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people. And I mean, are you kidding me? We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise. You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy. And how do I know it? Because I've done it. I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici. And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.Our wages are growing faster than the national average. We're running surpluses. And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: We know that recent global events have many people worried -- Iran detaining American sailors, forcing them to apologize; North Korea and its nuclear ambitions; an aggressive China; and a Middle East that continues to deteriorate, not to mention ISIS is getting stronger.Governor Christie, sometimes it seems the world is on fire. Where and when should a president use military action to restore order?CHRISTIE: Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world. Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama. And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?(APPLAUSE)The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess. The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world. And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.CHRISTIE: Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood. And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience. And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right. It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight. If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.I will not do that. If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Just to be clear Governor, where and when would you use military action?CHRISTIE: Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world. We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either. We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships. It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Bush, the president just told the nation two nights ago that America is back and that the idea that our enemies are getting stronger or that this country is getting weaker, well, it's just rhetoric and hot air. Now other Democrats go even further, sir, saying Republicans even suggesting such comments actually embolden our enemies. I guess they would include you. What do you say?BUSH: Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe. The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.Think about it. With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists. He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.(APPLAUSE)I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military. In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force. Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well. Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military. We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: So I take it from that you do not agree with the president.BUSH: No. And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.Think about it. She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess. And that is wrong.And you know what? Here's the problem. If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now. If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse. We need to stop that. (LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Senator Rubio, the president says that ISIS doesn't threaten our national existence like a Germany or a Japan back in World War II, that the terror group is nothing more than twisted souls plotting attacks in their garages.But House Homeland Security Committee recently said that over 1,000 ongoing investigations of homegrown extremism in 50 states. So how do you define the threat? Germany then or dangerous nut cases now?RUBIO: Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton. She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.(APPLAUSE)Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States. Ever.(APPLAUSE)On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power. Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size. And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS. He consistently underestimates it but I do not. There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS. The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them. And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Thank you, Senator.BARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, the president says he does not want to treat ISIS as a foreign army, but ISIS is neither a country nor a government. How do you attack a network that does not respect national borders?CARSON: Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on. I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.(LAUGHTER)You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations. The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before. Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid. And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously. And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.I mean, just think about a scenario like that. They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse. They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs. Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point? He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.But here's the real key. We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it. And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Mr. Trump, at the State of the Union, the president pointed to a guest who was a Syrian refugee you might recall whose wife and daughter and other family members were killed in an air attack. Now he fled that country seeking asylum here, ultimately ended up in Detroit where he's now trying to start a new life.The president says that that doctor is the real face of these refugees and not the one that you and some of your colleagues on this stage are painting; that you prefer the face of fear and terror and that you would refuse to let in anyone into this country seeking legitimate asylum. How do you answer that?TRUMP: It's not fear and terror, it's reality. You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.(APPLAUSE)You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow. They're very, very badly wounded. They will -- some will follow. And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.That could be the great Trojan Horse. It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction. When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women? It looked like very few women. Very few children. Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?TRUMP: You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have. We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders. We can't do it.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, the New York Times is reporting that you failed to properly disclose a million dollars in loans from Goldman Sachs and CitiBank. During your senate race, your campaign said, ""it was inadvertent."" A million dollars is inadvertent?CRUZ: Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times. You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views. The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, ""Anybody But Cruz."" Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, ""It Follows"" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships. Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars. When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars. He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks. And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing. But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other. But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.BARTIROMO: Thank you.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: All right. Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate, right here in North Charleston, South Carolina. Let's get right back to the questions. And I'll start with you, Senator Cruz.Now you are, of course, a strict constitutionalist -- no one would doubt that. And as you know, the U.S. Constitution says only natural-born citizens are eligible for the office of president of the United States. Stop me if you've heard this before. Now, you were born...(LAUGHTER)... you were born in Canada to an American mother. So you were and are considered an American citizen. But that fellow next to you, Donald Trump -- and others -- have said that being born in Canada means you are not natural-born, and that has raised questions about your eligibility.Do you want to try to close this topic once and for all tonight?CRUZ: Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there. There was nothing to this birther issue.(LAUGHTER)Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.(LAUGHTER)But the poll numbers have.(APPLAUSE)And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa. But the facts and the law here are really quite clear. Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland. She was naturalized. Now, Donald...TRUMP: But I was born here.CRUZ: ... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...TRUMP: (inaudible). Big difference.CRUZ: ... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.TRUMP: OK, good. Because it wouldn't work.CRUZ: You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: ... that you raised it because of his rising poll numbers.TRUMP: ... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down. I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...(BOOING)... they don't like the Wall Street Journal. They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.(LAUGHTER)And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you. So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.(APPLAUSE)You don't have to say that. In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.TRUMP: Number two, this isn't me saying it. I don't care. I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way. Thank you.Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this. OK? There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.Here's the problem. We're running. We're running. He does great. I win. I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride. I don't like that. OK?(LAUGHTER)The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible). See, they don't like that. They don't like that.(AUDIENCE BOOING)No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.(LAUGHTER)But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit. You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running. And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office? So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide. And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: Why are you saying this now -- right now? Why are you raising this issue now?TRUMP: Because now he's going a little bit better. No, I didn't care (inaudible). It's true. No, it's true. Hey look, he never had a chance. Now, he's doing better. He's got probably a four or five percent chance.(LAUGHTER)CRUZ: Neil...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: The fact is, there is a big overhang. There's a big question mark on your head. And you can't do that to the party. You really can't. You can't do that to the party. You have to have certainty. Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run. If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit. I promise. But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty. You can't have a question. I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.CAVUTO: Senator, do you want to respond?CRUZ: Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court. And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.TRUMP: You don't have to. Take it from Lawrence Tribe.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Take it from your professors...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero. And Mr. Trump is very focused...TRUMP: He's wrong. He's wrong.CRUZ: ... on Larry Tribe. Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is. He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore. He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter. And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...TRUMP: He is not the only one.CRUZ: ... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.TRUMP: There are many lawyers.CRUZ: And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P. slot.(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what. If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P. So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.TRUMP: No -- no...... I think if it doesn't...(APPLAUSE)I like that. I like it. I'd consider it. But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.CRUZ: Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: Let me (inaudible). I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.(LAUGHTER)But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about. OK? Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind. But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America. He wants to change America. We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution. He undermines it. We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage. We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.This election has to be about reversing all of that damage. That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders. When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military. And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world. When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.BARTIROMO: Thank you, senator.BARTIROMO: Mr. Trump, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in her response to the State of the Union address(APPLAUSE)BARITROMO: appeared to choose sides within the party, saying Republicans should resist, quote, ""the siren call of the angriest voices"". She confirmed, she was referring to you among others. Was she out of line? And, how would a President Trump unite the party?TRUMP: Okay. First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers. Actually a close friend. And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend. We're friends. That's good.(LAUGHTER)But she did say there was anger. And I could say, oh, I'm not angry. I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger. Our military is a disaster.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Our healthcare is a horror show. Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it. We have no borders. Our vets are being treated horribly. Illegal immigration is beyond belief. Our country is being run by incompetent people. And yes, I am angry.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry. And I say that to Nikki. So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended. She said the truth.One of your colleagues interviewed me. And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right. I'm not fighting that. I didn't find it offensive at all. I'm angry because our country is a mess.(APPLAUSE)BARITROMO: But what are you going to do about it?CAVUTO: Marco Rubio. I'm sorry, it's the time constraints. You and Governor Christie have been exchanging some fairly nasty words of late, and I will allow the governor to respond as well.The governor went so far to say, you won't be able to slime your way to the White House. He's referring to a series of ads done by a PAC, speaking on your behalf, that say quote,""One high tax, Common Core, liberal, energy-loving, Obamacare, Medicaid-expanding president is enough. You think you went too far on that and do you want to apologize to the governor?RUBIO: You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...CAVUTO: That is not my question.RUBIO: Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil. He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government. This president is undermining our military. He is undermining our standing in the world. I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control. This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood. All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country. It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary. Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America. We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage. No one is a socialist. No one here is under FBI investigation. So we have a good group of people.CAVUTO: Is he a liberal?RUBIO: Our next president...CAVUTO: Is he a liberal?RUBIO: Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood. Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.CAVUTO: Governor?(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.(LAUGHTER)So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then. So let's set the facts straight. First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor. Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban. I have vetoed a reduction this clip size. I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey. So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator. See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk. And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do. And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: And the last piece is this. I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed. That was before he was running against me. Now that he is, he's changed his tune.I'm never going to change my tune. I like Marco Rubio. He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Neil, my name was mentioned here. Neil, my name was mentioned as well.Here's the deal, Chris is totally right. He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton. And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.These attack ads are going to be part of life. Everybody just needs to get used to it. Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.(APPLAUSE)Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.CARSON: Neil, I was mentioned too.CAVUTO: You were?CARSON: Yeah, he said everybody. (LAUGHTER)And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it. And we got to look at the big picture here.BARTIROMO: Governor Kasich...(APPLAUSE)... Governor Kasich, Hillary Clinton is getting some serious competition from Senator Bernie Sanders. He's now at 41 percent in the latest CBS/New York Times poll. Vice President Biden sang his praises, saying Bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real, and he has credibility on it.So what does it say about our country that a candidate who is a self-avowed socialist and who doesn't think a 90 percent tax rate is too high could be the Democratic nominee?KASICH: Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee. That's not even an issue. But look...(APPLAUSE)... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States. So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need. Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.People are upset about it. I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn. Do we have answer for that? We do. There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.I'll tell you what else people are concerned about. Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job. We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.(APPLAUSE)Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future. They're very concerned about it. And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.That's not the America that I've ever known. My father used to say, ""Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich. We just want to be the rich."" And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.I'm president -- look, I've done it once. I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes. The economy was really booming.And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average. A growth of 385,000 jobs.(BELL RINGS)It's not that hard. Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts. Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done. And, folks, we will. You count on it.BARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, one of the other candidates on this stage has brought Bill Clinton's past indiscretions. Is that a legitimate topic in this election? And what do you think of the notion that Hillary Clinton is an enabler of sexual misconduct?CARSON: Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means. But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore? Do we still have standards? Do we still have values and principles?You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society. You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars. Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names. Where did that spirit come from in America? It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that. And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong. And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great. They've been beaten into submission. It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Well, we are not done. Coming up, one of the top things people are talking about on Facebook, guns. And you can join us live us on this stage in the conversation during this commercial break right from home. You can go to Facebook.com/(inaudible). We will be streaming live and talking about how we think the debate is going so far.CAVUTO: We're back in a moment in Charleston, South Carolina.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debates, right here in North Charleston. Let's get right back to the questions.Governor Bush, gun rights, one of the top issues seen on Facebook with close to 3 million people talking about it in the past month. Right here in Charleston, Dylann Roof, who has been accused of killing nine people in a nearby church, reportedly had not passed his background check when he got his gun. What is the harm in tightening standards for not only who buys guns, but those who sell them?BUSH: First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --(APPLAUSE)BUSH: The Emanuel AME church killings. And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place. Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake. The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job. Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check. The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is. It isn't law-abiding gun owners.Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away. You're going away for a long, long while.And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities. Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.The other issue is mental health. That's a serious issue that we could work on. Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have. Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.Mr. Trump, are there any circumstances that you think we should be limiting gun sales of any kind in America?TRUMP: No. I am a 2nd amendment person. If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead. So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.We have a huge mental health problem in this country. We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money. We have to get back into looking at what's causing it. The guns don't pull the trigger. It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order. He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress. You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation. He just writes out an executive order. Not supposed to happen that way.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you sir.XXX where you get Congress.TRUMP: You get the Congress. You get the Senate. You get together. You do legislation. He just writes out an order, executive order. It's not supposed to happen that way.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Senator Rubio, you said that President Obama wants to take people's guns away. Yet under his presidency, gun sales have more than doubled. That doesn't sound like a White House unfriendly to gun owners.RUBIO: That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.(APPLAUSE)Look, the Second Amendment is not an option. It is not a suggestion. It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families. I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would. I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would. I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.Here's my second problem. None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive. You know why? Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show. They don't buy their guns from a collector. And they don't buy their guns from a gun store. They get -- they steal them. They get them on the black market.And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show. These...(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)... his answer -- you name it. If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control. Here's a fact. We are in a war against ISIS. They are trying to attack us here in America. They attacked us in Philadelphia last week. They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago. And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: But what fact can you point to, Senator -- what fact can you point to that the president would take away everyone's gun? You don't think that's (inaudible)?RUBIO: About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns. He has never defended...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: I'll give you a fact. Well, let me tell you this. Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, ""These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."" That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.(APPLAUSE)He doesn't meet -- here's the difference. When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not ""how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."" It's ""give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."" That will never happen when I am president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Christie, you, too, have criticized the president's recent executive action on gun control, saying it's unconstitutional, another step to bypass Congress. But hasn't your own position on guns evolved, sir? The New Jersey Star-Ledger reports that you signed several laws to regulate the possession of firearms, and that you argued back in August 2013, and I quote, ""These common sense measures will strengthen New Jersey's already tough gun laws.""So isn't that kind of what the president wants to do now?CHRISTIE: No, absolutely not. The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people. And the fact is that that's not a democracy. That's a dictatorship. And we need to very, very concerned about that.See, here's the thing. I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident. I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat. I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit. We have made it easier to do that, not harder. And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders. This guy is a petulant child. That's what he is. I mean, you know...(APPLAUSE)... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.Mr. President, we're not against you. We're against your policies. When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate. You had only 21 Republican governors in this country. And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it. That's not right. It's not constitutional. And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: So what is the answer, Senator Cruz, to stop mass shootings and violent crime, up in 30 cities across the country?CRUZ: The answer is simple. Your prosecute criminals. You target the bad guys. You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general. Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns. He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials. And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, ""give me your guns, I'm rounding them up,"" she would.And let me make a final point on this. Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment. Unless you are clinically insane...(LAUGHTER)... that's what you say in a primary. But the voters are savvier than that. They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words. I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race. There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.BARTIROMO: Senator...(APPLAUSE)... let me follow up and switch gears.Senator Cruz, you suggested Mr. Trump, quote, ""embodies New York values."" Could you explain what you mean by that?CRUZ: You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: I am from New York. I don't.CRUZ: What -- what -- you're from New York? So you might not.(LAUGHTER)But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.(APPLAUSE)And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York. But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's ""Born in the USA"", and I was asked what I thought of that.And I said, ""well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"" And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert. And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.And his explanation -- he said, ""look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York. Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."" And so that was his explanation.And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way. Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan. I'm just saying.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Are you sure about that?CAVUTO: Maria...TRUMP: So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.(APPLAUSE)And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people. I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place. It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York. You had two one hundred...(APPLAUSE)... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down. I saw them come down. Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction. I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it. And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.TRUMP: And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers. And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor bush, for the third time in as many months, the Iranians have provoked us, detaining us, as we've been discussing, with these 10 Navy sailors Tehran had said strayed into their waters. The sailors were released, but only after shown on video apologizing for the incident. This occurring only weeks after Iran fired multiple rockets within 1,500 yards of a U.S. aircraft carrier and then continued to test medium range missiles.Now you've claimed that such actions indicate Tehran has little to fear from a President Obama. I wonder, sir, what would change if they continued doing this sort of thing under a President Jeb Bush?BUSH: Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military. Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again. It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.The deployments are too high for the military personnel. We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment. The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman. The planes are older than the pilots. We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board. We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --(APPLAUSE)... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations. The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak. This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran. We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Thank you, Governor. Governor Kasich, while everyone has been focusing on Iran's provocations, I'm wondering what you make of what Saudi Arabia has been doing and its recent moves in the region, including its execution of a well-known Shi'ite cleric and its move to dramatically increase oil production, some say in an effort to drive down oil prices and force a lot of U.S. oil producers out of business.Sure enough, oil prices have tumbled. One brokerage house is predicting a third or more of American oil producers and those heavily invested in fracking will go bankrupt, and soon Saudi Arabia and OPEC will be back in the driver's seat.U.S. energy player Harold Hamrie similarly told me with friends like these, who needs enemies? Do you agree?KASICH: Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina. Let em also tell you...(APPLAUSE)... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense. And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems. So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country. And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses. That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way. And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.(APPLAUSE)KASICH: So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool. You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go. And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War. You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us. And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.Thank you.CAVUTO: Thank you John.BARTIROMO: There's much more ahead including the fight against ISIS. More from Charleston, South Carolina when we come right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: We welcome back to the Republican Presidential Debate, right back to the questions.Candidates, the man who made fighting ISIS the cornerstone of his campaign, South Carolina Senator, Lindsey Graham is out the race but he joins us tonight in the audience.(APPLAUSE)He says, ""the air-strike now in their 16th month have been ineffective."" Dr. Carson ...CARSON: Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?BARTIROMO: The air-strikes.CARSON: OK.BARTIROMO: Now in their 16th month are ineffective. Dr. Carson, do you think Senator Graham is right in wanting to send 20,000 troops -- ground troops to Iraq and Syria to take out ISIS?CARSON: Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing. Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, ""what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?""Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need. I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.In addition to that...(APPLAUSE)... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue. You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- ""we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it"" -- give me a break.Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them. So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed. You know, that's so simple.(APPLAUSE)And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers. Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go. They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. Senator Graham has also said that the U.S. will find Arab support for its coalition if it removes Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. And I quote, ""The now king of Saudi Arabia told us, 'you can have our army, you just got to deal with Assad.'""The emir of Qatar said, 'I'll pay for the operation, but they are not going to fight ISIS and let Damascus fall into the hands of the Iranians. Assad has to go.'""Governor Christie, how important is it to remove Assad from power and how would you do it?CHRISTIE: Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot. You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing. In fact, he's done worse than nothing.This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer. Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad. The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria. We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.The Syrians should stay in Syria. They shouldn't be going to Europe. And here's the last piece...(APPLAUSE)... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge. You're simply not. And so Senator Graham is right about this.And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.And believe me, Assad is not worth it. And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.Hillary Clinton cannot be president. It will lead to even greater war in this world. And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.That makes the world less peaceful, less safe. In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.(APPLAUSE)Mr. Trump -- Mr. Trump, your comments about banning Muslims from entering the country created a firestorm. According to Facebook, it was the most-talked-about moment online of your entire campaign, with more than 10 million people talking about the issue.Is there anything you've heard that makes you want to rethink this position?TRUMP: No.No.(APPLAUSE)Look, we have to stop with political correctness. We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.TRUMP: I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.We have to find out what's going on. I said temporarily. I didn't say permanently. I said temporarily. And I have many great Muslim friends. And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, ""Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it.""And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason. And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem. My Muslim friends, some, said, ""thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it.""But we have a serious problem. And we can't be the stupid country any more. We're laughed at all over the world.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS. The Kurds are our strongest allies. They're Muslim. You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?The other Arab countries have a role to play in this. We cannot be the world's policeman. We can't do this unilaterally. We have to do this in unison with the Arab world. And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.(APPLAUSE)So I hope you'll reconsider. I hope you'll reconsider. The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously? What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?CAVUTO: But you said -- you said that he made those comments and they represented him being unhinged after he made them.BUSH: Yeah, they are unhinged.CAVUTO: Well -- well, after he made them...(APPLAUSE)... his poll numbers went up eight points in South Carolina. Now -- now, wait...TRUMP: Eleven points, to be exact.CAVUTO: Are you -- are you saying -- are you saying that all those people who agree with Mr. Trump are unhinged?BUSH: No, not at all, absolutely not. I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically. I totally get that. But we're running for the presidency of the United States here. This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job. You have to lead. You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength. And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I want security for this country. OK?(APPLAUSE)I want security. I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot. I want security for this country. We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam. We have a tremendous problem. It's not only a problem here. It's a problem all over the world.I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them. I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment. Why weren't they vigilant? Why didn't they call? Why didn't they call the police?And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country. I will tell you that.(APPLAUSE)The most mistreated people. In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance. We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on. Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?There's something going on and it's bad. And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it. That's all I'm saying. We need security.BARTIROMO: We -- we want to hear from all of you on this. According to Pew Research, the U.S. admits more than 100,000 Muslim immigrants every single year on a permanent lifetime basis. I want to ask the rest of you to comment on this. Do you agree that we should pause Muslim immigration until we get a better handle on our homeland security situation, as Mr. Trump has said?Beginning with you, Governor Kasich.KASICH: I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees. And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them. But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.KASICH: And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago. If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states. We need Jordan.We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.(BELL RINGS)It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again. And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it. And that's just not acceptable.But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir, we want to hear from the rest of you,Governor Christie, your take.CHRISTIE: Now Maria, listen. I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind. And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe. That's the end of the conversation.I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue. Here's the way you need to deal with it. You can't just ban all Muslims. You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists. You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.(BELL RINGS)And this summer, we didn't do that. We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president. Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.BARTIROMO: Senator Rubio, where do you stand?RUBIO: Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue. Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck. They are much more than that. This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region. This is not some small scale group.They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world. So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president. If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, where do you stand? Senator Cruz?CRUZ: You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism. What should we do? First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...(BELL RINGS)... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory. Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida. When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS(APPLAUSE).BARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, where do you stand? Do you agree with Mr. Trump?CARSON: Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem. But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics. And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that. And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place. They have infrastructure. All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November. Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.BARTIROMO: So, to be clear, the both of you do not agree with Mr. Trump?BUSH: So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with? Of course not. What we need to do is destroy ISIS.I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a ""No Fly Zone"" and ""Safe Zones"" to make sure refugees are there. We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria. We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military. We need to arm the Kurds the directly. We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters. That's how you solve the problem. You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.BARTIROMO: Thank you governor.CAVUTO: Mr. Trump, sometimes maybe in the heat of the campaign, you say things and you have to dial them back. Last week, the New York Times editorial board quoted as saying that you would oppose, ""up to 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods.""TRUMP: That's wrong. They were wrong. It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.CAVUTO: Well...TRUMP: They were wrong.CAVUTO: You never said because they provided that...TRUMP: No, I said, "" I would use -- "" they were asking me what to do about North Korea. China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea. They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.They say, "" well, we don't really have control."" Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat. China is ripping us on trade. They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies. Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: So they've never said to put a tariff on their... TRUMP: We've lost anywhere between four and seven million jobs because of China. What I said then was, ""we have very unfair trade with China. We're going to have a trade deficit of 505 billion dollars this year with China."" A lot of that is because they devalue their currency.What I said to the New York Times, is that, ""we have great power, economic power over China and if we wanted to use that and the amount -- where the 45 percent comes in, that would be the amount they saw their devaluations that we should get."" That we should get.What I'm saying is this, I'm saying that we do it but if they don't start treating us fairly and stop devaluing and let their currency rise so that our companies can compete and we don't lose all of these millions of jobs that we're losing, I would certainly start taxing goods that come in from China. Who the hell has to lose 505 billion dollars a year?CAVUTO: I'm sorry, you lost me.TRUMP: It's not that complicated actually.CAVUTO: Then I apologize. Then I want to understand, if you don't want a 45 percent tariff, say that wasn't the figure, would you be open -- are you open to slapping a higher tariff on Chinese goods of any sort to go back at them?TRUMP: OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China. Carl Icon today as you know endorsed. Many businessmen want to endorse me.CAVUTO: I know...TRUMP: Carl said, ""no, no -- "" but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this. If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do. They do whatever what they do, OK. When we do business with China, they tax us. You don't know it, they tax us.I have many friends that deal with China. They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed. If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field. I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.I'm a free trader. I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate. I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine. I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).I love China. I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.CAVUTO: So you're open to a tariff?TRUMP: I'm totally open to a tariff. If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed. You can't deal in China without tariffs. They do it to us, we don't it. It's not fair trade.KASICH: Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this. I'm a free trader. I support NAFTA. I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China. And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials. But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit. And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...TRUMP: I'm happy to have him tonight...(LAUGHTER)KASICH: For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us. And guess what? The worker's out of a job.So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker? Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade. And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.And I want to just suggest to you. How do I know this? Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar. And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load. So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country. That's what I think we need to do.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: All right.RUBIO: But on this point, if I may add something on this point. We are all frustrated with what China is doing. I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff. If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.It begins with tax reform. Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world. Let's allow companies to immediately expense.(APPLAUSE)It continues with regulatory reform. Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.How about Obamacare, a certified job killer? It needs to be repealed and replaced. And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger. That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.TRUMP: Neil, the problem...BARTIROMO: We're getting...TRUMP: ... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long. It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money. We just can't do it any longer.CAVUTO: He is right. If you put a tariff on a good, it's Americans who pay.BUSH: Absolutely.TRUMP: You looking at me?BUSH: Yeah.BARTIROMO: Prices go higher for...TRUMP: Can I tell you what? It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up. They're never going to let it happen.Japan, the same thing. They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph). Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan. Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor. And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.BARTIROMO: Yeah.BUSH: So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China. Or how about Boeing right here within a mile? Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus? Of course, they would. This would be devastating for the economy. We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.BARTIROMO: Real quick, Senator -- go ahead, Senator Cruz.(APPLAUSE)And then we have to get to tax reform.TRUMP: And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK? Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.AUDIENCE: Boo.TRUMP: We don't need that. That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that. And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now. And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look. They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China. They don't want them made here. They want those planes made in China.BUSH: They're a mile away from here.TRUMP: That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Governor Bush. Thank you, Mr. Trump. Very briefly.BUSH: My name was mentioned. My name was mentioned here. The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China. You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you? Right there, right next to the plant.TRUMP: No, the new planes. I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Mr. Trump.BUSH: When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...BARTIROMO: Thank you, Mr. Trmup. Thank you, Governor.TRUMP: I'll check for you.BUSH: Check it out.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Senator briefly.CRUZ: Thanks for coming back to me, Maria. Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground. Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.CRUZ: You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere. They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers. They're protectionist.But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...(APPLAUSE)... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax. It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...(BELL RINGS)... tariffs that come against us. It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...(UNKNOWN): Maria...CRUZ: ... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: We've got to get to tax reform, gentlemen. We've got to get to tax reform, and we've got to get to the...(UNKNOWN): Yeah, but I want to talk about taxes.BARTIROMO: ... we've got to get to the national debt as well. Coming up next, the growing national debt, the war on crime, tax reform. More from North Charleston, South Carolina, when we come right back.COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate here in North Charleston. Right back to the questions.(APPLAUSE)Governor Christie, we have spoken much about cutting spending, given the $19 trillion debt. But according to one report, America needs $3.6 trillion in infrastructure spending by 2020.Here in South Carolina, 11 percent of bridges are considered structurally deficient, costing drivers a billion dollars a year in auto repairs. What is your plan to fix the ailing roads and bridges without breaking the bank?CHRISTIE: Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria. Here's -- here's our plan. We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax. And who can blame them? They pay tax once overseas. They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States. We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money. And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.It would not necessitate us raising any taxes. It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about. And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this. You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America. He's penalized -- and doesn't understand. In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration. That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country. We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history. We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. Dr. Carson...(APPLAUSE)... it is true U.S. companies have $2 trillion in cash sitting overseas right now. That could be used for investment and jobs in America.Also, several companies right now are pursuing mergers to move their corporate headquarters abroad, and take advantage of much lower taxes. What will you do to stop the flow of companies building cash away from America, and those leaving America altogether?CARSON: Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed. A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money. You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this. You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car. In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation. But...(LAUGHTER)... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services. And it's the most regressive tax there is.You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that. A rich person does not. Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this. And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.It's not the evil rich people. It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.Senator Rubio...TRUMP: Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion. It's one of the biggest problems our country has. Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.TRUMP: They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in. But they can't get along. They can't even make a deal.Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal. We have to do something. Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have. So many companies are going to leave our country.BARTIROMO: Which is why we raised it.Senator Rubio?Thank you, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Thank you.BARTIROMO: One of the biggest fiscal challenges is our entitlement programs, particularly Social Security and Medicare. What policies will you put forward to make sure these programs are more financially secure?RUBIO: Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: Here is the one thing I'm not going to do. I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan. It's called the value added tax. And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said. Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.Now, you can support one now that's very low. But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors. Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job. And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, yes. You were meant to. Yes, of course.CRUZ: Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat. A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.This is a business flat tax. It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax. It goes away. It enables us to eliminate the death tax.If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone. We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes. And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent. Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent. My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS. Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity. We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...(BELL RINGS)... the mandates and have a simple flat tax. The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan. I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.BARTIROMO: Thank you senator.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: But that's not an accurate description of the plan. Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax. Someone's going to be collecting this tax.In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found? That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax. Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.So there are people watching tonight in business. If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from? You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold. You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government. Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at. But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...(BELL RINGS)and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent. Now, you've got Europe.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Thank you senator. I have to get to a question for Mr. Trump.CRUZ: Maria...CRUZ: Maria, I'd just like to say...(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements. Do you remember that, everybody? This was a question on entitlements.And the reason -- and the reason...(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: ... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it. Here's the thing.(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: The fact is, the reason why...RUBIO: If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.CHRISTIE: ... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard. It's a hard problem. And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes. Bernie Sanders has already said it. And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund. A Republican Congress did that.And the fact is it was wrong. And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security. We need to reform Social Security. Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE) CARSON: Can I just add one very quick thing? And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan. And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best. Just want to get that out there, just saying.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Dr. Carson.Coming up, how would the candidates protect America, and another terror attack, if we were to see it. But first, you can join us live on stage during the commercial break right from home. Go to facebook.com/foxbusiness. We'll be streaming live and answering your questions during this break next.More from South Carolina coming up. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Mr. Trump, your net worth is in the multi-billions of dollars and have an ongoing thriving hotel and real estate business. Are you planning on putting your assets in a blind trust should you become president? With such vast wealth, how difficult will it be for you to disentangle yourself from your business and your money and prioritize America's interest first?TRUMP: Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company. As you too know, I know I built a very great company. But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company. It's peanuts.I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again. I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there. Run the company kids, have a good time. I'm going to do it for America.So I would -- I would be willing to do that.BARTIROMO: So you'll put your assets in a blind trust?TRUMP: I would put it in a blind trust. Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it. If that's a blind trust, I don't know. But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.BARTIROMO: Thank you sir.TRUMP: Thank you.CAVUTO: Governor Christie, going back to your U.S. Attorney days, you had been praised by both parties as certainly a tough law and order guy. So I wonder what you make of recent statistics that showed violent crimes that have been spiking sometimes by double digit ratings in 30 cities across the country. Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn said, ""most local law enforcement officials feel abandoned by Washington."" Former NYC Police Chief Ray Kelly, says that, ""police are being less proactive because they're being overly scrutinized and second guessed and they're afraid of being sued or thrown in jail.""What would you do as president to address this?CHRISTIE: Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan. He said, ""there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."" Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president. Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time. This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country. That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws. And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal. This president allows lawlessness throughout this country. Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General. I'd say, ""General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively. Make our streets safe again. Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them.""We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well. I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.CAVUTO: Thank you governor.Governor Kasich, as someone has to deal with controversial police shootings in your own state, what do you make of Chicago's move recently to sort of retrain police? Maybe make them not so quick to use their guns?KASICH: Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat. She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.KASICH: And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.KASICH: And they came back with 23 recommendations. One of them is a statewide use of deadly force. And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio. Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police. Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life. Their family is waiting for them.At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions. But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong. And it has been a remarkable situation in our state. And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks. It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have. Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed. I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone. You've got to bring people together. You've got to give people hope.And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America. And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Senator Rubio?(APPLAUSE)Under current law, the U.S. is on track to issue more new permanent immigrants on green cards over the next five years than the entire population of South Carolina. The CBO says your 2013 immigration bill would have increased green cardholders by another 10 million over 10 years.Why are you so interested in opening up borders to foreigners when American workers have a hard enough time finding work?RUBIO: Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years. And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job. This issue is not about that anymore.First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe. And here's why. There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system. And not just green cards. They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances. They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States. So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States. So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.BARTIROMO: So your thinking has changed?RUBIO: The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago. Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally. They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS. Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees. We know this for a fact. They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border. And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida. We had Boko Haram. We had Hamas. We had Hezbollah. We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America. It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, Senator.CRUZ: It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees. It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.I think that's a mistake. That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it. And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries. I voted yes to suspend that. Marco voted on the other side. So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.RUBIO: Maria, let me clear something up here. This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.RUBIO: Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it. You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it. You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it. You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it. I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.(APPLAUSE)That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation. When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant. Edward Snowden is a traitor. And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.(APPLAUSE)And one more point, one more point. Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it. Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this. If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: There's -- look, there's --CAVUTO: Gentlemen, gentlemen --CRUZ: I'm going to get a response to that, Neil. There's no way he launches 11 attack --CAVUTO: Very quick, very quick. CRUZ: I'm going to -- he had no fewer than 11 attacks there. I appreciate your dumping your (inaudible) research folder on the debate stage.RUBIO: No, it's your record.CRUZL But I will say --CAVUTO: Do you think they like each other?CRUZ: -- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false. They're absolutely false.AUDIENCE: Boo.CRUZ: So let's start -- let's start with immigration. Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity. Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty. I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King. Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals. I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion. What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true. And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.CAVUTO: All right, gentlemen, we've got to stop. I know you are very passionate about that.(APPLAUSE)Governor Bush, fears have gripped this country obviously, and you touched on it earlier since the San Bernardino attacks. Since our last debate, the national conversation has changed, according to Facebook data as well.Now this first graphic shows the issues that were most talked about right before those attacks and now after: the issues of Islam, homeland security and ISIS now loom very large. The FBI says Islamic radicals are using social media to communicate and that it needs better access to communication. Now the CEO of Apple, Governor, Tim Cook said unless served with a warrant private communication is private, period. Do you agree, or would you try to convince him otherwise?BUSH: I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country. We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --CAVUTO: Would you answer this question?BUSH: Oh, I'll talk about that, too. But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: Fair enough. So Tim Cook -- so Tim Cook says he's going to keep it private.BUSH: I got that. And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C. There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies. They understand that there's a national security risk. We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.We need to make sure that we keep the country safe. This is the first priority. The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely. Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful. 23 million files in the hands of the Chinese? So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well. That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.CAVUTO: But if Tim cook is telling you no, Mr. President.BUSH: You've got to keep asking. You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue. If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --CAVUTO: Do you ask or do you order?BUSH: Well, if the law would change, yeah. But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States. And what we want to do is to control this.We also want to dominate this from a commercial side. So there's a lot of balanced interests. But the president leads in this regard. That's what we need. We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.CAVUTO: Governor, thank you.BARTIROMO: When we come right back, closing statements. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)Candidates, it is time for your closing statements. You get 60 seconds each.Governor John Kasich, we begin with you.KASICH: You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power. You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English. You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.KASICH: Look, that's who I stand up for. That's who's in my mind(BELL RINGS)And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Bush?BUSH: Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer? Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.Credibility counts. There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do. I've done it. I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Governor Chris Christie?CHRISTIE: Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore. They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.I love this country. It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known. We need someone to fight for the people. We need a fighter for this country again.I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Dr. Ben Carson?CARSON: You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics. The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people. And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity. Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Senator Marco Rubio?RUBIO: You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government. Our rights come from God.That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world. That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel. This country is changing. It feels different. We feel like we're being left behind and left out.And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America. We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military. And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history. If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Senator Ted Cruz?CRUZ: ""13 Hours"" -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them. I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter. This will end. It will end on January 2017.CRUZ: And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Mr. Donald Trump?TRUMP: I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers. They're tough, they're strong, they're great people. Half of them had tears pouring down their face. They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads. It was a terrible sight. A terrible sight. And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion. If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.We will make America great again. We will win on everything we do. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Candidates, thank you.CAVUTO: Gentlemen, thank you all. All of you. That wraps up our debate. We went a little bit over here. But we wanted to make sure everyone was able to say their due. He's upset. All right. Thank you for joining us. Much more to come in the Spin Room ahead.1 of 17"

Debbie Wasserman Schultz ,D-FL, Democratic National Committee Chairwoman, greets people at the Time Warner Cable Arena. (Getty Images)“It’s the message every one of you have heard,” said Ira Foreman, the man in charge of Jewish affairs for the Democratic National Committee. “that the president is awful on Israel.” After which he quickly added that the message was totally untrue. The Democrats have prepared one- and six-page versions of talking points, the latter of which is actually seven pages and provides “facts” in response to no less than 10 “myths.” The approximately 120 mostly Jewish Democrats didn’t quite fill the room and the crowd was much smaller than that at the Republican Jewish Coalition last week in Tampa (but that was on an official convention day and this wasn’t).Delaware Governor Jack Markell spoke briefly, citing just “public schools” and Israel as reasons to support Barack Obama. Evidence: Defense Minister Ehud Barak and President Shimon Peres have said relations between the U.S. and Israel have never been stronger. A word I believe I did not hear during the time I was in the meeting: Netanyahu.National Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz spoke ans was warmly received as she extolled Obamacare (Democrats are using the term) and said she has heard Israel’s Ambassador Michael Oren say, in her words, “what the Republicans is dangerous for Israel.”The Obama campaign opinion research director spoke and presented a (by partisan standards) reasonably fair PowerPoint on the polls. He got vigorous applause when he praised Obama for bringing the troops home from Iraq and for having “restored science to its rightful place.” Which auggests to me that there’s still strong opposition to George W. Bush who launched the war in Iraq and blocked government funding of embryonic stem cell research (not all health research). In contrast, he has to milk applause from the audience on gay rights issues.I don’t remember a similar meeting at a Democratic National Convention before; perhaps I missed one or more. Either way, this struck me as a very defensive exercise. Audience members were asked to talk to their friends, but skip the “10 to 12%” who are strong Republicans and are “intelligent, accomplished, smart, very practiced debaters.” Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition is sending members from safe states to Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Obama got 78% of the Jewish vote last time and has been getting about 64% in polls of Jewish voters this year. I’m betting that he ends up closer to that number than to his 2008 number. That would reduce the Democratic margin (or increase the Republican margin), according to Foreman, by 83,500 in Pennsylvania, 41,500 in Pennsylvania, 19,000 in Ohio, 12,500 in Virginia, 11,500 in Colorado, 11,000 in Michigan and 9,500 in Nevada.Share your thoughts with friends.

Tomorrow, the Senate is scheduledto hold its first vote on the biggest overhaul in decades of thenation's financial system, changes that could impact your savings, yourpension, maybe even your job. This as a big Wall Street investment bankcomes under attack on Tuesday. Executives from Goldman Sachs, which isalready facing government accusations of fraud, will testify before aSenate committee investigating whether the firm profited from themassive housing crash at the expense of its clients. Joining me this morning, three key players in the middle of thisstorm. With me here, is Austan Goolsbee from the President Obama'sPlaynullCouncil of Economic Advisers. In Chattanooga, we have TennesseeRepublican Senator Bob Corker, and in Cincinnati, Democratic SenatorSherrod Brown, both key members of the Senate Banking Committee. Gentlemen, welcome. GOOLSBEE: Thanks for having us. CORKER: Good morning. Good to be with you. TAPPER: Before we start with Wall Street reform, I do want to talkabout these Goldman Sachs memos, these emails that the Senate PermanentSubcommittee on Investigations has released, emails that seem to showexecutives rejoicing as the housing market crashed, and in fact, theyseem to contradict the impression given by Goldman Sachs that they lostPlaynullmoney as the mortgage related investment crash happened. In a privateemail, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein wrote in November of 2007, ""Of coursewe didn't dodge the mortgage mess. We lost money, then made more thanwe lost because of shorts."" Senator Brown, I want to ask you. What do these emails signify to you? BROWN: Well, these emails signify that there are all kinds ofconflicts of interest on Wall Street, that there are -- that WallStreet, while working for its clients and working against its clients inthe same sort of bundled toxic securities, and that's why we need theVolcker rule. That's why we need really strong reform that willseparate the proprietary trading from banking functions. I think thatsays it more articulately and more forcefully, that example, thananything we've seen so far. TAPPER: Senator Corker, doesn't Senator Brown have a point? Thisis exactly why people think that proprietary trading, that is when abank uses its own money to invest, should not be the same, it should notbe in the same firm as trading for commercial banking, for clients? That there is an inbred conflict of interest there. CORKER: Well, I can understand the sentiment. I know thatcertainly the emails do not read well. I look forward to seeing whatthe SEC investigation brings forth, and the Senate investigation throughthis subcommittee brings forth. At the end of the day, though, some ofthat has to do with making markets. I am in no way defending sort ofthe attitude expressed in the emails, but I think we're better offwaiting to see exactly what has taken place. I think, you know, at the end of the day, instruments are set up onWall Street. People take either side of it. There are some conflictsof interest that can exist and do need to be looked at, but I'd ratherwait and see how this investigation unfolds before making any judgments. TAPPER: Austan, is there anything in the legislation that Democratsare pushing that President Obama wants to pass, is there anything thatwould have prevented what Goldman Sachs is accused of having committed? GOOLSBEE: You know, I don't know the exact details, but there are anumber of things that would go directly at the heart of some of theseissues that are raised in these cases, like with securitizations, thatthe people who originate the securities have to maintain some ownershipso that if they pack it full of things that are going to fail, theythemselves are going to lose money when they do it. I'm certainly notgoing to comment on independent, you know, regulatory investigations,but these emails that are released, the CEO of Goldman is not going towin any popularity contests when over a period that ordinary Americans'pensions, houses et cetera were collapsing in value, they were actuallymaking significant money off of it. If that's true, I think SenatorBrown's point, that we've got to end the conflicts of interest and thatthe Volcker rule is really on point on that I think is also highly relevant. TAPPER: Senator Corker, the status of the Wall Street reform bill. Right now, the members of the Senate Banking Committee are negotiating. Tomorrow, the majority leader, Harry Reid, is scheduled to bring it upfor a vote. Do you think there will be a bipartisan compromise beforethat vote happens, and if not, are all 41 Republicans going to standagainst proceeding to a debate? CORKER: Look, first of all, I think everybody knows, Sherrod sureknows I want to see a bill. I think we do need to address regulation inour financial markets. You know, it's in play right now. The fact is,I know that Shelby and Dodd are actually on another program thismorning. After that program, I know they're going to continue meeting,hopefully getting to a compromise before tomorrow evening. And I think what we need to do is have a template. We don't need toaddress every issue in this compromise, but one that deals withderivatives, one that deals with consumer protection, and one that dealswith this orderly liquidation. If we can get that template agreed to ina bipartisan way, then we can debate some of the amendments that SherrodBrown wants to bring forth, some of the amendments I want to bringforth. But I think it's very, very important that we reach thatbipartisan agreement first, because in the Senate, as you know, it takes60 votes to change anything. This is something, by the way, that everyone has committed to try todo, and that is to have this bipartisan agreement before it goes to thefloor. I think it's important that we do so. TAPPER: So if there is no bipartisan agreement, Republicans willblock the motion to proceed to debating this bill? CORKER: I think that's very likely. And I do want to say that wevoted this bill, 1336 pages, we voted it out of committee in 21 minuteswith no amendments, with the understanding that before the bill came tothe floor, we would reach this bipartisan agreement. So again, we just want to see what was stated honored. And I knowSherrod Brown and Austan both know I want to see a bill. But I think,again, having this template done first is very, very important. It'svery likely, I think it's almost a given, that if we don't reach thatbipartisan agreement, that Republicans will probably want to put inplace something that allows those negotiations to keep going for a whileuntil we do that. So yes, 41 Republicans in my opinion would block itunless we reached this agreement, which we've all stated needs to occur. TAPPER: Senator Brown, let me ask you a question about thelegislation itself. I have a copy of it here, and it says right at thetop of the bill that the purpose is to promote the financial stabilityof the United States by improving accountability and transparency in thefinancial system, to end too-big-to-fail, and for other purposes. Senator Brown, does this bill end too-big-to-fail? BROWN: Yes, it does. It can do it better, and Senator Corker waspart of the negotiations that deal with the resolution authority. But Ialso--(CROSSTALK)TAPPER: Just to interject, the resolution authority is for thefederal government to come in, and if there is a failing financialsystem, to take over and liquidate that firm. I'm sorry, Senator Brown,go on. BROWN: But let me go back to something Bob just said, then I'llanswer the question more specifically. You know, some Wall Streetpeople have said the longer they can delay this, the more chance theycan kill it. And I just don't want to see it delayed. We've been --two years ago was the Bear Stearns problem. Ever since then, SenatorDodd in November put out a working draft. He then put teams together,including Senator Corker and Senator Warner and Gregg and others andSenator Dodd and Shelby, and it's -- and Senator Reed, and Jack Reed waspart of that too -- so we've been working on this for a long time. I hope that tomorrow night when we have a vote -- all we're askingtomorrow night is 60 votes. We need a Republican or two or three tosimply say, let's move forward and debate, and then Bob Corker and I andothers can offer any kinds of amendments we want. So I hope that theywill not en masse -- and put it this way, I wish there were more BobCorkers in the Senate Republican caucus, because he's been very openwith negotiations. And then Senator Shelby and Senator -- MinorityLeader McConnell pulled them back, I think on behalf of Wall Streetlobbyists. But put that aside, in terms of too-big-to-fail, we do have thisresolution authority. It's well done, written by Senator Corker andSenator Dodd and some others bipartisanly. I think we need to do moreto prevent too big, though. Too-big-to-fail is too big, and myamendment that Senator Kaufman from Delaware and I are offering nextweek or the week after will basically say that we'll put some limits onthe size of these banks. Let me give you one statistic, if I could, Jake. Fifteen years ago,the six -- the assets of the six largest banks in this country totaled17 percent of GDP, 17 percent of GDP. The assets of the six largestbanks in the United States today total 63 percent of GDP, and that's too-- we've got to deal with risk to be sure, but we've got to deal withthe size of these banks, because if one of these banks is in serioustrouble, it will have such a ripple effect on the whole economy. So wesimply can't let them get this big and have this kind of economic powerover Main Street, over a small business in Canton, Ohio, or a worker --a manufacturing plant in Dayton. I mean, we just can't let this happen. TAPPER: And Austan, Senator Brown is going to introduce anamendment that would cap the amount a bank can borrow to financeoperations at 2 percent of GDP, 2 percent of the gross domesticproduct. Wouldn't that actually stop too-big-to-fail by preventingthese banks from being too big? And why isn't the administration behindthat? GOOLSBEE: Well, the president is totally committed and it's one ofhis key principles that we're going to end too-big-to-fail, we're goingto end the bailout era that began under the last president, for good. That's not going to happen anymore. We can open -- we're open tonegotiating details obviously as we start getting into it. They'recomplicated. Some of these financial risks are more like worms whereyou could chop them in half, but it doesn't kill them, it just gives youtwo different worms. Bear Stearns, AIG, they weren't the biggest, theywere just the most dangerous, and we've got to come at this from every side. Look, we're open to looking at ending too-big-to-fail on the sizeangle, on the what risky investments they're allowed to take, looking atthe derivatives component so that AIG-like, they can't threaten to blowup the whole world because of -- because they have some of this $600trillion pool of derivatives that we know virtually nothing about, thatare in the dark. All of that ends when we sign this bill. If you lookat the bill and take a step back -- I don't know much about thelegislative strategies that are going on in the Senate. They areimportant. I do know that the president has laid out what this billdoes, is we're going to end bailouts, we're going to hold accountablethe people that get into the messes. So if they get in trouble, theyfail. All we're going to do is pay funeral expenses, and we're going tohave the strongest consumer protections ever in this country. TAPPER: Let me stop you right there, because you said that we'regoing to hold accountable the people that get us into these messes. ButSenator Corker, I think one of the problems that a lot of the Americanpeople have with bailouts and with this legislation is that they feelthat after these firms fail, or are propped up by the U.S. taxpayer,they take billions of taxpayer dollars, then the CEOs and the boardmembers drive off in their Austin Martins to their $20 million houses inthe Hamptons with their $500 million in the bank, and there's noaccountability whatsoever. Is there anything in this bill that providesany personal accountability for these CEOs? CORKER: Before I answer that, let me refer to something SenatorBrown said. I -- nobody pulled me back from negotiations. The fact isthat Senator Dodd, and he said this publicly, left me at the altar. Andthe reason was, as we negotiated, Democrats were being lost, and I thinkhe wanted to get the bill out of committee on a party-line vote. Imean, he has stated that publicly. So nobody has pulled me back. I'mmy own person and I want to get a good bill here. But back to the question you're asking. There is no question, and Ithink that first of all, I plan to offer changes to this resolutionauthority that say that, if a large entity like this has to go throughthis resolution where in essence they're liquidated in an orderly way, Ithink that everything that the executive team and the board members haveearned through this company over the last five years needs to be clawedback. In other words, there needs to be some penalties assessed to themanagement that have caused the country to have to go through thisorderly liquidation process. So absolutely, I will be offering anamendment that deals with that, so that we're taking back, we're clawingback all the earnings that management has made out of this firm, if ithas to go through orderly liquidation. I think that's very appropriate,and certainly I'm going to be doing that on the floor if it doesn't makeit into the base bill. TAPPER: Austan, can the White House get behind that clawbackprovision? Are you being out-populisted by Republicans? GOOLSBEE: Well, look, in the bill now -- the president went toCooper Union this last week to revisit the spot where more than twoyears ago, he went and said we need to have fundamental reform--TAPPER: But there is no clawback in this bill? GOOLSBEE: There is a requirement that they're all fired. If youget to that point, all the management is fired--TAPPER: So they take their $500 million to their home in the Hamptons. GOOLSBEE: -- all the shareholders are wiped out. Well, look, as Isay, on any details, we're open to looking at negotiating the details ofhow we carry out the president's principles. But if negotiation -- andSenator Corker, to his credit, is not in this camp -- but if thenegotiators are going to come forward more as a delaying tactic andwe're just going to put in hundreds of amendments and try to keep thisgoing so as to stall, delay and kill reform, that's not going tohappen. This is going to pass. CORKER: Well, let me--TAPPER: One of the big -- let me just move on to another subject ifI could, but we will get back to you, Senator Corker. One of the bigdebates going on within the Democratic caucus is how strong thederivative legislation should be. Derivatives are these risky bets thatbig money men and women make on whether or not an industry will rise orfall in value, and it's a way to hedge a lot of risk. Senator Brown, you are in favor of Senator Lincoln's provision,Blanche Lincoln from Arkansas. She wants to say, if you're a bank andyou have federally insured money, you have to separate these derivativestraders. It's too risky what they do. We should not have anyconnection with taxpayer insured money. Do you think that the Democratsare going to put that in the bill? And if not, why not? BROWN: Well, I hope so and I think so. I -- this goes back toreally your first question on the conflicts of interest on Wall Street,that you really can't serve two masters. You can't serve your clientsand serve yourself and play these transactions one off against another. And I think that these -- anything we do in this bill, whether it'sconsumer protection standalone -- I hope that the Consumer ProtectionAgency, whether it's regulation of derivatives, whether it'stoo-big-to-fail, whether it's the Volcker rule separating outproprietary trading and, as I say, from standard banking practices. Anyof those conflicts of interests, we have to address in this bill, and Ithink that -- I think that Senator Lincoln and her draft in theAgriculture Committee that we voted out last week, we got one Republicansupporting it, Senator Grassley did. And I think that was a good sign. I think it means that there will be a number of Republicans that are asopen-minded as Senator Corker, that will want to move forward Mondaynight. And again, just to let us begin the debate. I mean, the Monday voteis going to be -- are we going to start the debate or are we going toshut it down and continue negotiating, negotiating, negotiating. I, tome, the legislative process is, you put a bill on the floor and then BobCorker offers his amendment that I like that he just mentioned, in termsof in the resolution authority, what to do with these executives thatbrought us there. I offer my amendment on too-big-to-fail means toobig. Dozens of other amendments will be offered, we'll see whathappens, and then we vote on a bill. TAPPER: Austan, can you get behind Senator Lincoln's provision toseparate derivatives trading from banks that have federally insureddeposits? GOOLSBEE: If you take a step back, this issue of derivatives istotally central. Now, three years ago, virtually no one in America hadeven heard of derivatives, or if they had, they had nightmares of their,you know, college math class or something. The fact is that there arenow $600 trillion of derivatives that are trading in the dark, that weknow virtually nothing about and are unregulated. And it's not just aparty that's taking place on Wall Street that has no impact on America. They're exactly the things that threatened to blow up the entirefinancial system with AIG. So the president's completely committed thatwe are going to bring the $600 trillion out into the open and under theregulatory umbrella. Now, I think we made great progress that in both the Dodd andLincoln's versions of what would happen with derivatives, we purged abunch of the loopholes that some of the banks had gotten put into thebills before. The president is not going to allow putting loopholes inthat let these $600 trillion get back into the dark and threaten thewhole system. We can work on the -- so the--TAPPER: But you guys--(CROSSTALK)TAPPER: -- don't support separating it, though, right? GOOLSBEE: Well, there are several very technical aspects ofdifference between the Lincoln bill and the Dodd bill--TAPPER: It's not really actually that technical, whether or not--GOOLSBEE: I don't agree with that. TAPPER: It's whether or not commercial banks should be able to dothis. Senator Corker, I hear you giggling--(CROSSTALK)TAPPER: You think Senator Lincoln's provision goes a little toofar, right? Senator Corker? CORKER: Are you talking to--(CROSSTALK)TAPPER: Yes, yes, of course, Senator Corker. CORKER: Yes. Yes, I mean, I think what -- I think what Austan issaying is he doesn't support it. And I don't either. Let me say this,I want to see as much traded through clearinghouses as possible. Iabsolutely agree that that needs to occur. We don't want to force thosethings that are not liquid to be traded on the clearinghouse, but I'm onthe side of let's get as much as possible. The fact is that Senator Brown is in a state where a lot ofmanufacturing takes place. I'm in a state where a lot of manufacturingtakes place. And what people don't I think appreciate so much is thatall of these tools are used for capital formation. They help companieshedge their risk. They help companies create capital, and I think if westart drawing lines in the sand where we take these tools away, what wereally do is hamper companies' ability to access capital. So I don'tthink separation is appropriate. I do think clearing as much aspossible so that on a daily basis, if somebody is money bad, they haveto put money up to be money good or neutral, so that we don't end up inthe kind of situation we have with AIG. But I think it hampers ourability, again, to create great companies if we just create an absoluteseparation. TAPPER: Unfortunately, that's all the time we have. It was a greatdebate, and I really thank you, Senator Corker in Chattanooga, SenatorBrown in Cincinnati and Austan Goolsbee here in the studio. Thanks somuch for joining us. Really appreciate it. As our roundtable takes their seats, take a look at how SaturdayNight Live portrayed the president's speech on Thursday, pitching reformto Wall Street executives. TAPPER: And we're joined now by our roundtable, as always. GeorgeWill, Cynthia Tucker of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Paul Krugmanof the New York Times and Alexis Glick, former vice president at FoxBusiness News. Thank you all for joining us. George, does this legislation end too-big-to-fail? WILL: No, because that's not the problem. It's -- we all sort ofsympathize with Sherrod Brown and Senator Kaufman's idea that if it'stoo big to fail, it's too big to exist. The problem is it's not scale,it's connectedness that poses so-called system risk. And what peopleare arguing about is whether or not they have accurately located risk tothe entire system. This is an unusual argument. Usually in Washington when there'scontroversy about a bill, the two sides agree about what the bill doesbut not whether it ought to be done. In this case, there's an argumentabout whether or not the bill will actually do what it sets out to do. Both sides want to guarantee the obliteration of certain kinds offailed firms. They want the management to go and they want shareholderequity to disappear. So it's a competition to see who can be mostbeastly to these bad companies. And the question is whether or not thishappens. TAPPER: Cynthia, it's unclear right now if there's going to be abipartisan compromise, but you heard Senator Corker say that thenegotiations should continue. You don't really have a lot of faith inthat. TUCKER: No, and the Democrats don't either, for good reason. Wesaw this tactic used with health care reform, when Max Baucus was givenmonths to negotiate with Republicans. At the end of the day therewasn't a single Senate Republican voting for health care reform. So,you know, Mitch McConnell came out just a few weeks ago and said, let'sstart over with this financial reform bill. That was the very sametactic used with health care reform. So Democrats need to be leery ofthis idea of negotiate, negotiate, negotiate. It gives the lobbyiststime to lobby more, give more campaign contributions, and it gives theRepublicans time to foment opposition by mischaracterizing the bill. SoI think Chris Dodd is very leery. (CROSSTALK)TAPPER: Can I interject for one second on the campaigncontributions, and I'll come to you in a second, Paul. But the Centerfor Responsive Politics did a study of campaign contributions, and inthis cycle, the finance, insurance and real estate sectors are givingmuch more to Democrats than to Republicans. $65 million to $51million. Paul, do you think the Democratic Party is too close to WallStreet? KRUGMAN: Well, it has been in the past for sure. No question thatin the late '90s, the Clinton team -- some of whom are now in theadministration -- were way too close to Wall Street. They believed thatthese were wise men who knew what they were doing. And no, at thispoint, it's the party in power, of course, is going to be getting a lotmore contributions. It's kind of -- that's not too surprising. Let me say a couple of things here. Anyone who says we need to bebipartisan should bear in mind that for the last several weeks, MitchMcConnell, the Senate minority leader, has been trying to stop reformwith possibly the most dishonest argument ever made in the history ofpolitics, which is the claim that having regulation of the banks isactually bailing out the banks. And basically, the argument boils downto saying that what we really need to do to deal with fires is abolishthe fire department. Because then people will know that they can't lettheir buildings burn in the first place, right? It's incredible. So anyone who says bipartisan, should say, you know, bipartisandoesn't include the Senate minority leader. But, you know, I agree withGeorge, actually, believe it or not. Too big to fail per se is not theproblem. The Great Depression was made possible by the failure of theBank of the United States, which despite its name, was a Bronx-basedinstitution that was the 28th largest financial institution in theUnited States at the time, and yet brought the whole system down. But what we are getting now in this bill is a way to have gracefulfailure of big institutions, right? We know how to deal with smallbanks. The FDIC seized seven banks last week that were on the verge offailing and let them, you know, liquidated them gracefully, but we don'thave a way of dealing with complex, you know, what we call shadowbanking institutions like Lehman or Citigroup. And this bill would giveyou that. So it would give you the ability to do for big, complicatedfinancial institutions what we've been doing routinely for small ones,and that does -- so it doesn't end the too big, but it may deal with thefail bit. TAPPER: Alexis, you, unlike a lot of business journalists, actuallyhave worked in business. You've done trading at Goldman Sachs, atMorgan Stanley. What do you think of this regulation bill? Do youthink the derivatives monitoring and separation that Senator Lincoln istrying to do, do you think that goes too far? GLICK: Well, look, bottom line is, I think when you look at thederivative equation, do we need transparency? Should there be a centralclearing facility? Absolutely. It is without a doubt the wild west. It is all about that shadow banking market, that black market. We havenot been able to see who is on the other side of that transaction. I do believe that it's going too far to say that large financialinstitutions cannot have a derivative business. Believe you me, I don'twant to see one American deposit in this country used as a tool to goout on a proprietary basis for a firm's capital to go out and trade inderivatives. I don't like that. But when you come back to this too bigto fail, just to pick up on what you said, the FDIC has done aphenomenal job throughout this financial crisis. No depositor has losta dime. They've been able to wind down financial institutions in avery, very smart and effective way. The question here on resolutionauthority is what--TAPPER: The ability of the government -- I told you I'll do this --the ability of the government to step in and wind down a financialinstitution that's failing. Go. GLICK: Good job! The bill -- the question here is all those otherinstitutions who have a financial arm, as we talked about earlier. It'sthe GM situations where they have a finance arm, it's the GE Capitals ofthe world. Where do these guys fit into this equation when they may bein the manufacturing business or in other business? WILL: That's precisely what worries Republicans. They think thisis a thin end of an enormous wedge that is going to get the governmentdeeper into treating capital and credit in this country as a publicutility, to be priced and allocated here in Washington, which is, theythink, inevitably a recipe for something like crony capitalism. Becauseyou have somewhat not slippery, but open-textured definitions. Non-bankfinancial institution. Well, GMAC gets General Motors brought underTARP, and in this case, GE Capital would get all of General Electric, orwould it? We don't know. Would it be a segment of General Electricbrought under this bill? KRUGMAN: And yet there's no alternative. Meaning if we onlyprotect banks in the traditional sense, which are big marble buildingswith rows of tellers, you're missing 60 percent of the modern bankingsystem. The fact of the matter is, there are lots of things out there,money market funds, repo. (inaudible), but things that functionallyplay the same role as bank deposits, that can destabilize the economythe same way as bank deposits, and so we have to bring those under theumbrella. Now, we can quibble with details, but something like this hasto be done. TAPPER: Let me just interject for one second. We're going to takea quick break. And when we come back, our roundtable will take upArizona's crackdown on illegal immigrants and what will the impact be onimmigration reform. And later, the Sunday funnies. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAY LENO: He just played golf for the 32nd time in his presidency. He sent more troops to Iraq, wants more oil drilling, gave billions toWall Street. Rush Limbaugh said he wanted a Republican president, hegot one. (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)TAPPER: Coming up next, more of the ""Roundtable"" and of course the""Sunday Funnies."" (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BREWER: I have decided to sign Senate bill 1070 into law. Orderrelated violence and crimes due to illegal immigration are criticallyimportant issue for the people of our state. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People are angry. People feel held down. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Federal government isn't doing anything for us. The state has to do something. SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, R-ARIZ.: Our border is not secure, our citizensare not safe. OBAMA: The failure to act responsibly at the federal level willonly open the door to irresponsibility by others. That includes, forexample, the recent efforts in Arizona which threaten to undermine basicnotions of fairness that we cherish as Americans. (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Some sound from the heated debate over Arizona's newimmigration law. Fodder for us here on our ""Roundtable."" We're joinedas always by George Will, Cynthia Tucker of the ""AtlantaJournal-Constitution,"" Paul Krugman of the ""New York Times,"" and formervice president of FOX Business News, Alexis Glick. That's a mouth full but I got it every time. Let me start before wediscuss this bill and what it actually does by going into one of themost controversial provisions in this new law, Arizona Senate bill1070. ""For any lawful contact made by a law enforcement official, wherereasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien who isunlawfully present in the United States, s reasonable attempt shall bemade when practicable to determine the immigration status of the person."" ""Reasonable suspicion"" that the person is an alien. What does thatmean, George? WILL: Well, the Fourth Amendment says there should be nounreasonable searches and seizures, and we've generated volumes of caselaw trying to sort out what that means over the last century or so. Soit's not clear what that means. Let's say this about Arizona. Theyhave 460,000, an estimated 460,000 illegal immigrants there. So beforeWashington lectures Arizonans on irresponsibility, perhaps Washingtonought to attend to the central attribute of national sovereignty whichis to control the borders. We are the only developed nation in theworld with a 2,000 mile border with an undeveloped country and we have amagnet of a welfare state to the north. So this is not Arizona's fault. Beyond that, this should be saidhowever. Reasonable suspicion is going to put upon the police ofArizona a terribly difficult job. This is what the governor said. ""Wemust enforce the law evenly and without regard to skin color, accent orsocial status."" I don't know how do you that. TAPPER: Well Cynthia, how do you do that? The governor put out anexecutive order saying that there should be no racial order that thereshould be no racial profiling with this law. But if you're a police manand you've been told -- and by the way, you can be sued now under thislaw if you're not doing enough, if the citizens are convinced you're notdoing enough to crack down on illegal immigration. If you're apoliceman, what's enough? What's reasonable to think somebody might bean illegal immigrant? TUCKER: Well Jake, several law enforcement agencies have actuallyopposed the bill. Not only for that reason because they have no ideawhat it means to say reasonable suspicion. A California Republican hassaid you can tell an illegal immigrant by the shoes they wear. Ofcourse this is an invitation to racial profiling. Everyone with aSpanish surname, everyone with a certain look, you may or may not beLatino. There are people in my family who look as if they could beLatino. It harkens back to apartheid where all black people in SouthAfrica were required to carry documents in order to move from one partof town to another. And let me just say this about Arizona's problems with the border,it is absolutely true that Arizona has problems with the border. Arancher was killed apparently by drug smugglers. But this hasabsolutely no bearing on that problem. All it does is open the doorsfor harassment of citizens. TAPPER: Let's you talk about that rancher for a second. His namewas Robert Krentz and he was killed in March. Here's a friend of him,Steve Brophy, talking about his friend's death. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEVE BROPHY, KRENTZ'S FRIEND: You cannot allow a border in ourcountry that is akin in lawlessness to that of west Waziristan inPakistan. It's simply intolerable, not just for Rob Krentz and not justfor the Krentz family but for her entire country. (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Doesn't he have a point, Paul? I mean this is federalfailure at the border. KRUGMAN: Yes, we have never put in enough money is basically whatit comes down to enforce the border control. It's not a deep issue ofprinciple, it's just a question of resources. People have been willingto be very -- talk tough about it but actually not willing to doreasonable stuff in terms of enforcement. And it's going to be aproblem. But what I want to go back to here is not just apartheidissues, but think about a different way. We have these massive protests in this country about allegedauthoritarian tendencies that we are going to have some kind of --inside the Obama/Hitler stuff -- the idea that the government isencroaching too much in our lives. And now all of the sudden, we have by pretty much the same people,demanding that we set up a system that will turn us into one of thoseapocryphal foreign authoritarian regimes where the police are sayinghand over your papers, right? A world where you constantly have toprove who you are. And yes, it will be racial profiling but who knowswhat else? I mean, some people take me I look like President Lula ofBrazil, so I might end up being pulled over when I'm on my morning walk,right? TAPPER: I think you're much better looking than the president ofBrazil. (CROSSTALK)TAPPER: But you know, it's interesting that you say that, becauseyou are not the only one to evoke that, let me see your papers thing. KRUGMAN: Right. TAPPER: Cardinal Roger Mahoney on his blog wrote, quote, ""Americanpeople are fair-minded and respectful. I can't imagine Arizonans nowreverting to German Nazi and Russian Communist techniques whereby peopleare required to turn one another in to the authorities on any suspicionof documentation."" And now, Alexis, we have Senator Harry Reid and President Obamatalking about immigration reform again. We thought it was dead, wethought it wasn't going to be brought up, but it looks like this isgoing to be a big issue in Washington. GLICK: You know, I think at first glance, most people say, hey,wait a second. We're been trying to tackle too much too quickly. Butthe bottom line here is if -- this is a bill that will be the catalyst,if what has happened in Arizona is the thing that gets people moving inWashington, D.C. to address things like the border, then so be it. I saw Senator Lindsey Graham came out the other day and said, oh,wait a second, I've been working, I'm not going to show up at theconference on cap-and-trade because we said cap-and-trade is firstbefore we're going to address -- or climate change is first before we'regoing to address immigration. The bottom line, we have to addressimmigration. 11 million immigrants in this country. We have got anunemployment rate in this country at 26-, 27-year high. We have toaddress citizens and what they are going to take of the piece of thepie, what they should get in addition to what taxes they should get,what services they're going to be offered. This is an issue that has been plaguing us. We have got to addressit. WILL: Again, in defense of Arizona, large majority of Arizonanssupport this bill and a large majority of Arizonans are not, bydefinition, the fringe of the state. They are temperate, decent peoplewith a huge problem. What the Arizona law does is make a state crime out of somethingthat already is a crime, a federal crime. Now, the Arizona police --and I've spent time with the Phoenix Police Department -- these are notbad people. These are professionals who are used to making the kind ofdifficult judgments. Suspicion of intoxicated driving, all kinds ofjudgments are constantly made by policemen. And I wouldn't despairaltogether their ability to do this in a professional way. TAPPER: And we should point out, some police organizations inArizona do support it, although Cynthia, it's interesting, PresidentObama had this to say on the North Lawn of the White House, or, I'msorry, in the Rose Garden of the White House the other day, even beforethe law was passed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: I've instructed members of my administration to closelymonitor the situation and examine the civil rights and otherimplications of this legislation. But if we continue to fail to act ata federal level, we will continue to see misguided efforts opening uparound the country. (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Obviously that's a call for immigration reform, but inaddition, is he asking the Justice Department to look into whether ornot they should block this law? TUCKER: No, I think they are looking -- first of all, I think theJustice Department lawyers and the Civil Rights Division probably spentthe weekend trying to figure out what they can do, looking at the billitself, the law now, and trying to figure out where there might be civilrights violations. Unreasonable search and seizure is one place forthem to look. But the Justice Department doesn't have to do anything. There willbe other organizations that have already said that they are planninglawsuits against this. So it will be in court shortly. Let me say this about immigration reform, though. If we thoughthealth care reform was divisive, this is going to be an all-out battle,and will even create fissures in the Democratic Party. That's whySpeaker Pelosi has said we will act, but only if the Senate acts first. TAPPER: She's no fool. The Senate -- President Obama has beensaying -- pointing out that there were 11 Republican senators whosupported immigration reform in 2007 when it failed, and suggesting thatthey need to support it now. I don't think they're going to support it,though. KRUGMAN: Well, politically, though, this is one of those issuesthat cuts right through the middle of both parties. The Democrats, it'son the one hand, Democrats tend to be pro-labor, which means they areworried about immigration; on the other hand, they tend to be -- it isthe party that now gets most of the Hispanic votes, it's the party thatgenerally is for inclusiveness. So the Democrats are divided. Many ofthem divided within their own hearts. It's an interesting thing, it'snot so much different wings of the party as each individual Democrattends to be kind of torn about this. Republicans are divided between the sort of cultural conservativewing, the preserve America as the way it is, and the business wing,which likes having inexpensive immigrant labor. So this is one heck ofan issue. It's going to -- it's deeply divisive among both parties,which is one reason not to rush it, to push it at the top of the agendaright now. I'm kind of upset at the notion that this might push climate changeoff this year, because we don't do climate change legislation. I'mready for that one, George. If we don't do that this year, we won't doit for quite a few years to come. GLICK: I thought one of the most interesting things is SenatorMcCain's stance on this, someone who talked a lot on the campaign trailand has been very vocal about needing comprehensive immigration reform. I understand he's fighting a tight race and a tight battle there, but Ithought that was very telling, when you go back to what -- how will thisimpact the mid-term elections. Is this about what will happen to thatHispanic vote? Is this about what you need to do in these short-termelections to get the necessary votes? I thought that was a very tellingsign that in the last hours, he decided to back it. WILL: But the problem, as in my judgment with health care, is thatword comprehensive. Instead of making little, bite-sized, incrementalimprovements, we have to do everything at once. That's partly becausethis is all being held hostage by the immigrant advocacy groups in thecountry. But if we would close the border, guarantee that we were notgoing to have serial amnesties far into the future--GLICK: So put the 3,000 troops on the border as McCain suggests. WILL: Build a fence, do what McCain suggests, and you'll find thatthe American people are not xenophobic, they are not irrational on thesubject, but they do want this essential attribute of nationalsovereignty asserted. TUCKER: And where does the money come from for that, George? WILL: It's a rounding error on the GM bailout. TUCKER: Sealing the border would be much more difficult thanadvocates for that idea suggest. It's a very long border, 2,000 miles,George. TAPPER: We're only talking about the southern border, right? We'renot trying to keep the Canadians out? TUCKER: The southern border---WILL: You're profiling. (CROSSTALK)KRUGMAN: -- different from you and me, eh? TUCKER: And technology doesn't work that we thought we can dependon, doesn't work nearly as well as its advocates suggested either. Sowe're talking about people, standing up border guards, National Guard,Army troops on the border if we really want to seal it off. KRUGMAN: The truth is, in the modern world, sealing borders is alot harder than you want to imagine. Nobody is able to keep out atleast a fair amount of illegal immigration. The Europeans can't. TheJapanese can't. Japan is an island, and it's very easy to tell who'snot Japanese, and even so they have a lot of illegal immigrants. GLICK: But you can see to George's point of view, as I was sayingto you guys before, when I sent out a message on Twitter about this andI said to people, what do you think about immigration reform? A lot ofthe messages I got back were from people in Arizona who say they supportthis bill because they see what's going on, on a day-to-day basis. Now, I don't agree with it. I think there is a very dangerousprecedent being set, but what it does show you is that more and morestates, particularly on the border there, are going to have to addressthis on their own if we don't take it up as a bigger issue. TAPPER: I want to get to one other state very, very quickly,because we only have a couple of minutes, and that is in the next week,we're going to have a decision from the governor of Florida, CharlieCrist, who is running for Senate, about whether or not he's going todrop out of the race. The latest Quinnipiac poll shows that the formerspeaker of the Florida House, Marco Rubio, would wallop Crist in theRepublican primary, 56 percent to 33 percent. But if Crist runs as anindependent, George, Crist 32 percent; Rubio 30 percent; DemocraticCongressman Kendrick Meek, 24 percent. Very quickly, isn't this hisonly option? WILL: No. He can lose honorably, as has happened before with otherpeople, wait two years, and run against an incumbent Democrat, SenatorNelson. Or having experienced a 50-point swing against him in about sixmonths, he can go off. He has already lost his campaign manager, formerSenator Connie Mack. He's infuriated by vetoing an education reformbill to curry favor with the teachers unions Jeb Bush, the most popularpolitician in the state. This is hara-kiri on the part of this man. TAPPER: Paul, very quickly. KRUGMAN: This is the narrowing of the Republican Party. RepublicanParty has swung hard right. There is no room for a moderatelyconservative but still middle-of-the-road politician in it, and CharlieCrist has just found that out, rather late in the game I might say. TAPPER: Cynthia? TUCKER: You know, he has -- his politics haven't changed. He hasalways worked across the aisle with Democrats. He's always beenmoderately conservative. But this shows how much the Republican Partyin Florida has changed. It's that hug, when President Obama came toFlorida to talk about the stimulus package, there was that moment invideo where they did a man hug, and that is killing Charlie Crist andthe Republican Party. TAPPER: Alexis, very quickly, how much of this is about thestimulus, about the fact that Crist embraced the stimulus? GLICK: Absolutely bingo to me. This is the perfect example forRepublicans across the country who will say, hey, look, I didn't supportthe stimulus package. Look at what's happening to a guy who did supportit. I think that's going to be a big issue of debate here. And I alsothink the second issue is Tea Party. Rubio supported by the Tea Party. If the Republicans want to figure out how to embrace Tea Partycandidates, here's an example. TAPPER: All right, well, the roundtable will continue in the greenroom on abcnews.com, where you can also check out our fact checks. TAPPER: Good morning, everyone. Tomorrow, the Senate is scheduledto hold its first vote on the biggest overhaul in decades of thenation's financial system, changes that could impact your savings, yourpension, maybe even your job. This as a big Wall Street investment bankcomes under attack on Tuesday. Executives from Goldman Sachs, which isalready facing government accusations of fraud, will testify before aSenate committee investigating whether the firm profited from themassive housing crash at the expense of its clients. Joining me this morning, three key players in the middle of thisstorm. GOOLSBEE: Thanks for having us. CORKER: Good morning. Good to be with you. Senator Brown, I want to ask you. What do these emails signify to you? BROWN: Well, these emails signify that there are all kinds ofconflicts of interest on Wall Street, that there are -- that WallStreet, while working for its clients and working against its clients inthe same sort of bundled toxic securities, and that's why we need theVolcker rule. That's why we need really strong reform that willseparate the proprietary trading from banking functions. I think thatsays it more articulately and more forcefully, that example, thananything we've seen so far. TAPPER: Senator Corker, doesn't Senator Brown have a point? Thisis exactly why people think that proprietary trading, that is when abank uses its own money to invest, should not be the same, it should notbe in the same firm as trading for commercial banking, for clients? That there is an inbred conflict of interest there. CORKER: Well, I can understand the sentiment. I know thatcertainly the emails do not read well. I look forward to seeing whatthe SEC investigation brings forth, and the Senate investigation throughthis subcommittee brings forth. At the end of the day, though, some ofthat has to do with making markets. I am in no way defending sort ofthe attitude expressed in the emails, but I think we're better offwaiting to see exactly what has taken place. I think, you know, at the end of the day, instruments are set up onWall Street. People take either side of it. There are some conflictsof interest that can exist and do need to be looked at, but I'd ratherwait and see how this investigation unfolds before making any judgments. TAPPER: Austan, is there anything in the legislation that Democratsare pushing that President Obama wants to pass, is there anything thatwould have prevented what Goldman Sachs is accused of having committed? GOOLSBEE: You know, I don't know the exact details, but there are anumber of things that would go directly at the heart of some of theseissues that are raised in these cases, like with securitizations, thatthe people who originate the securities have to maintain some ownershipso that if they pack it full of things that are going to fail, theythemselves are going to lose money when they do it. I'm certainly notgoing to comment on independent, you know, regulatory investigations,but these emails that are released, the CEO of Goldman is not going towin any popularity contests when over a period that ordinary Americans'pensions, houses et cetera were collapsing in value, they were actuallymaking significant money off of it. If that's true, I think SenatorBrown's point, that we've got to end the conflicts of interest and thatthe Volcker rule is really on point on that I think is also highly relevant. TAPPER: Senator Corker, the status of the Wall Street reform bill. Right now, the members of the Senate Banking Committee are negotiating. Tomorrow, the majority leader, Harry Reid, is scheduled to bring it upfor a vote. Do you think there will be a bipartisan compromise beforethat vote happens, and if not, are all 41 Republicans going to standagainst proceeding to a debate? CORKER: Look, first of all, I think everybody knows, Sherrod sureknows I want to see a bill. I think we do need to address regulation inour financial markets. You know, it's in play right now. The fact is,I know that Shelby and Dodd are actually on another program thismorning. After that program, I know they're going to continue meeting,hopefully getting to a compromise before tomorrow evening. And I think what we need to do is have a template. We don't need toaddress every issue in this compromise, but one that deals withderivatives, one that deals with consumer protection, and one that dealswith this orderly liquidation. If we can get that template agreed to ina bipartisan way, then we can debate some of the amendments that SherrodBrown wants to bring forth, some of the amendments I want to bringforth. But I think it's very, very important that we reach thatbipartisan agreement first, because in the Senate, as you know, it takes60 votes to change anything. This is something, by the way, that everyone has committed to try todo, and that is to have this bipartisan agreement before it goes to thefloor. I think it's important that we do so. TAPPER: So if there is no bipartisan agreement, Republicans willblock the motion to proceed to debating this bill? CORKER: I think that's very likely. And I do want to say that wevoted this bill, 1336 pages, we voted it out of committee in 21 minuteswith no amendments, with the understanding that before the bill came tothe floor, we would reach this bipartisan agreement. So again, we just want to see what was stated honored. And I knowSherrod Brown and Austan both know I want to see a bill. But I think,again, having this template done first is very, very important. It'svery likely, I think it's almost a given, that if we don't reach thatbipartisan agreement, that Republicans will probably want to put inplace something that allows those negotiations to keep going for a whileuntil we do that. So yes, 41 Republicans in my opinion would block itunless we reached this agreement, which we've all stated needs to occur. TAPPER: Senator Brown, let me ask you a question about thelegislation itself. I have a copy of it here, and it says right at thetop of the bill that the purpose is to promote the financial stabilityof the United States by improving accountability and transparency in thefinancial system, to end too-big-to-fail, and for other purposes. Senator Brown, does this bill end too-big-to-fail? BROWN: Yes, it does. It can do it better, and Senator Corker waspart of the negotiations that deal with the resolution authority. TAPPER: Just to interject, the resolution authority is for thefederal government to come in, and if there is a failing financialsystem, to take over and liquidate that firm. I'm sorry, Senator Brown,go on. BROWN: But let me go back to something Bob just said, then I'llanswer the question more specifically. You know, some Wall Streetpeople have said the longer they can delay this, the more chance theycan kill it. And I just don't want to see it delayed. We've been --two years ago was the Bear Stearns problem. Ever since then, SenatorDodd in November put out a working draft. He then put teams together,including Senator Corker and Senator Warner and Gregg and others andSenator Dodd and Shelby, and it's -- and Senator Reed, and Jack Reed waspart of that too -- so we've been working on this for a long time. I hope that tomorrow night when we have a vote -- all we're askingtomorrow night is 60 votes. We need a Republican or two or three tosimply say, let's move forward and debate, and then Bob Corker and I andothers can offer any kinds of amendments we want. So I hope that theywill not en masse -- and put it this way, I wish there were more BobCorkers in the Senate Republican caucus, because he's been very openwith negotiations. And then Senator Shelby and Senator -- MinorityLeader McConnell pulled them back, I think on behalf of Wall Streetlobbyists. But put that aside, in terms of too-big-to-fail, we do have thisresolution authority. It's well done, written by Senator Corker andSenator Dodd and some others bipartisanly. I think we need to do moreto prevent too big, though. Too-big-to-fail is too big, and myamendment that Senator Kaufman from Delaware and I are offering nextweek or the week after will basically say that we'll put some limits onthe size of these banks. Let me give you one statistic, if I could, Jake. Fifteen years ago,the six -- the assets of the six largest banks in this country totaled17 percent of GDP, 17 percent of GDP. The assets of the six largestbanks in the United States today total 63 percent of GDP, and that's too-- we've got to deal with risk to be sure, but we've got to deal withthe size of these banks, because if one of these banks is in serioustrouble, it will have such a ripple effect on the whole economy. So wesimply can't let them get this big and have this kind of economic powerover Main Street, over a small business in Canton, Ohio, or a worker --a manufacturing plant in Dayton. I mean, we just can't let this happen. TAPPER: And Austan, Senator Brown is going to introduce anamendment that would cap the amount a bank can borrow to financeoperations at 2 percent of GDP, 2 percent of the gross domesticproduct. Wouldn't that actually stop too-big-to-fail by preventingthese banks from being too big? And why isn't the administration behindthat? GOOLSBEE: Well, the president is totally committed and it's one ofhis key principles that we're going to end too-big-to-fail, we're goingto end the bailout era that began under the last president, for good. That's not going to happen anymore. We can open -- we're open tonegotiating details obviously as we start getting into it. They'recomplicated. Some of these financial risks are more like worms whereyou could chop them in half, but it doesn't kill them, it just gives youtwo different worms. Bear Stearns, AIG, they weren't the biggest, theywere just the most dangerous, and we've got to come at this from every side. Look, we're open to looking at ending too-big-to-fail on the sizeangle, on the what risky investments they're allowed to take, looking atthe derivatives component so that AIG-like, they can't threaten to blowup the whole world because of -- because they have some of this $600trillion pool of derivatives that we know virtually nothing about, thatare in the dark. All of that ends when we sign this bill. If you lookat the bill and take a step back -- I don't know much about thelegislative strategies that are going on in the Senate. They areimportant. I do know that the president has laid out what this billdoes, is we're going to end bailouts, we're going to hold accountablethe people that get into the messes. So if they get in trouble, theyfail. All we're going to do is pay funeral expenses, and we're going tohave the strongest consumer protections ever in this country. TAPPER: Let me stop you right there, because you said that we'regoing to hold accountable the people that get us into these messes. ButSenator Corker, I think one of the problems that a lot of the Americanpeople have with bailouts and with this legislation is that they feelthat after these firms fail, or are propped up by the U.S. taxpayer,they take billions of taxpayer dollars, then the CEOs and the boardmembers drive off in their Austin Martins to their $20 million houses inthe Hamptons with their $500 million in the bank, and there's noaccountability whatsoever. Is there anything in this bill that providesany personal accountability for these CEOs? CORKER: Before I answer that, let me refer to something SenatorBrown said. I -- nobody pulled me back from negotiations. The fact isthat Senator Dodd, and he said this publicly, left me at the altar. Andthe reason was, as we negotiated, Democrats were being lost, and I thinkhe wanted to get the bill out of committee on a party-line vote. Imean, he has stated that publicly. So nobody has pulled me back. I'mmy own person and I want to get a good bill here. But back to the question you're asking. There is no question, and Ithink that first of all, I plan to offer changes to this resolutionauthority that say that, if a large entity like this has to go throughthis resolution where in essence they're liquidated in an orderly way, Ithink that everything that the executive team and the board members haveearned through this company over the last five years needs to be clawedback. In other words, there needs to be some penalties assessed to themanagement that have caused the country to have to go through thisorderly liquidation process. So absolutely, I will be offering anamendment that deals with that, so that we're taking back, we're clawingback all the earnings that management has made out of this firm, if ithas to go through orderly liquidation. I think that's very appropriate,and certainly I'm going to be doing that on the floor if it doesn't makeit into the base bill. TAPPER: Austan, can the White House get behind that clawbackprovision? Are you being out-populisted by Republicans? TAPPER: But there is no clawback in this bill? GOOLSBEE: There is a requirement that they're all fired. TAPPER: So they take their $500 million to their home in the Hamptons. GOOLSBEE: -- all the shareholders are wiped out. Well, look, as Isay, on any details, we're open to looking at negotiating the details ofhow we carry out the president's principles. But if negotiation -- andSenator Corker, to his credit, is not in this camp -- but if thenegotiators are going to come forward more as a delaying tactic andwe're just going to put in hundreds of amendments and try to keep thisgoing so as to stall, delay and kill reform, that's not going tohappen. This is going to pass. TAPPER: One of the big -- let me just move on to another subject ifI could, but we will get back to you, Senator Corker. One of the bigdebates going on within the Democratic caucus is how strong thederivative legislation should be. Derivatives are these risky bets thatbig money men and women make on whether or not an industry will rise orfall in value, and it's a way to hedge a lot of risk. Senator Brown, you are in favor of Senator Lincoln's provision,Blanche Lincoln from Arkansas. She wants to say, if you're a bank andyou have federally insured money, you have to separate these derivativestraders. It's too risky what they do. We should not have anyconnection with taxpayer insured money. Do you think that the Democratsare going to put that in the bill? And if not, why not? BROWN: Well, I hope so and I think so. I -- this goes back toreally your first question on the conflicts of interest on Wall Street,that you really can't serve two masters. You can't serve your clientsand serve yourself and play these transactions one off against another. And I think that these -- anything we do in this bill, whether it'sconsumer protection standalone -- I hope that the Consumer ProtectionAgency, whether it's regulation of derivatives, whether it'stoo-big-to-fail, whether it's the Volcker rule separating outproprietary trading and, as I say, from standard banking practices. Anyof those conflicts of interests, we have to address in this bill, and Ithink that -- I think that Senator Lincoln and her draft in theAgriculture Committee that we voted out last week, we got one Republicansupporting it, Senator Grassley did. And I think that was a good sign. I think it means that there will be a number of Republicans that are asopen-minded as Senator Corker, that will want to move forward Mondaynight. And again, just to let us begin the debate. I mean, the Monday voteis going to be -- are we going to start the debate or are we going toshut it down and continue negotiating, negotiating, negotiating. I, tome, the legislative process is, you put a bill on the floor and then BobCorker offers his amendment that I like that he just mentioned, in termsof in the resolution authority, what to do with these executives thatbrought us there. I offer my amendment on too-big-to-fail means toobig. Dozens of other amendments will be offered, we'll see whathappens, and then we vote on a bill. TAPPER: Austan, can you get behind Senator Lincoln's provision toseparate derivatives trading from banks that have federally insureddeposits? GOOLSBEE: If you take a step back, this issue of derivatives istotally central. Now, three years ago, virtually no one in America hadeven heard of derivatives, or if they had, they had nightmares of their,you know, college math class or something. The fact is that there arenow $600 trillion of derivatives that are trading in the dark, that weknow virtually nothing about and are unregulated. And it's not just aparty that's taking place on Wall Street that has no impact on America. They're exactly the things that threatened to blow up the entirefinancial system with AIG. So the president's completely committed thatwe are going to bring the $600 trillion out into the open and under theregulatory umbrella. Now, I think we made great progress that in both the Dodd andLincoln's versions of what would happen with derivatives, we purged abunch of the loopholes that some of the banks had gotten put into thebills before. The president is not going to allow putting loopholes inthat let these $600 trillion get back into the dark and threaten thewhole system. TAPPER: -- don't support separating it, though, right? GOOLSBEE: I don't agree with that. TAPPER: It's whether or not commercial banks should be able to dothis. TAPPER: You think Senator Lincoln's provision goes a little toofar, right? Senator Corker? TAPPER: Yes, yes, of course, Senator Corker. CORKER: Yes. Yes, I mean, I think what -- I think what Austan issaying is he doesn't support it. And I don't either. Let me say this,I want to see as much traded through clearinghouses as possible. Iabsolutely agree that that needs to occur. We don't want to force thosethings that are not liquid to be traded on the clearinghouse, but I'm onthe side of let's get as much as possible. The fact is that Senator Brown is in a state where a lot ofmanufacturing takes place. I'm in a state where a lot of manufacturingtakes place. And what people don't I think appreciate so much is thatall of these tools are used for capital formation. They help companieshedge their risk. They help companies create capital, and I think if westart drawing lines in the sand where we take these tools away, what wereally do is hamper companies' ability to access capital. So I don'tthink separation is appropriate. I do think clearing as much aspossible so that on a daily basis, if somebody is money bad, they haveto put money up to be money good or neutral, so that we don't end up inthe kind of situation we have with AIG. But I think it hampers ourability, again, to create great companies if we just create an absoluteseparation. TAPPER: Unfortunately, that's all the time we have. It was a greatdebate, and I really thank you, Senator Corker in Chattanooga, SenatorBrown in Cincinnati and Austan Goolsbee here in the studio. Thanks somuch for joining us. Really appreciate it. As our roundtable takes their seats, take a look at how SaturdayNight Live portrayed the president's speech on Thursday, pitching reformto Wall Street executives. TAPPER: And we're joined now by our roundtable, as always. GeorgeWill, Cynthia Tucker of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Paul Krugmanof the New York Times and Alexis Glick, former vice president at FoxBusiness News. Thank you all for joining us. George, does this legislation end too-big-to-fail? WILL: No, because that's not the problem. It's -- we all sort ofsympathize with Sherrod Brown and Senator Kaufman's idea that if it'stoo big to fail, it's too big to exist. The problem is it's not scale,it's connectedness that poses so-called system risk. And what peopleare arguing about is whether or not they have accurately located risk tothe entire system. This is an unusual argument. Usually in Washington when there'scontroversy about a bill, the two sides agree about what the bill doesbut not whether it ought to be done. In this case, there's an argumentabout whether or not the bill will actually do what it sets out to do. Both sides want to guarantee the obliteration of certain kinds offailed firms. They want the management to go and they want shareholderequity to disappear. So it's a competition to see who can be mostbeastly to these bad companies. And the question is whether or not thishappens. TAPPER: Cynthia, it's unclear right now if there's going to be abipartisan compromise, but you heard Senator Corker say that thenegotiations should continue. You don't really have a lot of faith inthat. TUCKER: No, and the Democrats don't either, for good reason. Wesaw this tactic used with health care reform, when Max Baucus was givenmonths to negotiate with Republicans. At the end of the day therewasn't a single Senate Republican voting for health care reform. So,you know, Mitch McConnell came out just a few weeks ago and said, let'sstart over with this financial reform bill. That was the very sametactic used with health care reform. So Democrats need to be leery ofthis idea of negotiate, negotiate, negotiate. It gives the lobbyiststime to lobby more, give more campaign contributions, and it gives theRepublicans time to foment opposition by mischaracterizing the bill. SoI think Chris Dodd is very leery. TAPPER: Can I interject for one second on the campaigncontributions, and I'll come to you in a second, Paul. But the Centerfor Responsive Politics did a study of campaign contributions, and inthis cycle, the finance, insurance and real estate sectors are givingmuch more to Democrats than to Republicans. $65 million to $51million. Paul, do you think the Democratic Party is too close to WallStreet? KRUGMAN: Well, it has been in the past for sure. No question thatin the late '90s, the Clinton team -- some of whom are now in theadministration -- were way too close to Wall Street. They believed thatthese were wise men who knew what they were doing. And no, at thispoint, it's the party in power, of course, is going to be getting a lotmore contributions. It's kind of -- that's not too surprising. Let me say a couple of things here. Anyone who says we need to bebipartisan should bear in mind that for the last several weeks, MitchMcConnell, the Senate minority leader, has been trying to stop reformwith possibly the most dishonest argument ever made in the history ofpolitics, which is the claim that having regulation of the banks isactually bailing out the banks. And basically, the argument boils downto saying that what we really need to do to deal with fires is abolishthe fire department. Because then people will know that they can't lettheir buildings burn in the first place, right? It's incredible. So anyone who says bipartisan, should say, you know, bipartisandoesn't include the Senate minority leader. But, you know, I agree withGeorge, actually, believe it or not. Too big to fail per se is not theproblem. The Great Depression was made possible by the failure of theBank of the United States, which despite its name, was a Bronx-basedinstitution that was the 28th largest financial institution in theUnited States at the time, and yet brought the whole system down. But what we are getting now in this bill is a way to have gracefulfailure of big institutions, right? We know how to deal with smallbanks. The FDIC seized seven banks last week that were on the verge offailing and let them, you know, liquidated them gracefully, but we don'thave a way of dealing with complex, you know, what we call shadowbanking institutions like Lehman or Citigroup. And this bill would giveyou that. So it would give you the ability to do for big, complicatedfinancial institutions what we've been doing routinely for small ones,and that does -- so it doesn't end the too big, but it may deal with thefail bit. TAPPER: Alexis, you, unlike a lot of business journalists, actuallyhave worked in business. You've done trading at Goldman Sachs, atMorgan Stanley. What do you think of this regulation bill? Do youthink the derivatives monitoring and separation that Senator Lincoln istrying to do, do you think that goes too far? GLICK: Well, look, bottom line is, I think when you look at thederivative equation, do we need transparency? Should there be a centralclearing facility? Absolutely. It is without a doubt the wild west. It is all about that shadow banking market, that black market. We havenot been able to see who is on the other side of that transaction. I do believe that it's going too far to say that large financialinstitutions cannot have a derivative business. Believe you me, I don'twant to see one American deposit in this country used as a tool to goout on a proprietary basis for a firm's capital to go out and trade inderivatives. I don't like that. But when you come back to this too bigto fail, just to pick up on what you said, the FDIC has done aphenomenal job throughout this financial crisis. No depositor has losta dime. They've been able to wind down financial institutions in avery, very smart and effective way. TAPPER: The ability of the government -- I told you I'll do this --the ability of the government to step in and wind down a financialinstitution that's failing. Go. GLICK: Good job! The bill -- the question here is all those otherinstitutions who have a financial arm, as we talked about earlier. It'sthe GM situations where they have a finance arm, it's the GE Capitals ofthe world. Where do these guys fit into this equation when they may bein the manufacturing business or in other business? WILL: That's precisely what worries Republicans. They think thisis a thin end of an enormous wedge that is going to get the governmentdeeper into treating capital and credit in this country as a publicutility, to be priced and allocated here in Washington, which is, theythink, inevitably a recipe for something like crony capitalism. Becauseyou have somewhat not slippery, but open-textured definitions. Non-bankfinancial institution. Well, GMAC gets General Motors brought underTARP, and in this case, GE Capital would get all of General Electric, orwould it? We don't know. Would it be a segment of General Electricbrought under this bill? KRUGMAN: And yet there's no alternative. Meaning if we onlyprotect banks in the traditional sense, which are big marble buildingswith rows of tellers, you're missing 60 percent of the modern bankingsystem. The fact of the matter is, there are lots of things out there,money market funds, repo. (inaudible), but things that functionallyplay the same role as bank deposits, that can destabilize the economythe same way as bank deposits, and so we have to bring those under theumbrella. Now, we can quibble with details, but something like this hasto be done. TAPPER: Let me just interject for one second. We're going to takea quick break. And when we come back, our roundtable will take upArizona's crackdown on illegal immigrants and what will the impact be onimmigration reform. And later, the Sunday funnies. JAY LENO: He just played golf for the 32nd time in his presidency. He sent more troops to Iraq, wants more oil drilling, gave billions toWall Street. Rush Limbaugh said he wanted a Republican president, hegot one. TAPPER: Coming up next, more of the ""Roundtable"" and of course the""Sunday Funnies."" BREWER: I have decided to sign Senate bill 1070 into law. Orderrelated violence and crimes due to illegal immigration are criticallyimportant issue for the people of our state. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People are angry. People feel held down. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Federal government isn't doing anything for us. The state has to do something. SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, R-ARIZ.: Our border is not secure, our citizensare not safe. OBAMA: The failure to act responsibly at the federal level willonly open the door to irresponsibility by others. That includes, forexample, the recent efforts in Arizona which threaten to undermine basicnotions of fairness that we cherish as Americans. TAPPER: Some sound from the heated debate over Arizona's newimmigration law. Fodder for us here on our ""Roundtable."" We're joinedas always by George Will, Cynthia Tucker of the ""AtlantaJournal-Constitution,"" Paul Krugman of the ""New York Times,"" and formervice president of FOX Business News, Alexis Glick. That's a mouth full but I got it every time. Let me start before wediscuss this bill and what it actually does by going into one of themost controversial provisions in this new law, Arizona Senate bill1070. ""For any lawful contact made by a law enforcement official, wherereasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien who isunlawfully present in the United States, s reasonable attempt shall bemade when practicable to determine the immigration status of the person."" ""Reasonable suspicion"" that the person is an alien. What does thatmean, George? WILL: Well, the Fourth Amendment says there should be nounreasonable searches and seizures, and we've generated volumes of caselaw trying to sort out what that means over the last century or so. Soit's not clear what that means. Let's say this about Arizona. Theyhave 460,000, an estimated 460,000 illegal immigrants there. So beforeWashington lectures Arizonans on irresponsibility, perhaps Washingtonought to attend to the central attribute of national sovereignty whichis to control the borders. We are the only developed nation in theworld with a 2,000 mile border with an undeveloped country and we have amagnet of a welfare state to the north. So this is not Arizona's fault. Beyond that, this should be saidhowever. Reasonable suspicion is going to put upon the police ofArizona a terribly difficult job. This is what the governor said. ""Wemust enforce the law evenly and without regard to skin color, accent orsocial status."" I don't know how do you that. TAPPER: Well Cynthia, how do you do that? The governor put out anexecutive order saying that there should be no racial order that thereshould be no racial profiling with this law. But if you're a police manand you've been told -- and by the way, you can be sued now under thislaw if you're not doing enough, if the citizens are convinced you're notdoing enough to crack down on illegal immigration. If you're apoliceman, what's enough? What's reasonable to think somebody might bean illegal immigrant? TUCKER: Well Jake, several law enforcement agencies have actuallyopposed the bill. Not only for that reason because they have no ideawhat it means to say reasonable suspicion. A California Republican hassaid you can tell an illegal immigrant by the shoes they wear. Ofcourse this is an invitation to racial profiling. Everyone with aSpanish surname, everyone with a certain look, you may or may not beLatino. There are people in my family who look as if they could beLatino. It harkens back to apartheid where all black people in SouthAfrica were required to carry documents in order to move from one partof town to another. And let me just say this about Arizona's problems with the border,it is absolutely true that Arizona has problems with the border. Arancher was killed apparently by drug smugglers. But this hasabsolutely no bearing on that problem. All it does is open the doorsfor harassment of citizens. TAPPER: Let's you talk about that rancher for a second. His namewas Robert Krentz and he was killed in March. Here's a friend of him,Steve Brophy, talking about his friend's death. STEVE BROPHY, KRENTZ'S FRIEND: You cannot allow a border in ourcountry that is akin in lawlessness to that of west Waziristan inPakistan. It's simply intolerable, not just for Rob Krentz and not justfor the Krentz family but for her entire country. TAPPER: Doesn't he have a point, Paul? I mean this is federalfailure at the border. KRUGMAN: Yes, we have never put in enough money is basically whatit comes down to enforce the border control. It's not a deep issue ofprinciple, it's just a question of resources. People have been willingto be very -- talk tough about it but actually not willing to doreasonable stuff in terms of enforcement. And it's going to be aproblem. But what I want to go back to here is not just apartheidissues, but think about a different way. We have these massive protests in this country about allegedauthoritarian tendencies that we are going to have some kind of --inside the Obama/Hitler stuff -- the idea that the government isencroaching too much in our lives. And now all of the sudden, we have by pretty much the same people,demanding that we set up a system that will turn us into one of thoseapocryphal foreign authoritarian regimes where the police are sayinghand over your papers, right? A world where you constantly have toprove who you are. And yes, it will be racial profiling but who knowswhat else? I mean, some people take me I look like President Lula ofBrazil, so I might end up being pulled over when I'm on my morning walk,right? TAPPER: I think you're much better looking than the president ofBrazil. TAPPER: But you know, it's interesting that you say that, becauseyou are not the only one to evoke that, let me see your papers thing. TAPPER: Cardinal Roger Mahoney on his blog wrote, quote, ""Americanpeople are fair-minded and respectful. I can't imagine Arizonans nowreverting to German Nazi and Russian Communist techniques whereby peopleare required to turn one another in to the authorities on any suspicionof documentation."" And now, Alexis, we have Senator Harry Reid and President Obamatalking about immigration reform again. We thought it was dead, wethought it wasn't going to be brought up, but it looks like this isgoing to be a big issue in Washington. GLICK: You know, I think at first glance, most people say, hey,wait a second. We're been trying to tackle too much too quickly. Butthe bottom line here is if -- this is a bill that will be the catalyst,if what has happened in Arizona is the thing that gets people moving inWashington, D.C. to address things like the border, then so be it. I saw Senator Lindsey Graham came out the other day and said, oh,wait a second, I've been working, I'm not going to show up at theconference on cap-and-trade because we said cap-and-trade is firstbefore we're going to address -- or climate change is first before we'regoing to address immigration. The bottom line, we have to addressimmigration. 11 million immigrants in this country. We have got anunemployment rate in this country at 26-, 27-year high. We have toaddress citizens and what they are going to take of the piece of thepie, what they should get in addition to what taxes they should get,what services they're going to be offered. This is an issue that has been plaguing us. We have got to addressit. WILL: Again, in defense of Arizona, large majority of Arizonanssupport this bill and a large majority of Arizonans are not, bydefinition, the fringe of the state. They are temperate, decent peoplewith a huge problem. What the Arizona law does is make a state crime out of somethingthat already is a crime, a federal crime. Now, the Arizona police --and I've spent time with the Phoenix Police Department -- these are notbad people. These are professionals who are used to making the kind ofdifficult judgments. Suspicion of intoxicated driving, all kinds ofjudgments are constantly made by policemen. And I wouldn't despairaltogether their ability to do this in a professional way. TAPPER: And we should point out, some police organizations inArizona do support it, although Cynthia, it's interesting, PresidentObama had this to say on the North Lawn of the White House, or, I'msorry, in the Rose Garden of the White House the other day, even beforethe law was passed. OBAMA: I've instructed members of my administration to closelymonitor the situation and examine the civil rights and otherimplications of this legislation. But if we continue to fail to act ata federal level, we will continue to see misguided efforts opening uparound the country. TAPPER: Obviously that's a call for immigration reform, but inaddition, is he asking the Justice Department to look into whether ornot they should block this law? TUCKER: No, I think they are looking -- first of all, I think theJustice Department lawyers and the Civil Rights Division probably spentthe weekend trying to figure out what they can do, looking at the billitself, the law now, and trying to figure out where there might be civilrights violations. Unreasonable search and seizure is one place forthem to look. But the Justice Department doesn't have to do anything. There willbe other organizations that have already said that they are planninglawsuits against this. So it will be in court shortly. Let me say this about immigration reform, though. If we thoughthealth care reform was divisive, this is going to be an all-out battle,and will even create fissures in the Democratic Party. That's whySpeaker Pelosi has said we will act, but only if the Senate acts first. TAPPER: She's no fool. The Senate -- President Obama has beensaying -- pointing out that there were 11 Republican senators whosupported immigration reform in 2007 when it failed, and suggesting thatthey need to support it now. I don't think they're going to support it,though. KRUGMAN: Well, politically, though, this is one of those issuesthat cuts right through the middle of both parties. The Democrats, it'son the one hand, Democrats tend to be pro-labor, which means they areworried about immigration; on the other hand, they tend to be -- it isthe party that now gets most of the Hispanic votes, it's the party thatgenerally is for inclusiveness. So the Democrats are divided. Many ofthem divided within their own hearts. It's an interesting thing, it'snot so much different wings of the party as each individual Democrattends to be kind of torn about this. Republicans are divided between the sort of cultural conservativewing, the preserve America as the way it is, and the business wing,which likes having inexpensive immigrant labor. So this is one heck ofan issue. It's going to -- it's deeply divisive among both parties,which is one reason not to rush it, to push it at the top of the agendaright now. I'm kind of upset at the notion that this might push climate changeoff this year, because we don't do climate change legislation. I'mready for that one, George. If we don't do that this year, we won't doit for quite a few years to come. GLICK: I thought one of the most interesting things is SenatorMcCain's stance on this, someone who talked a lot on the campaign trailand has been very vocal about needing comprehensive immigration reform. I understand he's fighting a tight race and a tight battle there, but Ithought that was very telling, when you go back to what -- how will thisimpact the mid-term elections. Is this about what will happen to thatHispanic vote? Is this about what you need to do in these short-termelections to get the necessary votes? I thought that was a very tellingsign that in the last hours, he decided to back it. WILL: But the problem, as in my judgment with health care, is thatword comprehensive. Instead of making little, bite-sized, incrementalimprovements, we have to do everything at once. That's partly becausethis is all being held hostage by the immigrant advocacy groups in thecountry. GLICK: So put the 3,000 troops on the border as McCain suggests. WILL: Build a fence, do what McCain suggests, and you'll find thatthe American people are not xenophobic, they are not irrational on thesubject, but they do want this essential attribute of nationalsovereignty asserted. TUCKER: And where does the money come from for that, George? WILL: It's a rounding error on the GM bailout. TUCKER: Sealing the border would be much more difficult thanadvocates for that idea suggest. It's a very long border, 2,000 miles,George. TAPPER: We're only talking about the southern border, right? We'renot trying to keep the Canadians out? WILL: You're profiling. KRUGMAN: -- different from you and me, eh? TUCKER: And technology doesn't work that we thought we can dependon, doesn't work nearly as well as its advocates suggested either. Sowe're talking about people, standing up border guards, National Guard,Army troops on the border if we really want to seal it off. KRUGMAN: The truth is, in the modern world, sealing borders is alot harder than you want to imagine. Nobody is able to keep out atleast a fair amount of illegal immigration. The Europeans can't. TheJapanese can't. Japan is an island, and it's very easy to tell who'snot Japanese, and even so they have a lot of illegal immigrants. GLICK: But you can see to George's point of view, as I was sayingto you guys before, when I sent out a message on Twitter about this andI said to people, what do you think about immigration reform? A lot ofthe messages I got back were from people in Arizona who say they supportthis bill because they see what's going on, on a day-to-day basis. Now, I don't agree with it. I think there is a very dangerousprecedent being set, but what it does show you is that more and morestates, particularly on the border there, are going to have to addressthis on their own if we don't take it up as a bigger issue. TAPPER: I want to get to one other state very, very quickly,because we only have a couple of minutes, and that is in the next week,we're going to have a decision from the governor of Florida, CharlieCrist, who is running for Senate, about whether or not he's going todrop out of the race. The latest Quinnipiac poll shows that the formerspeaker of the Florida House, Marco Rubio, would wallop Crist in theRepublican primary, 56 percent to 33 percent. But if Crist runs as anindependent, George, Crist 32 percent; Rubio 30 percent; DemocraticCongressman Kendrick Meek, 24 percent. Very quickly, isn't this hisonly option? WILL: No. He can lose honorably, as has happened before with otherpeople, wait two years, and run against an incumbent Democrat, SenatorNelson. Or having experienced a 50-point swing against him in about sixmonths, he can go off. He has already lost his campaign manager, formerSenator Connie Mack. He's infuriated by vetoing an education reformbill to curry favor with the teachers unions Jeb Bush, the most popularpolitician in the state. This is hara-kiri on the part of this man. TAPPER: Paul, very quickly. KRUGMAN: This is the narrowing of the Republican Party. RepublicanParty has swung hard right. There is no room for a moderatelyconservative but still middle-of-the-road politician in it, and CharlieCrist has just found that out, rather late in the game I might say. TUCKER: You know, he has -- his politics haven't changed. He hasalways worked across the aisle with Democrats. He's always beenmoderately conservative. But this shows how much the Republican Partyin Florida has changed. It's that hug, when President Obama came toFlorida to talk about the stimulus package, there was that moment invideo where they did a man hug, and that is killing Charlie Crist andthe Republican Party. TAPPER: Alexis, very quickly, how much of this is about thestimulus, about the fact that Crist embraced the stimulus? GLICK: Absolutely bingo to me. This is the perfect example forRepublicans across the country who will say, hey, look, I didn't supportthe stimulus package. Look at what's happening to a guy who did supportit. I think that's going to be a big issue of debate here. And I alsothink the second issue is Tea Party. Rubio supported by the Tea Party.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. LARRY KING, HOST: Tonight... (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP FROM ""CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY,"" COURTESY OVERTURE FILMS) MICHAEL MOORE, FILMMAKER: This is Michael Moore. I am here to make a citizens arrest of the board of directors of AIG. (END VIDEO CLIP) KING: Michael Moore -- he's back and asking where your money went. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP FROM ""CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY,"" COURTESY OVERTURE FILMS) MOORE: We're here to get the money back for the American people. I've got more bags. $10 billion probably won't fit in here. And just drop it from a -- from the window. (END VIDEO CLIP) KING: Why is big business getting billions from the government when ordinary folks are losing their homes? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP FROM ""CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY,"" COURTESY OVERTURE FILMS) MOORE: But that's OK. If you can't repay it, we'll just take your house. (END VIDEO CLIP) KING: Their health. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP FROM ""CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY,"" COURTESY OVERTURE FILMS) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Twenty years of our lives have been spent fighting. (END VIDEO CLIP) KING: Their hope. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP FROM ""CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY,"" COURTESY OVERTURE FILMS) MOORE: Did I say retired? (END VIDEO CLIP) KING: Is capitalism the cause of an American nightmare, not key to the American dream? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP FROM ""CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY,"" COURTESY OVERTURE FILMS) MOORE: If one job doesn't pay all the bills, don't worry. You can get another one and another one and another one. (END VIDEO CLIP) KING: Michael Moore -- whether he's right on or dead wrong, he's next for the hour on LARRY KING LIVE. It has been 20 years since Michael Moore took on General Motors in ""Roger and Me."" He's still sticking it to big business for what he sees as the deliberate shafting of the little guy. Just take a look at ""Capitalism: A Love Story"". (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP FROM ""CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY,"" COURTESY OVERTURE FILMS) MOORE: We're here to get the money back for the American people. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I understand, sir. But you can't come in the back. MOORE: You can just take the bag? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. MOORE: Take it up there? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, absolutely not. MOORE: Fill it up. I've got more bags. $10 billion probably won't fit in here. We want our money back. (CROSSTALK) Have you seen this guy? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. Yes. MOORE: OK. We're -- we're here to make a citizen's arrest, actually. And just drop it from a -- from the window. And everywhere I went... I'm going to take it back to the U.S. Treasury right in this car. It's safe. You can trust me. (END VIDEO CLIP) KING: Here he is, Michael Moore. You've described this movie -- and I've seen this movie. And I'll tell you, whether people agree or disagree with it. Maybe we'll get people who disagree with it -- and there will be people who disagree -- this is a brilliant documentary. You are our number one propagandist, in the good sense that a propagandist presents their viewpoint very well. Maybe no one does it better. You describe this movie as the culmination of all the films you've made. Does that mean this is it? MOORE: No. I hope not. It means that, for 20 years, as you said, I've been doing this. I started out by showing people what General Motors was up to and how this was a company that was making a lot of bad decisions and it wasn't good for the company nor for the country. That was 20 years ago. And since then, I've covered a number of issues and different things. But it all seems to come back to this one issue of follow the money. Who's got the money? And whoever has the money has the power. And right now, in America, tonight, Larry, the richest 1 percent have more financial wealth than the bottom 95 percent combined. KING: You're in that 1 percent, though? MOORE: Well, I don't know if I'm in -- I don't think I'm in that 1 percent, but I... KING: No, 1 percent... MOORE: But I... KING: (INAUDIBLE). MOORE: I mean listen (INAUDIBLE) I make documentary films. But I mean, obviously, I do well because my films have done well. But, you know, I -- look, even if I were, I think it's my responsibility -- my moral duty that if I've done well, that I have to make sure that everybody else... KING: Does well too or has a chance? MOORE: Well, has at least a chance but that -- and that the pie is divided fairly amongst the people and not just a few people get the majority of the loot and everybody else has to struggle for the crumbs. KING: Are you saying capitalism is a failure? MOORE: Yes. Capitalism. Yes. Well, I don't have to say it. Capitalism, in the last year, has proven that it's failed. All the basic tenets of what we've talked about the free market, about free enterprise and competition just completely fell apart. As soon as they lost, essentially, our money, they came running to the federal government for a bailout -- for welfare, for socialism. And it -- it -- I thought the basic principle of capitalism was that it's about a -- it's a sink or swim situation. And those who do well, the cream rises to the top and, you know, those who invest their money wrongly or, you know, don't run their business the right way, then they don't do well. And if you run your business the wrong way, where does it say that you or I or anybody watching this has to bail them out? I understand -- I understand why everybody seemed to get behind it, because a lot of people were afraid, because these people down on Wall Street had taken our money and made bets with it. I mean, they essentially created this invisible virtual casino with people's money -- people's pension funds, people's 401(k)s. They took this money and they made bets. And then they made bets on the bets. And then they took out insurance policies on the bets. And then they took out insurance against the insurance -- the credit default swaps. KING: You started... (CROSSTALK) KING: You started filming before Lehman Brothers went belly up. MOORE: Yes. KING: The stock market tanked. Now, how did the events as it occurred affect the movie? MOORE: Well, obviously... KING: Did it change gears? MOORE: It didn't change in terms of what I was looking at, but it did -- it did, obviously, offer probably the best example of why this is a system that is really corrupt at its core -- corrupt because it doesn't, it isn't run with democratic -- small ""d"" democratic principles. There's no democracy in our economy. You and I and the people watching have no say in how this economy is run. The upper 1 percent, the people down on Wall Street, the corporate executives, they're the people that control this economy. KING: And they don't want to see the economy do well? They don't want to see people... MOORE: Oh, they sure do. They want (INAUDIBLE). KING: Don't they want people to make money so they can buy the products? I mean it's silly if they... MOORE: No. KING: They want people unemployed? MOORE: Oddly enough, yes. KING: Why? MOORE: It's crazy, isn't it? I'll tell you why. Because your employees are your biggest success. And, as you've noticed in the last few months, as the unemployment rate has gone up, so has the Dow Jones. Now, you'd think, you know, that Wall Street would respond with oh, my God, unemployment is going up, you know, this is bad for business. But the reality is, is that Wall Street likes that. They like it when companies fire people because immediately the bottom line is going to show a larger profit. KING: Are you saying the investor is more important than the employee? MOORE: Yes. The investor -- and the investor, these days, they want the short-term, quick profit and they want it now. But in the long-term, here's what happened. When I was on this show 20 years ago -- 20 years ago this week, I was here with ""Roger and Me"". KING: I remember. MOORE: And General Motors, that year, made a profit of $4 billion. And yet they had just laid off another 30,000 people. Now, why would you lay people off when you're making a record profit of $4 billion? I mean that was totally insane. But they thought, well, you know, we can make a bigger profit. Maybe we can make $4.2 billion if we move those jobs to Mexico. And so they're always, you know, we can make a little bit more money if we do this. By firing those workers, Larry, they got rid of the very people who buy their cars. KING: The movie opened today in New York and Los Angeles and opens wide next week, right? MOORE: A week from Friday, on October 2nd. KING: The movie is ""Capitalism: A Love Story"". We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KING: Agree or disagree, ""Capitalism: A Love Story"" is one heck of a documentary. We saw it. You should see it -- again, whether you agree or disagree, you should -- you should see it. You talk about legalized greed in connection with what's happened to this economy. Are people hard-wired to be greedy? Is it inert? MOORE: Yes. KING: Are we naturally greedy? MOORE: I think so. I think it's part of our human nature. KING: So if you're greedy, I'm greedy, we're all... MOORE: I think it's -- well, I think it's -- yes, I think it's -- there's this dark side to us as a species -- greed, violence. KING: So how would you weed that out? MOORE: Well, what we've learned to do as a society over hundreds or thousands of years is to create certain structures that sort of keep these bad impulses in check. And up until the late '90s, we had regulations and rules to keep the greed down on Wall Street in check. But starting in the final years of the Clinton administration... KING: And you take them on, too. MOORE: Absolutely. KING: Yes. MOORE: They -- they began cutting away these regulations. And when George W. Bush came in -- there's actually an actual photograph of -- of two of Bush's administrative -- two of the employees in the administration with a chain saw and these hedge clippers cutting the regulations when they finally got rid of all the regulations and the banks and the financial institutions could run wild. So... KING: Do you think they made the inmates run the asylum... MOORE: Yes. KING: They let... MOORE: Yes, I -- yes, absolutely. I mean it -- there was nobody in charge and so they just ran wild with the money. KING: However, your opposition to government bailouts, which you've discussed on this show before, sounds a lot of the stuff that hard core conservatives say. They were opposed to the bailouts. MOORE: Yes. KING: So are you conservative in some aspects? MOORE: Well, I'm conservative, actually, in a lot of aspects of my -- of my life. But... KING: But you were opposed to the bailout. MOORE: Yes. And I... KING: So were they, right? MOORE: Yes. And I think I -- well, then I think that there's common ground that people can find. Now, how I would go about fixing this and how they would go about fixing it, you know, is different, because a lot of them are opposed to the bailout because the bailout was going to protect the teacher's pension fund in California and they don't want to do that so they are against the bailout. And the reason why good Democrats were in favor of the bailout is because there was a -- there was a real fear that what if those pension funds just evaporate? What if we do nothing and then suddenly, all these teachers, all these cops, everybody is -- is out of money? Well, you know what, they got the bailout and people are still out of money. People who lost their 401(k)s or part of their 401(k)s are gone, the -- you showed the clip there where I'm down on Wall Street. And I saw the cops coming up to me there. And I'm thinking oh, you know, they're going to arrest me, I'm -- and I tried to say officers, you know, I'm just doing this for some comedy here. And one of the cops said to me, that's OK, Mike. The guys inside this building, they lost a billion dollars of the New York City police pension fund. You just stay here as long as you want. KING: We've got another clip of ""Capitalism: A Love Story."" It's an explanation of the housing market and the mortgage meltdown. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP FROM ""CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY,"" COURTESY OVERTURE FILMS) MOORE: The scam to swindle people out of the homes they already owned was masterful. Here's how it worked. First, tell these homeowners that they own a bank and that bank is your home. You're sitting on a gold mine. You own your own bank -- the bank of you. And you could use your bank to get more money -- just refinance. Everyone's doing it. Of course, hidden in the dozens or hundreds of pages of fine print are tricky clauses that allow the bank to raise your interest rate to a number you didn't know about, perhaps so high that you won't be able to repay your loan. But that's OK, if you can't repay it, we'll just take your house. (END VIDEO CLIP) KING: Now, you dramatically show foreclosures in this movie. At times, you will cry when you watch it. But does the bank want to do foreclosure? I mean what does a bank want to do with your foreclosed house? It don't make sense. Why would they want to foreclose? MOORE: It's... KING: Why would they make the situation so bad that they foreclose? MOORE: They would prefer that you pay the outrageous interest rates. They would prefer to keep ballooning your -- your payments up and up and -- and take that money from you. But if you can't do it, then suddenly the bank owns property. And, as you know, there's really nothing better to own than property, because it's a... KING: The bank wants to own the house? MOORE: The bank -- the bank, on some level, wants to own the house, because suddenly the bank now owns land. And the more land it can accumulate, the more powerful it is. I know, I mean it's crazy. But it -- these -- these banks set this up. They structured this. And this was -- and the FBI issued this report. They said that 80 percent of this mortgage fraud has been caused by the banks and the lending institutions, not the people taking out a loan. You know, when we -- when the crash first happened we heard how people were taking out these loans, they shouldn't have been buying these houses they couldn't afford and all that. That's a very small piece of this. The vast majority of the fraud was committed by the banks and the financial institutions. And there's no real investigation done by the Justice Department as to who did this, how they did it and why they got away with it. KING: So you're saying crimes occurred here? MOORE: I believe crimes may have occurred here and I think I... KING: But you were making citizen's arrests on Wall Street? MOORE: Well, yes. Right. I'm not convicting them. But you if suspect someone has committed a crime, usually the police will come by and pay you a visit. You know, if they suspected you. I suspect that these crimes have been committed. You know, people's money was taken and -- and used recklessly and lost. Where did it go? What happened to all these mortgages that got chopped up, bundled and shipped to China or wherever else they went? KING: Yes. One of the top news stories this week is health care reform. Of course, Michael's film, ""Sicko,"" focused on house care -- health care, rather. We'll get his take on the president's plan and we'll be back in 60 seconds. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KING: Michael Moore's 2007 film, ""Sicko,"" is credited with helping push health care reform front and center of the political agenda. Here's a little of that Oscar-nominated documentary. You'll remember it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP FROM ""SICKO,"" COURTESY DOG EAT DOG FILMS) MOORE: Yes, there are nearly 50 million Americans with no health insurance. They pray every day they don't get sick, because 18,000 of them will die this year, simply because they're uninsured. And by the end of the week, over 25,000 people have sent me their health care horror stories. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They were investigating whether or not this was a pre-existing condition. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's not medically necessary. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They claim that it's experimental. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We don't consider that life-threatening. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've given the entire health care system over to the insurance industry. MOORE: Eight hundred billion of our tax dollars to the drug and health insurance industry, by letting the drug companies charge whatever they wanted. Here's what it cost to buy these men. And this woman, this guy and this guy and him, too. And the biggest check we'll save for last. And many Americans knew they were never going to see universal health care. And that's why some of them decided to look elsewhere for help. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Which way to Guantanamo Bay? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Detainees representing a threat to our national security are given access to top notch medical facilities. MOORE: Wow! So there was actually one place on American soil that had free universal health care. That's all I needed to know. (END VIDEO CLIP) KING: Lest you think Michael Moore lets Democrats off the hook, wait until you see what's next. Don't go away. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KING: Before you think liberal, conservative, Democrat, Republican, before you see this movie, be open. Michael Moore's movie includes an interview with Robert Feinberg, a former official with Countrywide Financial. He handled what that company termed VIP loans. Senator Dodd financed two mortgages through that VIP program and he gets a rap in this movie. We asked the senator to comment on the allegations of impropriety. His office issued a statement to us today and it says, in part: ""Mr. Feinberg's charges have been repeatedly and definitively discredited by those who've taken the time to look at all the facts. The Republicans and the Democrats of the Senate Ethics Committee, multiple media outlets nationally and in Connecticut that have closely followed the story and independent third parties. There was no sweetheart deal. The Dodds got the same mortgages anyone else could have gotten. Mr. Moore does his reputation for accuracy a considerable disservice by uncritically repeating these false allegations. You may comment. MOORE: I didn't repeat them. Senator Dodd's loan officer at Countrywide, on camera and with the documents present -- we show them right in the film -- these -- these sweetheart loans that the senator got. Now, when I say a sweetheart loan, what I mean is, in the Ethics Committee... (CROSSTALK) MOORE: ...even though they've cleared him, which, of course, what they mean -- when the senators clear each other, they mean to say we don't think he did anything we wouldn't do. So -- but they did stay in their report that it does appear that he got these loans quicker than the average person would have got them and that there may have been some discounts and maybe some things that got waived -- you know, moved -- we don't need this paperwork, we can move this thing along. The question here is, is that Countrywide, which was really known for these subprime loans -- these really kind of crap loans that they gave to people whose credit wasn't very good and charged these high interest rates -- were charging really low. They were really kind of the lowest interest rates anybody could get -- to Senator Dodd. And he would call up Robert Feinberg in person and -- and do these -- get these loans, to get these loans refinanced through him. Now, I think Chris Dodd has been a great senator. I think he's really -- in the presidential debates, he said something I thought was absolutely right on. Most people probably watching this don't know that if you make over $110,000 a year -- those who make over $110,000 a year pay zero Social Security tax on anything over $110,000. So all the rest of Americans pay a flat tax on their entire income, but you and I, Larry, and other people who make over $110,000 a year, we pay zero percent after $110,000. We don't pay a flat 7 percent on all of our salary. KING: Well, are you saying Chris Dodd shouldn't have taken those loans? MOORE: No, no, no. He -- yes, well (INAUDIBLE). I'm just trying to say something, you know, good about the man. KING: You're also very critical... MOORE: But -- yes, but I -- but I think that -- listen, here's -- here's the bottom line. He's the head of the Banking Committee. It's his job to be the watchdog of these banks and these lending institutions. He shouldn't do anything that even has the appearance of favoritism or impropriety. KING: You're also very critical of the secretary of the Treasury. Why? MOORE: Well, I interview one of the top bank regulators from the savings and loan scandal. He's one of the guys who really caught -- caught these guys back in the '80s. And he says on camera, when I ask him, you know, tell me about Tim Geithner, he says, well, here's an individual who essentially has failed. He failed as the head of the New York Fed. It was his job to be the watchdog over what was going on down on Wall Street these last few years. So all of these derivatives, credit default swaps, all this stuff during his term as the head of the New York Fed, the whole thing falls apart under his watch and he's rewarded by being made secretary of the Treasury. It's a classic example of -- as this regulator, Bill Black, says in the film, of -- of how you rise to the top in Washington, DC. KING: You also have a hysterical -- an hysterical time trying to get a definition of derivatives. Do you know what a derivative is now? MOORE: It's a bet. It's essentially a bet. It's -- you're taking a bet out on a stock option and then you can do derivatives off those derivatives. So you can take a bet then out on the bet. KING: What am I betting? MOORE: You're -- you're -- you're betting whether or not that particular stock is going to go a certain way or not. Instead of -- in other words, you're already betting when you buy a share of stock... KING: That's true. Right. MOORE: So you're taking the risk. You're saying I think this company will do well, but that's -- that's my bet. But now -- but then they started creating these crazy schemes. And I -- I go down to the Stock Exchange in the movie and I -- I ask all the traders as they're coming out of work, can anybody explain what a derivative is to me because I'm completely lost here. And then finally one guy says he do it, a guy from Lehman Brothers. And then he can't do it. I mean he tries over and over and over again. KING: So I'm betting that a stock could lose and I could make money by betting on the loss? MOORE: Yes. Yes. KING: So a derivative is a bet that's different from the bet of buying a stock? MOORE: That's correct. Right. Right. And then you can take out credit default insurance. So you can take out insurance on it in case -- just in case your bet is wrong, you can take insurance out on that. KING: It's like insurance at Black Jack. MOORE: Exactly. Right. KING: All right. Michael will be taking your phone calls. Stick around. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL MOORE, PRODUCER: Congressman? Congressman? Governor Bush, it's Michael Moore? GEORGE W. BUSH, FMR. PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Go find real work. MOORE: Hello! I have one question. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right. Motion adjourn. (END VIDEO CLIP) KING: Michael Moore is the guest. The film is ""Capitalism: A Love Story."" He tells me that it opened two places today, New York and Los Angeles, and did three times what ""Slumdog Millionaire"" did, per theater, per capita, on its opening day, and that opened on a Friday. And it doubled ""Sicko,"" right? MOORE: Yes, the studio just told me before I cam in. Apparently the first day has done quite well. KING: Let's take a call for Michael Moore. Tulsa, Oklahoma, hello. CALLER: Hello. I'm 15 years old. I was wondering what you think my generation is going to have to do to come back from these economic times? KING: Good question. MOORE: Yes. First of all, you're owed an apology from my generation. And your children -- your future children are owed an apology. This is -- Larry, we are throwing this debt, this incredible debt, both from the two wars that we're in right now and from the bailout of Wall Street on to this next generation. I would tell you, in terms of just as you think about as you get ready, get close to adulthood, on that first day of college in three years, you're going to see a lot of tables when you go to sign up on the first day. And they're going to be all the credit card companies. And they're going to try to get you to sign up for a credit card, even though you don't have a job. They'll give you a 5,000 dollar credit limit. They're going to get you in hock so deep. Right now, I believe is average is, by the time a student graduates from college, they've got 6,000 dollars of credit card debt, and 20,000, 30,000, 40,000 50,000 dollars -- I know people that have 80,000 dollars of student loan debt. When I went to school, Larry, you didn't go to a private bank to get a loan for 20 years. You went to the financial aid office. And in that office, you got a grant, or a scholarship, or work study. Maybe you had to work at the library ten hours a week. Or maybe there was a low-interest loan for one or two percent from the college. You pay it back when you can. That's the way it was. If you lived in New York or California, at many of the colleges, you went to school for free. Now this young man, what he has ahead of him is if is going to have to -- if he has to get a student loan, for instance, for four years of college, 20,000 dollars a year, 80,000 dollars, that means that by the time he actually pays it off in 20 to 30 years, he will have paid that bank at least a half a million dollars just to go to school. You know, we improve our society by having our children go to school and better themselves. That's how the society grows. That's how we make things better. KING: Hopefully. MOORE: But -- so I would just encourage you to, you know, watch your money. There's lots of hands that want to get in your wallet. And be conservative with it. KING: You are very rough on Goldman Sachs, concluding they run the country almost. Both administrations. You backed Obama. He supported bail outs. He took a lot of campaign contributions from Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs employees work for him. Do you feel let down? MOORE: No, I think he's part of the system. It's a broke system. It's a system where money calls the shots. We have to get money out of our political system. We need publicly financed elections. We need the candidates to be given air time. But that's it. We got to do this like the other western countries do it. They don't allow this kind of money inside of their politics. You're right, President Obama, Goldman Sachs employees were his number one private contributors. I say that in the film, even though I support the man, and I'm wishing him the best, and I'm all behind him. But I think the people have the right to know that he, too, took this money. And now we're waiting to see whether or not he's going to be on our side or on Wall Street's side. KING: Is he going to get health care reform? MOORE: Well, I certainly hope so; 75 percent of the American people are expecting it. That's what the polls show. The majority of this country voted for him in large part because they want universal health care. The majority actually want single-payer health care. So we're so far away from that right now. President Obama's, I think, problem or mistake here is that he started out with a compromise position with this public option. He should have started with what he said in 2003, when he was first thinking of running for the U.S. Senate, when he said he supported a single-payer system. Start with that. If you have to compromise, fine, that's the art of politics. But to start with a compromised position -- He had his base, nobody out there backing him up. You didn't see millions of people out there supporting him. But you did see people on the other side being very vocal. They ruled the day with it. KING: One extraordinary thing in this movie, and you'll flip when you see it, is Michael Moore discovered an old film done by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, shortly before he died, about a new Bill of Rights. We'll ask about it when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was kind of a strange child. My parents knew earlier on that something must have been wrong with me. I crawled backwards until I was two. But I had Kennedy's Inaugural Address memorized by the time I was six. It all began when my mother didn't show up for my first birthday party because she was off having my sister. My dad tried to cheer me up by letting me eat the whole cake. I knew then there had to be more to life than this. (END VIDEO CLIP) MOORE: Cake was a bad idea. KING: Beautiful. My kid crawled backwards. Never crawled forwards, not until he was two. MOORE: I'm so glad to hear that. All my life, I've been thinking, what was wrong with me? KING: Chance crawled backwards. Now he's an all-star little league ballplayer. MOORE: That didn't happen to me. KING: There's hope for you. Before we take another call, tell me about this extraordinary Roosevelt film that we see near the end of your movie. A never before seen film. MOORE: Just a little over a year before he died, he had the flu. He was sick. He knew he was near death. He was in the White House. And he wanted to tell the American people what he would like to see the United States be after the war would end and after his death. So he proposed a second Bill of Rights to the U.S. Constitution. And that bill of rights was to guarantee Americans a decent job, universal health care, a pension in their old age, the right to have a decent home, all of these -- the basics. KING: That was a socialist in concept, to guarantee that? MOORE: Well, I think what it was, it was the humane thing to do. It was -- he wasn't promising a home for everyone. But he was saying that we had a right to have a home. KING: It would shock people. Why was it never seen? MOORE: And no one ever saw this. He called these news reel cameras in. He wanted to film this one piece. KING: What happened to it? MOORE: Nobody knows. It was lost. KING: Where did you find it? MOORE: My great team of archivists found it at the University of South Carolina. They had some old Fox movie tone news reels. KING: Was it ironic? MOORE: It was not marked as anything other than the just a date on it. They went through it and they found it. And I am so honored to have this in my film, because the American people, Larry, next week, starting today, here in New York, are going to be able to see this for the first time, the way Roosevelt had hoped they would be able to see this. KING: Let's take a call. Richmond, Ohio. Hello. CALLER: Hello. Hi, Larry. Hi, Michael. MOORE: Hi. CALLER: Hey, I've got an issue. And I'm just wondering, you know, what Michael might think of it. Would Michael be willing to file a class action suit or some type of petition that all of us could jump on the way the federal government is double-dipping, basically, like Congress and such. They take money from special interest groups and they're not doing the government by the people, for the people. MOORE: You know, I don't think we need to sue anybody. I think we need to start electing people who have, at the top of their platform, the removal of money from our political system. I want to hear candidates -- that's right, I want to hear candidates next year say that we should have, like all other western democracies, a form of publicly financed elections. Shorten the election season. Provide free time over the airwaves for the candidates. This would greatly reduce the attack ads. Of course, it would also reduce the income of CNN, but that's a separate story. But this is crazy the way we do this now, because right now, for instance, on this health care thing, Larry, the health care industry is spending 1.4 million dollars a day on lobbyists, lobbying against universal health care. A day they're spending this. How does this guy calling in, or you or I or anybody out there have a snowball's chance to have our voices heard? I mean, how else you can explain the fact that 75 percent of this country wants universal health care, and yet, we can't get it? Because we done have the money to give to these Congressmen. KING: Get a break and come back. Michael Moore has been a moviemaker for 20 years now. We'll take a look at the film that started it all in 60 seconds. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KING: We're back with Michael Moore. ""Capitalism: A Love Story"" is being released on the 20th anniversary of ""Roger and Me,"" the documentary about GM that made Michael Moore famous, or notorious, depending on your point of view. Trouble in the auto industry, massive economic fallout. Sound familiar? Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOORE: So this was GM Chairman, Roger Smith. He appeared to have a brilliant plan. First, close 11 factories in the U.S. Then open 11 in Mexico, where you pay the workers 70 cents an hour. Then use the money you save by building cars in Mexico to take over other companies, preferably high-tech firms and weapons manufacturers. Next, tell the union you're broke. And they happily agree to give back a couple billion dollars in wage cuts. You then take that money from the workers and eliminate their jobs by building more foreign factories. Roger Smith was a true genius. DAN RATHER, FMR CBS NEWS ANCHOR: General Motors confirmed it today. It is going to close plants employing almost 30,000 workers. ROGER SMITH, FMR. CHAIRMAN, GM: Today, we are announcing the closing of 11 of our older plants. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: While Detroit and Pontiac will certainly be hurt by the shutdowns, the effect on Flint is absolutely devastating. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Best thing they can do and General Motors can do is get rid of Roger Smith and them other son of a bitches. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm sick and tired of these damn fat cats. MOORE: As soon as I could, I headed down to Detroit to Roger's office. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you have an appointment? MOORE: No, we're going to try to see Roger Smith. Mr. Smith, we just came down from Flint, where we filmed a family being evicted from their home the day before Christmas eve, a family that used to work in the factory. Would you be willing to come up with us, to see what the situation is like in Flint? SMITH: I've been to Flint. I'm sorry for those people. I don't know anything about it. MOORE: Maybe I got this wrong. I thought companies lay off people when they've hit hard times. GM was the richest company in the world. It was closing factories when it was making profits in the billions. (END VIDEO CLIP) KING: What can you add to that? We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (NEWS BREAK) KING: The young film makers who triggered a firestorm against Acorn, they did undercover videos. Was that OK by your standards? MOORE: I haven't seen the videos. KING: Acorn has now filed a suit against them in connection with hidden camera videos shot in their Baltimore office. Acorn contending the audio portion was illegally obtained, because Maryland law requires a two-party consent for sound recordings. Do you do a lot of undercover? MOORE: No, I don't. Actually, I -- my rule is that we don't do hidden camera. No, in very few exceptions in these 20 years have I done that, because I think it's better to have the camera right there present. I think, actually, the camera becomes a character in the scene because people realize they're being filmed. And they're going to say or do something as a result of that. KING: What do you make of the tea party protests? MOORE: I think everybody has a right to get involved. Of course, I don't know how much that's being funded by certain interests associated with the health care industry. But nonetheless, these are people standing up for what they believe in. And liberals should quit complaining about that and say hey, we're the majority. Where are we? Why aren't we going to the town hall meetings? Why aren't we standing up for these things? KING: What do you think of President Carter's claim about racism being the underlying factor here? MOORE: Well, I think President Carter, having grown up in the segregated south, knows it when he sees it. And it was a courageous thing I think for him to say. I think that's a part of it. I think that's there. You would have to be crazy not to know that it's there. And I give him a lot of credit for stating what I think a lot of people were thinking but nobody wants to say. KING: We have a question Tweeted via Kings Things, please ask Mr. Moore to disclose his income and what he does to give back or pay it forward. MOORE: Well, I do a lot of things. My wife and I just helped to pay for redoing the addition to the library in the town which we live in Michigan. We just bought a huge piece of land to give to the Land Conservatory to protect it for environmental reasons. We do a lot of things. And I treat my employees quite well. They're paid really good wages. They have full health care and dental. My employees, there's no deductible in your health care. No deductible, absolutely not. You get paid sick days, as many as you need, personal days. KING: Vacation in the south of France? I'm just asking. MOORE: No. KING: What do you spend money on wildly, go to Vegas? MOORE: No, I'm on iTunes too much, buying too many songs. KING: Do you buy cars? MOORE: No, I have one car. It's a Chrysler minivan, about five years old, got about 100,000 miles on it. I do have a little fishing boat in Michigan. We have lots of lakes. KING: Money in Switzerland? MOORE: No money in Switzerland. I don't own a share of stock. I have no money in the stock market. My money is in pretty much a savings account and savings bonds, those kinds of things. But -- KING: Another question Tweeted via Kings Things, gun control, health care, the war and now the economy. OK, you've done that. When is Michael Moore going to make a movie about climate change? MOORE: Well, I think that movie's been made. Thank you, Al Gore. And other movies have been made since then. The topic is out there. And I think I need to, perhaps, you know, focus my attention on the things not receiving much attention. KING: And you will now get a thrill when we come back. Michael Moore, the singer. You don't want to miss this. MOORE: Don't make me sing here. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOORE: Members of Congress, this is Michael Moore. I would like to read to you the U.S. Patriot Act. I want the account where I can get the free gun. There's wackos out there. Of course, I was having a hard time finding my business card because I don't have any business cards. So I give Mr. Slaughter my discount pass at Chuck-E-Cheese. Sweet. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Good shot. (END VIDEO CLIP) KING: Our crack undercover team found out where you spend your money. Clothes. You are the dapper man of the year. You were runner-up for British GQ man of the year. Right? MOORE: A few years ago, that was actually true. Of course, the Brits have a great sense of humor. KING: Obviously. You were a guest on Jay Leno's show last week and you sang. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAY LENO, ""THE JAY LENO SHOW"": Ladies and gentlemen, the song stylings of Michael Moore. (SINGING) (END VIDEO CLIP) KING: You're an Irish tenor. That's a nice voice. You can sing. MOORE: Well, yes, I guess. KING: Did you write that? MOORE: No. You know, he has this new thing on the show where if they're going to show a clip from your movie, you got to sing a song or do something. So I agreed and did one Bob Dylan song. Thank you for that. KING: Bob Dylan wrote that. I thought you wrote it. See where I am. MOORE: No, but that's OK, though. It's kind of an obscure song from the '60s. KING: I gather. If it's obscure, you'll find it. Another call for Michael Moore. Hello. CALLER: Hi, Larry. Hi, Michael. Mike, I think you're talking about corruption and greed. What does capitalism have to do with it? MOORE: Capitalism is the legal system that allows this greed to take place. And in recent times, what it means is that the regulations and the rules that used to keep these people in check no longer is keeping them in check. So, you know, I don't believe in a system where the richest one percent should own or have as much financial wealth as the bottom 95 percent combined. I think that not only is that anti-democracy, it's also against my own personal values and the values of most people. We say we live in a Judeo-Christian nation, but I don't think if Jesus were around today -- I just don't think he'd be approving of this or participating in a hedge fund or playing the stock market. KING: He's even in your movie. MOORE: Yes, he has a role in my movie, because I imagined what if he were here, would he act and sound like a capitalist? KING: You end the movie by saying capitalism must be replaced by a new system. And we pause and I thought you were going to say something else. You said democracy. MOORE: Yes, that's correct. We need to have control of our economy. I don't understand how we can call this a democracy, just because we get to vote every two to four years. Somehow I guess that's the democracy. But yet in our economy, there's no real democracy in the workplace. There's no democracy. I mean, I want to live in a real democracy, where I don't lose my democratic rights when I go to work every morning, or when I go to the bank to cash my check. I think that if we would restructure -- here's what I want to say. KING: Quickly. MOORE: Yes. Let's quit having this debate of capitalism versus socialism. It's the 21st century. We are smart enough to come up with a new economic order that is fair, fair to all people, where we don't have so many people hurting. Right now, there's a foreclosure filing in America once every seven and a half seconds. That is absolutely outrageous. And it's time to start sticking up for the little guy in this country. KING: Click in with CNN all day tomorrow. We're going to have a special guest you might be interested in. Check with us all day tomorrow. Right now -- Thanks again, Michael. MOORE: Thanks. Next time I'll sing with you. KING: It's that time of night. (SINGING) KING: It's that time of night. Here's Anderson Cooper with ""AC 360."" Anderson?"

Rick Perry’s years-ago switch from the Democratic to the Republican party Puts him in the same company as the nation’s 40th president.""You’re sort of like Ronald Reagan, you feel the Democratic Party left you?"" Hannity asked.Perry replied that he’d had a conversation with Reagan’s son Michael, a political consultant and former radio host. ""I told Michael Reagan the other day … ‘You know, I love your dad, and he was part of the reason I became a Republican,’ but I said, ‘I became a Republican sooner in my life than your dad did.’ ""Perry and Hannity shared a laugh over that. But that light moment left unresolved how old each leader was when he made his D-to-R leap. Did Perry beat Reagan to the flip point?We’ll take a look at Reagan first. In March 2010, PolitiFact Florida rated True the claim that ""Reagan was a Democrat before he was a Republican.""Historian Edward Yager, author of the 2006 biography Ronald Reagan’s Journey: Democrat to Republican, told PolitiFact Florida that Reagan, who was born Feb. 6, 1911, ""was registered Democrat from the time that he voted for (Democrat Franklin Roosevelt) in 1932, when he was 21.""Yager said that he hadn’t seen copies of Reagan’s voter registration cards but that ""virtually all the sources that refer to"" Reagan’s party affiliation indicate that he was registered as a Democrat. Yager also noted that Reagan ""has two autobiographies in which he refers to his voting for (Roosevelt) four times"" and then for President Harry Truman, a Democrat, in 1948.Later, while still a Democrat, Reagan began supporting Republican presidential candidates. Melissa Giller, director of communications and programs at Reagan’s presidential library, told PolitiFact Florida that Reagan endorsed the presidential candidacies of Republican Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 — at ages 41 and 45, respectively — and Republican Richard Nixon in 1960 ""while remaining a Democrat.""Perry and other Republican presidential candidates are scheduled to debate at the Reagan library, in Simi Valley, Calif., on Sept. 7.The library’s website says Reagan registered as a Republican in the fall of 1962, when he was 51. According to the site, a woman interrupted Reagan while he was speaking in favor of Nixon’s unsuccessful gubernatorial bid in California to ask him whether he had yet to register as a Republican. ""When he said, ‘Well, no, I haven’t yet, but I intend to,’ down the center aisle through the audience came a woman who declared, ‘I’m a registrar,’ and placed a registration card in front of him,"" the site says. ""In front of his audience, Ronald Reagan officially joined the Republican Party.""In her 2010 email to PolitiFact Florida, Giller pointed to the famous Reagan quip that Hannity echoed on his show: ""I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The party left me.''Other studies of Reagan also trace his party switch to 1962, including Yager’s book and a 1982 Reagan biography by Lou Cannon, which says Reagan ""was an active Democrat"" in 1952, when he married Nancy Davis, ""and would remain a registered Democrat for another decade.""In 1962, Cannon writes, when Reagan was approached by California Republicans to help campaign on their behalf, he told them that he ""didn’t want to be a professional Democrat campaigning for the Republicans"" and would re-register as a Republican. ""He did so, at a subsequent political meeting where he spoke on behalf of the ill-fated Nixon campaign against Governor Edmund G. (Pat) Brown,"" Cannon writes.So, by several accounts, Reagan was 51 when he became a Republican, although he began backing GOP presidential candidates a decade earlier.How old was Perry, born March 4, 1950, when he made his move?We’ve looked at Perry’s political past in previous fact-checks , reporting that Perry won his first election as a Democrat, taking a West Texas House district seat in 1984, when Democrats controlled the Legislature and the state had had just one Republican governor since Reconstruction. He won re-election in 1986 and 1988 before switching parties in 1989 to challenge Democratic Agricultural Commissioner Jim Hightower in 1990 — a race that Perry won in an upset.The biography on Perry’s presidential campaign website agrees with that account.A July 14 Texas Tribune story says that during his years in the Texas House, Perry was far from liberal. ""Perry, a young rancher and cotton farmer, gained an early reputation as a fiscal conservative,"" the story says. ""He was one of a handful of freshman ‘pit bulls,’ so named because they sat in the lower pit of the House Appropriations Committee, where they fought to keep spending low.""The Tribune story says Perry announced he was changing parties on Sept. 29, 1989, during a press conference outside the Texas Capitol. ""I intend to vote the same convictions,"" Perry said then, according to the Tribune. ""The only difference is there will be an ‘R’ beside my name.""On the day of the press conference, Perry was 39 years old.We rate his statement as True.Advertisement"

He has also been offered a top post in the new White House Office of Health Reform, twin duties that could make him the most influential surgeon general in history.A practicing physician and one of People magazine's ""Sexiest Men Alive,"" Gupta met for more than two hours with Obama in Chicago on Nov. 25, according to two sources with knowledge of the talks. Gupta, 39, later spoke with several Obama advisers, including Thomas A. Daschle, who will run the new White House policy office and the Department of Health and Human Services.The globetrotting doctor has told Obama aides he wants the job, which involves overseeing the 6,000-member Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service. When reached yesterday, Gupta did not deny that he plans to accept the offer but declined to comment.Transition officials refused to speak on the record about his selection, but several Obama allies praised Gupta as the sort of highly visible, articulate physician who might restore the luster that the position of ""the nation's doctor"" had in the person of Reagan appointee C. Everett Koop and some of his predecessors.A representative of the Commissioned Corps, however, said Gupta will face a ""credibility gap"" because he has never served in the uniformed Public Health Service.""I am unaware of any public health experience or qualifications he has to be the leader of the nation's public health service,"" said Gerard M. Farrell, executive director of the service's Commissioned Officers Association. ""This would be akin to appointing the Army chief of staff from the city council of Hoboken,"" N.J.The selection of Gupta represents a ""return to a communicator model,"" said Susan Blumenthal, who retired as an assistant surgeon general two years ago after 20 years in the Public Health Service.If he is confirmed by the Senate, Gupta would provide the administration with a skilled television personality to help market what is planned to be a massive reorganization of the U.S. health system.The Obama team already has initiated a public relations campaign aimed at mobilizing grass-roots support for eventual health reform legislation. Last week, Daschle appeared at town-hall-style meetings in Indiana and Washington to solicit public input. The sessions, captured on video and posted on the transition Web site, were among more than 8,500 local gatherings held over the holidays.Gupta is ""a great voice to get the public engaged in the discussion over health care reform,"" said Kenneth Thorpe, a former Clinton administration official who has become friendly with Gupta as a colleague at Emory University in Atlanta.Gupta, the son of Indian parents, has long been drawn to policymaking. He was a White House fellow in the late 1990s, writing speeches and crafting policy for then-first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton . He is currently associate chief of neurosurgery at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta's busy downtown hospital.CONTINUED 1 "

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.CHRIS WALLACE, ANCHOR: I'm Chris Wallace.With our nation's military fighting multiple wars while facing budget cuts, there's a change coming at the top.(MUSIC)WALLACE: As the secretary of defense nears his final salute to the troops, we'll ask him about Afghanistan and Libya, whether Pakistan can be trusted. And working for two very different presidents. It's a special exit interview with Defense Secretary Robert Gates.Then, I have been waiting months for this one.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEWART: I come on ""Fox News Sunday"", be hard on me, unless I'm announcing I'm running for president.(LAUGHTER)WALLACE: Candidate or not. We'll grill the bad boy of political comedy about liberal media bias, Fox News, and what he really thinks of President Obama. Jon Stewart in his first appearance on a Sunday talk show.Also, the president and congressional Democrats pick apart the GOP budget without coming up with one of their own. We'll ask our Sunday group whether playing the waiting game is paying off.All right now on ""Fox News Sunday.""And hello again from Fox News in Washington.We have political odd couple this week. We'll talk with comedian Jon Stewart a little later. But, first, we're honored to sit down wit Defense Secretary Robert Gates, just days before he leaves office -- having serve Presidents Bush and Obama in his demanding job.Mr. Secretary, welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday.""DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT GATES: Thank you.WALLACE: Today marks the 90th day of U.S. involvement in Libya. Congressional critics say that s that the administration is now officially in violation of the War Powers Act. If Congress cuts off funding, pulls us out of Libya, what do you think are the consequences for U.S. national security and our standing in the world?GATES: Well, we've been through this on a number of occasions, even since I've secretary, where Congress has threatened to cut off funding in Iraq and on several occasions and so on. Frankly, I think cutting off funding in the middle of a military operation when we have people engaged is always a mistake.By the same token, I would say that, you know, I was in the White House and the NSC staff not long after the War Powers Act was passed. And I believe that President Obama has complied with the law, consistent in a manner with virtually all of his predecessors. I don't think he's breaking any new ground here.WALLACE: And so, therefore, you don't think he's in violence of the War Powers Act?GATES: No. And I think -- but I think he's been clear as well, that he would welcome the Congress passing a resolution of support.WALLACE: Secretary Gates, is the U.S. involved in the hostilities in Libya?GATES: The way I like to put it is from our standpoint at the Pentagon, we're involved in a limited kinetic operation. If I'm in Qaddafi's palace, I suspect I think I'm at war.WALLACE: President -- the reason I'm asking, of course, is that President Obama, and you kind of duck the question very ably I must say. President Obama told Congress this week that the War Powers Act does not apply to what's going on in Libya.The official White House report to Congress said this -- ""U.S. military operations are distinct from the kind of hostilities contemplated by the War Powers Act."" And the president reportedly rejected the legal opinion of the Pentagon's general counsel, Jay Johnson, as well as the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel.Question: are you comfortable with that?GATES: I think that the president is in a position to take the advice of variety of people. And also on legal, as other matters, that he has the opportunity to make his own decisions. I think that -- in fact, I'm confident that he would not make judgment along these lines if he were not confident that he was acting a constitutional manner.WALLACE: Well, I understand that you're saying that he's confident and comfortable with the fact that he is operating a constitutional manner. But, you know, to someone who sees we're spending, what, $10 million a day, we have drones bombing Libya, we have surveillance, we have intel -- how is that not hostilities?GATES: Well, I'm going to defer to the White House and to the president on the legal interpretations.WALLACE: You said that getting involved in Libya in the first place was the only major disagreement that you have had with this president. Do you agree with the current strategy of letting NATO take the lead of as it's being called the strategy of leading from behind? Is that a strategy for success?GATES: I think it's absolutely the right strategy. When this operation started, the president, we were at war in Iraq, still. We had 50,000 troops in Iraq. We had 100,000 troops in Afghanistan. We had 24,000 people engaged in Japanese earthquake relief. We have a number of commitments around the world.And so, the arrangement and the understanding the president had with our key allies from the very beginning was the U.S. would come in heavy at beginning, establish a no-fly zone and then hand off the operation to our allies and that we would recede into a support role. That was his decision going in and he stuck to it.WALLACE: But can this work? Can this get Qaddafi out of power?GATES: Yes, I think -- actually, I think it can in over time. I think --WALLACE: Time, meaning?GATES: -- talking to various people, the chairman and others, I think we all sense that the Qaddafi regime is getting weaker by the day. Their military forces are being attritted every.So, I think it is a matter of time. I do know -- I can't make a prediction how long it will take. But they clearly are getting significantly weaker as this effort goes along.WALLACE: President Obama is now deciding how many troops to pull out of Afghanistan as part of the July drawdown that he announced back in December of 2009, when he announced the troop surge.The Wall Street Journal reports that the military wants to keep -- the majority, the vast majority of the 33,000 surge forces there, to the fall of 2012, through two more fighting seasons. Is that true?GATES: Well, first of all, fall of 2012 would be one more fighting season after this one. And --WALLACE: Well, right. We're in the middle of one right now.GATES: And the truth is, our obligation is to present the president with a range of options, and the risk attendant to each of those options, and then for the commander-in-chief to make a decision. And he will do that, and, frankly, I don't want to get into further in the process than that.WALLACE: Well, let me ask you this. And I understand you don't want to get ahead of the president. You're calling for a modest drawdown. Mr. Obama keeps talking about a significant drawdown. Have you told the president -- without getting into numbers -- anything over a specific number jeopardizes the gains that we have made in Afghanistan?GATES: I'm absolutely not going to go down the road of what I tell the president.WALLACE: Let me ask it a different way. You look at me like I only have 11 more days and I don't have to put up with these guys anymore. How confident are you that given the renewed debate within the administration about the way forward in Afghanistan, counterinsurgency versus counterterrorism, how confident are you that the president won't pull enough troops out Afghanistan to jeopardize the gains that we have made there?GATES: I think that the president has a good strategy. He decided on that strategy in December of 2009. It's always been envisioned that with success on the ground, that the balance between combination of counterinsurgency and counterterrorism, the way it would shift more to counterterrorism over time. We have had a lot of success over the last 15 months in Afghanistan. The conditions on the ground are far better than they were a year ago.So far in this fighting season, we have not only held on to everything we took from the Taliban last year, have been able to expand security, further and further disrupt the infiltrations coming in from Pakistan.So, I would say that whatever decision the president makes, it's going to be a decision that is based on the gains that we e laid on the ground, success on the ground.WALLACE: And that he won't jeopardize those gains.GATES: I don't think so.WALLACE: During the Republican debate last week, several candidates talked about in effect heading for the exits in Afghanistan and in Libya. Mitt Romney called for getting our troops out of Afghanistan as quickly as possible. Let's watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Our troops shouldn't go off and try and fight a war of independence for another nation. Only the Afghanis can win Afghanistan's independence from the Taliban.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: And Jon Huntsman talks about reducing U.S. forces in Afghanistan to 15,000. He said this: ""The very expensive boots on the ground may be something that is not critical for our national security needs, nor is it something we can afford at this point in our economic history.""Question: do you worry about growing isolationism in the Republican Party?GATES: I worry that people whose primary worry and concern is the economy and the deficit will see defense and our engagement around the world as a way to reduce those obligations and that deficit. I believe that -- I believe that misunderstands -- misstates the problem.GATES: The base defense budget is not part of the deficit problem. Our percentage of the base budget, not counting the cost of wars, the defense budget is about 3-1/2 percent of GDP. That's basically the lowest that's been, except for a brief period in the '90s since before World War II.We know we have to be a part of the savings. The cost of these wars is coming down dramatically, between fiscal year '11 and '12, go down $40 billion, between '12 and '13, it will probably go down several billion more.So, I think that it's a mistake -- particularly to couch the question in terms of the cost of war, because my question is, what's the cost of failure? What was cost of 9/11 because we left Afghanistan in 1989? How much money have we spent since 9/11 trying to deal with that problem?We are on the right road. We know we are going to end our combat role there by the end of 2014, our role, the kind of role we have now. So, this isn't an open-ended conflict. I just ask people to consider the consequences of failure.And, by the way, my recollection is that Mr. Romney also went on to say that the withdrawal should also be based on the recommendations of the commanders in the field.WALLACE: He did, however, and you're hearing this from Bachmann and you're hearing it from Huntsman, there does seem to be something of a rush for the exits. And it does seem to be a war of weariness. It's not just budget.GATES: Of course, there's war weariness. This country has been engaged in two wars everyday in the four and a half years I've been secretary of defense. So, I fully appreciate that. Believe me, there's nobody more war-weary that our at this point.But the preside responsibility -- and I have seen this in his predecessors -- his responsibility is look out the long-term national security interest of the United States. He has to have a longer view.And frankly, other than the first couple of years of World War II, there has never been popular war in American history.WALLACE: I want go to, quickly -- I know you don't like lightning rounds, so I'm not going to call it that. But I want to go quickly over some hot spots with you. First of all, Pakistan. Five informants who helped us capture, find or identify Osama bin Laden have reportedly been arrested. The head of the Pakistani army is under fire for being too pro-American. How close are we to a breach in relations with Pakistan?GATES: Well, I think -- I think I don't know the answer to that. I know that we need other. And each side recognizes that. Our relationship has been a complex one for decades. And the way I put it is we just have to keep working at it.WALLACE: There's been a spike in violence recently in Iraq. CIA director and secretary of defense nominee, designate, Leon Panetta, says there are a thousand al Qaeda in Iraq. All U.S. forces are supposed to be out of country by the end of the year. Would you like to see some of them stay?GATES: Well, I think that there is an interest. And I believe that it's in our mutual interest to have some limited number of U.S. forces to remain and training and equipping and a doing counterterrorism.WALLACE: Beyond the end of 2011?GATES: Beyond the end of 2011. But at the same time, you know, although there are a number of al Qaeda -- al Qaeda in Iraq for the most part has been targeting Iraqis. This has been their practice. It's one of the reasons why they lost and why they suffered such grievous losses because the Iraqis got fed up with it.Actually, more concern and the direct threat to our troops is more extremists Shia groups that are sponsored or have an affiliation with Sadr. And so, these are the groups right now that constitute the biggest threat to our troops and our troops that have been killed over the past several weeks for the most part are being attacked by this affiliate --WALLACE: We have, what, about 40,000 troops there now?GATES: About 47,000.WALLACE: How many would you like to see stay into 2012?GATES: Well, I think that's a matter for the Iraqis, first of all, to tell us what they would like for us to do and to have a dialogue. And I think we're beginning that dialogue. And until we figure out what the mission, then it's hard to figure out how many people you'd have there. But it I would be a fraction of what we have now.WALLACE: As you leave office, how much of a disappointment is it to you that Iran still an active nuclear weapons program?GATES: Well, I think it's an ongoing problem for the world, not just for the United States. I think that Iran with a nuclear weapon is extremely destabilizing. I think it could precipitate a nuclear arms race in the region. I think we haven't thought through all of the consequences -- or we haven't talked enough about the consequences of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons.So, I think our position that we can't accept that as outcome is the right position. And my hope is that we can, you know, as the president has -- his predecessor said, all options are on the table.But my hope is that we can find a peaceful way to persuade these guys. This is in their interest.WALLACE: Finally, I want to get some big picture reflections from you. I was looking at your record -- 45 years on and off in government service, eight presidents.What's your big take-away as you leave Washington? What's the big lesson?GATES: That when we have been successful in national security and foreign affairs, it has been because there has been bipartisan support. And agreement between the president and the Congress that the fundamental strategy -- maybe not all the tactics, maybe not al the specific decisions -- but that the fundamental strategy is the correct one. That's what happen through nine presidencies and the Cold War that led to our success, because no major international problem can be solved on one president's watch.And so, unless it has bipartisan support, unless it can be extended over a period of time, the risks of failure is high.WALLACE: When you look ahead to the future, what do you worry about?GATES: A loss of bipartisanship.WALLACE: And with the hyper-partisanship this town on a lot of other issues, do you see that bleeding into foreign policy, national security?GATES: I do.WALLACE: Any thoughts about what can be done?GATES: Well, I think that there some -- I think that -- I'm not sure what can be done quite frankly. I've tried to what I could in terms of a civilized dialogue, of a civil dialogue between the executive branch and the Congress under both President Bush and President Obama.And I think that the kind of relationships that I've had on the Hill show that when individuals make this effort, they can make headway. They can make progress, and at least having civil conversation about these issues.WALLACE: I want to -- you'll hate this -- go through some association with you. I want you to give me a word, a phrase, thumbnail sketch for some of the presidents that you served in top jobs.Reagan.GATES: A great preside. I think vastly underestimated terms of how good he was and how important has.WALLACE: Bush 41.GATES: I think that the fact that the Cold War -- 1991 was the first time in history that a heavily armed great power collapsed without a war. Some day, Bush will get the credit he deserves for helping bring that about.WALLACE: Bush 43.GATES: Decisive. A man of strong beliefs.WALLACE: And Obama?GATES: Analytical and decisive.WALLACE: Finally, I want to talk about the troops. You say that you think of them as your own sons and daughters. You signed the papers that send them in to war. You say when you sign -- send letters of condolence, that you like to get a packet with information about them, with a picture of them, so when you write to their loved ones, you know.What has it meant to you to serve with our remarkable fighting men and women?GATES: By the way, I would put it as -- there are many aspects to this job. The only thing that I'll miss is the people I worked with and above all, the opportunity to interact with the troops. I just spent three days with them in Afghanistan. Week-and-a-half ago, and getting on that plane was very hard.WALLACE: Because?GATES: Leaving them behind, and still in the fight. And just -- they're so dedicated and so confident and they're so capable. They're just so extraordinary people.WALLACE: Secretary Gates, we want to thank you. We want to thank you for coming in and giving us one last interview as secretary of defense. And we want to thank you -- and I know I speak for everyone -- for your service to our country, sir.GATES: Thank you.WALLACE: Up next, Jon Stewart, the host of ""The Daily Show"" -- this time, I get to grill him.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: It was last November when Jon Stewart promised on his show he would come here and answer my questions. After months of evasion, disconnected phone numbers, and press agents saying, ""Who are you again?"" -- it appears he finally ran out of excuses.And so, Jon Stewart, welcome to ""Fox News Sunday.""STEWART: Thank you so much, Chris. I really -- I appreciate it. I just want to say, as a viewer, I can't tell you how disappointed I am that you would sully a program of this integrity, of this quality, with the presence such as Jon Stewart.WALLACE: No. Have you checked out the mugs?STEWART: Yes. They're very nice. They're very --WALLACE: You can see what it says on the inside of the mugs?STEWART: Can I read it out loud? It's somewhat anti-Semitic. Do you want me to read it?WALLACE: ""Fair and balanced.""WALLACE: Yes.STEWART: Yes. I like to --WALLACE: How about -- how about we toast and we both take a big drink out of our mugs?STEWART: I'd be -- you know, it's interesting that the mug itself --WALLACE: No, no. No talking. Just drink it. Just drink the water.STEWART: Why do you want me to drink it?WALLACE: Just, please.STEWART: It's just interesting that you want me to drink it. Why don't you have a taste of this first? WALLACE: I'm drinking it myself.STEWART: Yes. But we could have different waters. I've seen --WALLACE: Are you scared of this?STEWART: All right.And while you're drinking -- you love to take shots at FOX News.STEWART: Yes, I did.WALLACE: Over the years, you have called us -- and we're going to put this on the screen because this is heavy stuff.STEWART: Please.WALLACE: ""A biased organization, relentlessly promoting an ideological agenda under the rubric of being a news organization.""STEWART: Rubric.WALLACE: And -- I actually think that's slightly the wrong use for the word rubric.""A relentless agenda-driven, 24-hour news opinion propaganda delivery system.""STEWART: Yes.WALLACE: Where do you come up with this stuff?STEWART: It's actually quite easy when you feel it. You got to feel it in your soul, you know?WALLACE: Well, here's the deal. Are you willing to say the same thing about the mainstream media, about ABC, CBS, NBC, ""Washington Post,"" ""New York Times""?STEWART: No.WALLACE: Would you say the same thing about them that they are -- in your words -- a propaganda delivery system relentlessly pushing a liberal agenda?STEWART: No, I wouldn't say that.WALLACE: Why not?STEWART: MSNBC is attempting that. I think they're attempting. They've looked at your business model and they have seen the success of it. And I think they're attempting to be a more activist organization.WALLACE: You don't think ""The New York Times"" is a liberal organization?STEWART: No.WALLACE: Pushing a liberal agenda?STEWART: ""The New York Times,"" no. I think they are to a certain extent. Do I think they're relentlessly activist? No. In a purely liberal partisan way? No, I don't.I think is this -- FOX is a very special --WALLACE: The shutters to go from your eyes because I'm going to prove it to you in the next few minutes.STEWART: Oh, OK. I don't -- I'm excited about that.WALLACE: Here we go.STEWART: Can I tell you this? I love to learn!WALLACE: Even you make fun of the fact that ""The New York Times"" and the ""Washington Post"" when this document dump of 24,000 e-mails of Sarah Palin was released, and they got so excited about it, they asked their readers, help us. Go through these 24,00 documents?STEWART: Right.WALLACE: How do you explain the fact that they would do that? Would ask the readers to help them go through the Palin e-mails -- inconsequential as they turned out to be --STEWART: Right.WALLACE: -- but they never said help us go through the 2,000 pages of the Obama health care bill?STEWART: Because I think their bias is towards sensationalism and laziness. I wouldn't say it's towards a liberal agenda. It's light fluff. So, it's absolutely within the wheelhouse.I mean, if your suggestion is that they are relentlessly partisan and why haven't they gone and backed away from Weiner? Now, they jumped into the Weiner pool -- so, with such delight and relish, because the bias --WALLACE: Some things are indefensible.STEWART: -- the bias of the mainstream media -- oh, I'm not saying it's defensible, but the bias of the mainstream media is toward sensationalism, conflict and laziness.WALLACE: You take your own shot recently at Sarah Palin. You compared her video of her one bus -- One Nation bus tour to a certain commercial. Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As the tour rolls on.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Stopping at historic places, like Gettysburg, and then to Philadelphia, to see the Liberty Bell.STEWART: You know what's cool, man? The way they have reporters finishing each other's sentences. Where have I seen that technique before?(CUE VALTREX AD)(END VIDEO CLIPS)WALLACE: Sarah Palin and the herpes drug, really?STEWART: Yes, as a technique for the commercial? You know, so, you're saying that by comparing the technique that she used in her video --WALLACE: You are not making a political comment?STEWART: You really think that's a political comment?WALLACE: Yes.STEWART: You're insane.WALLACE: Really?STEWART: Yes. Here is the difference between you and I -- I'm a comedian first. My comedy is informed by an ideological background. There's no question about that.The thing that will never understand and the thing that in some respect conservative activists will never understand is that Hollywood, yes, they're liberal. But that's not their primary motivating force. I'm not an activist. I'm a comedian.WALLACE: All right. I want to thank you for saying that because --STEWART: Yes?WALLACE: Baltimore Sun TV critic David Zurawik -- put it up on the screen -- says that is your dodge. ""Stewart has never held accountable in his media criticism, is he? When he is wrong, he goes in a tap dance of saying he's only a comedian and shouldn't be taken seriously.""STEWART: OK. Let's talk about that -- when did I say to you I'm only a comedian? I said I'm a comedian first. That's not only. Being a comedian is harder than what you do.What I do is much harder. I put material through a process, a comedic process.WALLACE: But you are a political commentator. The comedy has a political --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Here is your take on GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)HERMAN CAIN (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: That's why I only allow small bills. Three pages. You'll have time to read that one over the dinner table.STEWART: If I am president, treaties will have to fit on the back of a cereal box. From now, on the ""State of the Union"" address will be delivered in the form of a fortune cookie. I am Herman Cain, and I do not like to read.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIPS)WALLACE: You're planning a remake of ""Amos 'n' Andy""?STEWART: Why don't you show -- do you want to show me doing the voices for all the other people that we do? You want to see my New York voice? My Chinese guy voice?Are you suggesting that you and I are the same? Are you suggesting that -- what am I at my highest aspiration and what are you at your highest aspiration? Tell me.WALLACE: I think -- honestly, I think you want to be a political player.STEWART: You are wrong. You're dead wrong. I appreciate what you're saying.Do I want my voice heard? Do I want my voice heard? Absolutely. That's why I got into comedy.Am I an activist in your mind, an ideological partisan activist?WALLACE: Yes.STEWART: OK. Then I disagree with you.You can't understand because of the world you live in that there is not a designed ideological agenda on my part to affect partisan change because that's the soup you swim in. I appreciate that. I understand that. It reminds me of, you know -- you know, ideological regimes. They can't understand that there is free media other places. Because they receive marching orders.WALLACE: How do you explain me? Do you think I get my marching orders?STEWART: I think that you are here in some respects to bring a credibility and an integrity to an organization that might not otherwise have it, without your presence. So, you are here as a counterweight to Hannity, let's say, or a counterweight to Glenn Beck, because otherwise, it's just pure talk radio and it doesn't establish the type of political player it wants to be.WALLACE: It's a part.STEWART: But for you, there is hope -- this is important.WALLACE: No, this is -- but you sound like.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: -- during the CNN debate.STEWART: Am I dodging you? Am I dodging you by saying I'm just a comedian?WALLACE: No, you're filibustering. Here is the question. Here is the question.And I think there are plenty of examples. Let me give you another example of -- this isn't you. This is the mainstream media.Here's Diane Sawyer.STEWART: All right.WALLACE: Diane Sawyer, leading her program last year, announcing the new immigration law. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DIANE SAWYER, ""ABC WORLD NEWS"": If a stranger walking down the street or riding the bus does not seem to be a U.S. citizen, is it all right for the police to stop and question him? Well, today, the governor of Arizona signed a law that requires police to do just that.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: But that isn't what the law requires them to do. In fact, the law says the only way that you can stop somebody as part of a lawful enforcement stop, you can't just say, hey, you're walking down the street exactly as she suggested. It has to be because there's a broken taillight or they're loitering, or they're do something else.Don't you think she should have mentioned that?STEWART: Sure. Yes. No, I think you're right. I think we should have more full context and more of the types of things that you're talking about.But I don't understand how that's purely a liberal or conservative bias. That's, like I said, sensationalist and somewhat lazy.But I don't understand how that's partisan. The embarrassment is that I'm given credibility in this world because of the disappointment that the public has in what the news media does.WALLACE: I don't think --STEWART: -- not because I have an ideological agenda.WALLACE: I don't think our viewers are the least bit disappointed with us. I think our viewers think, finally, they're getting somebody who tells the other side of the story.STEWART: Right.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: And in -- no, no, no. One more example.STEWART: Who are the most consistently misinformed media viewers? The most consistently misinformed? Fox, Fox viewers, consistently, every poll.WALLACE: Can we talk about your network? Can we talk about Comedy Central?STEWART: Yes. I'd be delighted to.WALLACE: Because case and point --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How did you physically have sex with Tommy Lee? He has a huge (EXPLETIVE DELETED). If he put that thing in front of my face, I wouldn't know whether I should (EXPLETIVE DELETED) spit or feed it a peanut.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: That's not exactly ""Masterpiece Theater"" you're working for.STEWART: You're damn right. And I think I'm perfectly placed. I think that is my -- that is where I belong.WALLACE: You're the counterbalance to that. I'm suggesting that there is bias, and that you only tell part of the story.STEWART: Oh, there's no question that I don't tell the full story. I mean, I don't disagree with that. But I don't not tell the full story based on a purely ideological partisan agenda. That's my point. My point isn't --WALLACE: I think your agenda is more out there, and you're pushing more of an agenda than you pretend to.STEWART: But it's about absurdity. It's about absurdity and it's about corruption. And that is the agenda that we push.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: I will defend everything that we put on this show.STEWART: Oh, and by the way, how often do you see your show on my show? My beef isn't with you.WALLACE: OK.STEWART: But I believe you exist as -- I think that Mr. Ailes has very brilliantly put you on. And I think you're a tough interviewer. I think you're a fair interviewer. I think some of the things that --WALLACE: Keep going.WALLACE: Are you disappointed in Barack Obama as president?STEWART: Yes, I think I am.WALLACE: Do you think he's lived up to his promise to fix the economy?STEWART: No. I don't know the kind of sway that a president can have on the economy, but do I believe that he is lived up to the promises? No.He came in and said you can't expect to have a different result with the same people. That was, in many ways, his seminal campaign focus. And all I see as far as economic stewardship are the guys that got us into this mess in the first place.WALLACE: Honestly, did you watch any of the CNN debate with the Republicans?STEWART: Mm-hmm.WALLACE: Did you see anybody on the stage who you could envision voting for against Obama?STEWART: I thought that in general, you know, their responses to things in terms of tax cuts being the magic bullet as to what it is -- so far, I haven't heard anything that appeals to my sense of, that intrigues me politically, or in any way that is different. What intrigued me about Obama was a statement that I thought he understood the corrosiveness of the system that existed, and I thought he was going to do more to blow the system up.WALLACE: When is the last time you voted for a Republican for president?STEWART: For president? H. W.WALLACE: Against Michael Dukakis?STEWART: That's right.WALLACE: Really? How come?STEWART: He seemed like a different -- there was an integrity about him that I respected greatly. And there's something about tiny people in helmets. I assume that part of this is to delegitimize criticism against Fox by suggesting that it's coming from a place of contrived political --WALLACE: I'm just trying to understand you.STEWART: Is that really true?WALLACE: Yes.STEWART: Because here's the thing that surprises me about that. I've existed in this country forever. There have been people like me who satirize the political process and who have satirized -- what was it that Will Rogers said? How crazy is it when politicians are a joke and comedians are taken seriously?WALLACE: That assumes a kind of -- and this is where I think you're wrong and you don't get it --STEWART: That may be right.WALLACE: -- is that there is not a single marching order. There is not some kind of command. There is not a talking point memo. I'm saying --(CROSSTALK)STEWART: Well, that I disagree with.WALLACE: I am sitting here talking to Jon Stewart and I'm trying to get it, trying to understand you, and trying to see whether or not you recognize that what I believe is true, that there is as much bias the other side as you subscribe to Fox, and why you seem to go easy on that.STEWART: I think that there is a -- probably a liberal bias that exists within the media that is because of the medium in which it exists. I think that the majority of people working in it probably hold liberal viewpoints, but I don't think that they are as relentlessly activist as the conservative movement that has risen up over the last 40 years.And that movement has decided that they have been victims of a witch hunt. And to some extent they're right.People on the right are called racists and they're called things with an ease that I am uncomfortable with -- and homophobic and all those other things. And I think that that is absolutely something that they have a real right to be angry about and to feel that they have been vilified for those things. And I've been guilty of doing some of those things myself.WALLACE: I accept your apology.(LAUGHTER)WALLACE: I want to thank you for coming on.STEWART: Do you get me?WALLACE: Well, you know what? When you come back we can explore this some more.STEWART: All right.WALLACE: And we validate.STEWART: Still? You're a good man.WALLACE: Up next, we'll ask our Sunday panel why the Democrats are missing in action when it comes to laying out a plan to deal with the nation's debt problem.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Last week, after I interviewed Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty about his economic plan, I got a number of e- mails like this one.Matt D. from Effingham, Illinois, wrote, ""You were ridiculously tough and specific on Tim Pawlenty. Good. That's your job.""""When have you or anyone else ever been equally as tough on Obama? How could you be? Obama has no plan.""Matt makes a good point, which is why we're going to discuss that now with our panel: Bill Kristol of The Weekly Standard; Mara Liasson from National Public Radio; former Bush press secretary Dana Perino; and Bill Burton, former deputy press secretary to President Obama, who now heads Priorities USA, an independent political group.And welcome, Bill. Good to have you on the panel.BILL BURTON, FMR. DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY TO PRESIDENT Obama: Thank you.WALLACE: The president submitted a budget in February, Bill, which he replaced with an outline in April. Congressional Democrats didn't pass any budget last year. And the Senate Democrats haven't written a budget this year.Is that any way to leave the country?No, I'm asking -- not you.BILL KRISTOL, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: My answer is no.Bill, you can explain it. And it's really a good way to lead the country, to back off your original budget that was submitted a few months ago, so, laughably, doesn't address the debt and the deficit.To criticize Paul Ryan's serious attempt to address the debt and the deficit in April in a demagogic way, and then still not to have submitted any particulars, and the Senate, which the Democrats control, has not passed a budget resolution, whereas perhaps Republicans stepped up to the plate and passed a budget.WALLACE: And what do you think that's about?KRISTOL: I think it's about the president not showing leadership in dealing with the debt and deficit, or in dealing with jobs. I mean, we have a bad economy. And it's really the first time I remember when it's a bad economy and the president seems almost paralyzed.And what's his economic agenda? What's his jobs agenda? What's his growth agenda? What's his debt and deficit agenda? And the answer is attacking Republicans when they suggest other things.WALLACE: All right. Let me bring in Bill Burton.The president, in not this budget, but in the outline, the April outline, sets all kinds of targets. He talks about cutting about a half-trillion dollars from Medicare and Medicaid through unspecified inefficiencies. He talks about forming the tax code, but again, not very specific. As we point out, Senate Democrats haven't even written a budget this year.Is that showing leadership when the country faces a national debt crisis?BURTON: Well, for starters, it looks like there is going to be a Senate budget that will be introduced coming soon. But I will say --WALLACE: They're pretty late in the process. It's June.BURTON: Well, the government hasn't stopped working. And what's important here is, what are we going to do about jobs? What is the government going to do to try to get jobs going?We can talk about the context. That's not how this election is going to be run. But the president has created 2.1 million jobs in this recovery. The economy is growing and not contracting.And if you look down the road, what the president wants to do is he wants to get some trade deals passed that will help to create jobs. And there's a series measures that had they passed, had Republicans allowed them to go forward, be it the small business bill, be it some unemployed benefits, be it off-shoring bills, we could have created a lot more jobs than we could have otherwise.Now, I will give it to the congressional Republicans, yes, there was specificity in that budget they passed. But it's not really a serious document in the sense that if you are talking about gutting Medicare to turn it into a voucherized program, that's not something that's going to pass the United States Senate and get signed into law by the president.So, I would say that the president is doing what he can to get jobs created in this country. He has had some success, would like to have more. But he's not exactly had an able partner in the congressional Republicans.WALLACE: Is this all, Dana, the failure of Republicans to be an able partner? And how do you explain -- Bill kind of gives them a pass -- the failure to come up with a serious budget?DANA PERINO, FMR. WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I mean, it's been 781 days since the Senate Democrats have passed a budget. And what that means is that if you want to have power, the control of the purse, then you have to step up.Remember, in 781 days, the Democrats ran both the House and the Senate, and had the executive branch, and they still didn't do it. So it's interesting to see Democrats try to pin that back on Republicans. And in some ways, Republicans fall for it.They are like, well, we do have a plan. And they did put forward a plan. It's immediately -- you know, you talk about the bipartisanship, that's something that is earned and it's not just a given.And I think that the executive branch would be smarter to try to co-opt some of the Republican ideas to actually put something through. If they're going to put forward a budget, that's fine, but it's coming up against everything where, after two-and-a-half years, the communications problems that they have, have solidified. And it will be increasingly difficult to get something serious done in the next few months.WALLACE: I'm going to bring in Mara in a second.But Bill, I want to go back specifically to this point. No budget. I credit Dana with having actually counted the number of days, 700 days. It's pretty remarkable.BURTON: Right, but sort of meaningless in the context that what's important is, are jobs being created?(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: I don't mean to -- but part of is it a budget. A country needs a budget to run. Forget the jobs for a second.BURTON: Right, but the country is still running. Like, we're doing OK without a budget in the sense that nothing is shutting down.The Congress can still pass the jobs measures that the president wants to move forward. Congress can still move forward on a lot of the different things that will help to actually create jobs and grow the economy.We have made progress on jobs, 2.1 million in this recovery. The economy is growing as opposed to contracting.There's a lot more that need to get done. I don't know that the budget is necessarily the be all, end all as it relates to how we're actually going to get to economy on a track that's going to have sustained growth.WALLACE: Mara?MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: I think that, clearly, the battle cry of president has no plan, he's not leading. That's the Republican talking point. And I think the White House made a calculated decision that it was worth taking the hits on leadership for not having a new scorable budget, because the speech he gave in April didn't include a scorable plan.But he does have the outline of a plan. He wants $4 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years. And now decides --WALLACE: Twelve years.LIASSON: I'm sorry, 12 years. And now, both sides are in negotiations. And the only thing that is going to pass in this divided government is something that has been negotiated by both sides.That's what the debt ceiling talks are about. And if they come up with something that raises the debt ceiling, that gets $2 trillion worth of cuts, I always say this -- presidents have unlimited abilities to run to the front of the parade and grab the flag. And that will become Barack Obama's plan when those negotiations are successful.Now, if they are not successful, it will be really, really bad, because we'll default on the debt, and then our interest rates will go sky high. But that's what will become his plan.WALLACE: Which brings us to this question of negotiations, Bill, to the big news this weekend, whether it's serious or just style, and that was the golf summit -- and yes, we do have pictures of it -- between President Obama and Speaker Boehner. We don't know if business got done there. From their point of view, I kind of hope that they weren't sitting talking about the debt or the War Powers Act.But, first of all, do you think this does any good for them to sit and slap each other's back and spend a few hours together in a less formal situation? And what do you think are the chances that there will be a substantive deal on the debt and the deficit before we run into what Treasury Secretary Geithner says is this drop dead date of August 2nd?KRISTOL: I don't know. I have been doubtful that there would be a major deal.I've been struck that Vice President Biden and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor seem pretty hopeful about a deal. I'm worried about it in the sense that I think it could be a very weak deal that I think a lot of conserves in the country are going to have trouble with it. And I think the politics of --WALLACE: Well, wait a minute. Are you suggesting that the Republicans are going to sell out?KRISTOL: Yes. Well, not sell out. I think that you get in the room with the president, you get bludgeoned by the treasury secretary with partly phony threats about how we're about to default on everything, and then you cut a deal.And I think the politics of that are dicey for both parties and dicey for the country. But I think if I were Michele Bachmann, I would already be writing my speech on the House floor on August 2nd, denouncing with deep regret, of course -- a speech given in sorrow, not anger -- denouncing Speaker Boehner for cutting a bad deal with the president and not for not insisting on serious spending cuts and serious reforms and serious budget cuts and the prospect of a balanced budget in the near future. And I think that would be a pretty powerful speech for Michele Bachmann to give on the floor of the House.LIASSON: I think you can predict that she's going to do that no matter what. And they're not just getting pressured by Tim Geithner. They're getting calls from wall Street, they're getting calls from all of their constituents and their big donors saying you better raise the debt ceiling.KRISTOL: Really?LIASSON: Yes. Yes.PERINO: I heard the opposite.KRISTOL: Yes. LIASSON: Well, they've been reassuring Wall Street that the debt ceiling will go up. That's why Wall Street didn't react badly when they had that symbolic vote not to raise it. And I think if all of a sudden, they reach the debt ceiling, I think there will be a bad reaction from the markets. The markets think it's going to go up.KRISTOL: They're mostly reassuring Wall Street that they're going to cut spending down the road.LIASSON: Yes.KRISTOL: And we're not going to have trillion-dollar deficits forever.LIASSON: Yes. And there will be cuts in spending.WALLACE: We're running out of time and I want to touch on one more subject, a little 2012 politics.Texas Governor Rick Perry, Dana, spoke at a Republican thing down in -- I love it, ""Republican thing"" -- down in New Orleans this week and this weekend. And apparently stole the show. Let's watch a clip.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. RICK PERRY (R), TEXAS: That mix of arrogance and audacity that guides the Obama administration is an affront to every freedom- loving American and a threat to every private sector job in this country.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: What's your guess? Does Rick Perry get in the race? And if he does, how formidable a candidate is he?PERINO: About six weeks ago I would have said no, but in the last three weeks I have seen him come out.He gave a speech similar to this one in terms of passion in New York last week. And in some ways, you know, people have talked about how boring the field is, there's no passion, there's no emotion. And he brings that to the table. And so I think that he is a little bit closer to running, and we'll see what happens.WALLACE: And if he does, do you think he goes right up near the top of the field?PERINO: Potentially. I mean, I will get criticized for this, but you do need to have an organization. You need to have an ability to do some good fund-raising, people in the states in order to help you through those first primary states.They've got a little bit of time, not a ton of time. I would say he will probably announce by, you know, the end of July if he's going to get in or not.WALLACE: Bill, do Democrats worry about Rick Perry? And how would you go after him?BURTON: Well, as an observer, I think it would be pretty exciting if he got into the race. If you watched that debate earlier this week, it was fairly boring, frankly. And Rick Perry, if nothing else, is a showman and would make things pretty exciting.Rick Perry, though, is a pretty extreme version of George W. Bush. And my guess is that he may get in. He even could get the nomination. But I think the choice between a guy like President Barack Obama and a person like Rick Perry would be a --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: But when you say an extreme George W. Bush, extreme in what way?BURTON: Well, he wouldn't be the first candidate for president who thought that secession was a good policy, but he probably would be one who ended up losing.WALLACE: So that's the way that you end up -- you would go after him, you would target him as --BURTON: I think that no mater who the candidate is, be it Pawlenty, Romney, Perry, Bachmann, this is going to be about the economy and who is better for your family's future. I think that there are extreme elements of what Rick Perry has done in the past besides just --WALLACE: Rick Perry has had huge job growth. It's the biggest job-producing state in the country.BURTON: But on thee bottom on education, on the bottom on the unemployed, on the bottom of a lot of differentWALLACE: We're going to have to leave it there.

""He came across as knowledgeable on the direction of our domestic policy.""But Kay Anderson from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, disagreed. ""If they cannot answer your questions in a straightforward way, then that shows they either do not know what they're talking about or do not want the American people to hear the real answer.""And then there was an exchange on ""The Factor"" over whether Tim Pawlenty was to bland to run for president.Cynthia Y.

There are differences between myself and Senator Obama, and there are very big differences between myself and John McCain.And I have to admit to being somewhat surprised when I saw that Senator McCain had said that he would try to continue to privatize Social Security along the lines of what President Bush tried and failed in doing in 2005. And, you know, that is a very significant difference between the two of us.So I'd be glad to take your questions.QUESTION: How important is Social Security to the residents of western Pennsylvania? We saw a lot of older people here, and as we interviewed them we asked and they said that was a big issue. So how important is that?AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyCLINTON: Well, it's a big issue across the country. But Pennsylvania, as you know, has a higher percentage of older people than most states. So it's a particular concern to a lot of Pennsylvanians, who are on Social Security, you know, like the couple that we heard from earlier today who keep seeing their expenses increase and realize that they are in a very difficult position trying to afford all of the necessities of life and being on a fixed income like they are.Continue reading the main storyThat's why it's so important that we do everything we can to meet the long-term challenges of Social Security. The Social Security trustees just issued a report, actually while I was speaking, and there has been some improvement in the outlook for Social Security, according to the Social Security trustees. So I think that it reinforces what I've said for a long time, which is that we have some long-term challenges, it is not a crisis, we can fix what's, you know, needing to be changed in Social Security. Our real challenge is Medicare, which is much more in crisis and deserves closer attention.QUESTION: Now that Senator Obama has released his tax returns, will you release yours prior to April 15th, and will you release the entire documents along with the schedules and everything?CLINTON: Well, I anticipate being able to release them shortly, I hope within the next week. And I am pleased that Senator Obama has released his tax returns. I think that's a good first step. Now he should release his records from being in the state senate and any other information that the public and the press need to know from his prior experience, because I think that, you know, we should continue to make available the information that we have. And I will be releasing my tax returns.QUESTION: Should Barack Obama have left his church after Jeremiah Wright made the comments that he did?CLINTON: Well, I answered a question in an ed board today that was very specific about what I would have done. And, you know, I'm just speaking for myself. And I was answering a question that was posed to me.But I think, given all we have heard and seen, he would not have been my pastor.I gave a speech at Rutgers, about a year ago, that was triggered by the Don Imus comments.And I said that it was time for standing up for what is right, for saying enough is enough, for urging that we turn a culture of degradation into a culture of empowerment, for saying that, while we, of course, must protect our right to freedom of expression, it should not be used as a license or an excuse to demean and humiliate our fellow citizens.Senator Obama spoke eloquently, at that time, as well.You know, we don't have a choice when it comes to our relatives. We have a choice when it comes to our pastors and the churches we attend.Everyone will have to decide these matters for themselves. They are obviously very personal matters. But I was asked what I would do if he were my pastor. And I said I think the choice would be clear for me.AdvertisementQUESTION: Are you not satisfied with Senator Obama's explanation about his relationship with his pastor, in his speech, then?CLINTON: I was asked what I would do.QUESTION: Are you not satisfied with his response...CLINTON: Well, that's a question that goes to him. I was asked what I would do. And I answered what I would do.QUESTION: Senator, now that you're talk about this a little more publicly than you have, does this mean this is on the table, when you talk to superdelegates?Is it on the table in the Democratic primary?CLINTON: I was asked what I would do. And I answered the question.QUESTION: I'm with the student newspaper, and we had a mock election here. And Obama took it. Why do you think that your numbers aren't as strong with young people?And why do you think young people should vote for you?CLINTON: Well, I think they're getting better. You know, I was very pleased at the reception that I've gotten here in Pennsylvania. And, you know, I did very well with young people in Ohio, Massachusetts, California.I think, in the course of this campaign, over the next month, we'll be reaching out to young people.And this is an exciting election. It's wonderful that more young people are getting involved. I understand that there was an increase in registration for young people in Pennsylvania. So I intend to do everything I can to win as many votes as possible.But I think I've put forth very specific plans as to what I would do as president to deal with a lot of the problems that young people talk to me about, whether Social Security will be there, whether they'll be able to afford health care when they're no longer on their parents' policy, assuming that their parents have health insurance, how they'll afford college, what's going to happen in Iraq.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyCLINTON: So, I have been very specific and I'll continue to do so because I don't think that this should be just about the next election; I think it should be about the next generation.QUESTION: You misspoke regarding your trip to Bosnia, presumably about the sniper fire and running into the cars.After looking at the CBS video, that didn't -- exactly wasn't what happened.But on February 29th, when we were in Waco, you gave a similar account saying that there was sniper fire and that you were running into cars.Did you misspeak again, and what exactly -- how are Americans supposed to, sort of, take what happened here?CLINTON: You know, I made a mistake in describing it. I have said many times, I've talked about this many times that we were, you know, very much told by the Secret Service and the military that we were going into a war zone and that we had to be conscious of that. I was the first first lady taken into a war zone since Eleanor Roosevelt.And, you know, I think that the military and the Secret Service did a terrific job. But we certainly did take precautions. There is no doubt about that, and I remember that very clearly.But I did make a mistake in talking about it the last time and recently.But, look, this is really about what policy experience we have and who's ready to be commander in chief. And I'm happy to put my experience up against Senator Obama's any day.QUESTION: The people of Pennsylvania really support Ed Rendell and a lot of people are wondering what you think of him and if there's a possibility this he may be one of your choices for a running-mate, if you would secure the nomination.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyCLINTON: Well, it would be premature for me to talk about something like that but I am a big fan of Ed Rendell. I have been an admirer of his work when he was mayor of Philadelphia, now as governor. He has been visionary, effective, strong, provided the kind of leadership that Pennsylvania clearly has responded to very positively.And he's been ahead on a lot of the issues that are important from home foreclosures to energy. And I just think that he is an exceptional leader and I'm proud to have him on my team and leading my campaign in Pennsylvania.QUESTION: Republicans now saying that it's a pattern of exaggeration on Bosnia with the three events that they sent out with the same kind of story.How do you respond to that claim, that this is sort of a pattern that's developed?CLINTON: Well, I just disagree with that. You know, look, I made a mistake. And, you know, I had a different memory. And, you know, my staff and others have, you know, all kind of come together trying to sort out. So I made a mistake. That happens. It proves I'm human, which, you know, for some people, is a revelation.(LAUGHTER)QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) I'm curious what it was like to be inside the right-wing conspiracy?(LAUGHTER)Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

We had a wide-ranging discussion about a lot of domestic and foreign policy issues. And, you know, I said in the beginning when I arrived that it was obviously, somewhat counter intuitive for me to be there but it was a good discussion.QUESTION: You know, there are some in Washington who are saying the race is over. And some in the media are saying the race is over. And you made to say that you're going on. Are you receiving pressure to get out of the race or are you feeling...CLINTON: No, but I hear it in the atmosphere.CLINTON: But the most common thing that people say to me, it happened here, it happened last night, it happens everywhere now, is, ""Don't give up, keep going. We're with you."" And I feel really good about that because that's what I intend to do.QUESTION: Senator, can you talk about Tibet at all? Are you concerned about what's going on there?CLINTON: I am.Continue reading the main storyQUESTION: And specifically, should the U.S. consider not going to China for the Olympics as a result of this?CLINTON: Look, I think that what's happening in Tibet is deeply troubling. And this is a pattern of the Chinese government with respect to their treatment of Tibet. I actually raised that issue with Chinese leadership going back a number of years.I don't think we should wait until the Olympics to make sure that our views are known. And I think we should be speaking out through our administration now in a much more forceful way and, you know, supporting people in Tibet who are trying to preserve their culture and their religion from tremendous pressure by the Chinese.QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)CLINTON: Let's wait on that. I don't have an opinion about that.QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) home foreclosures and said that -- I don't know if you've seen the quote, but he said it is not the duty of the government to bail out and reward those who act irresponsibly, whether they be big banks or small borrowers. He basically was saying we should wait until the government steps in.We certainly heard your remarks yesterday, but what do you think about Senator McCain's?CLINTON: Well, it sounds remarkably like Herbert Hoover. And I don't think that's a good economic policy. You know, we have a framework of regulation. It needs to be updated and modernized.The government has a number of tools at its disposal that are well-suited for just this situation.CLINTON: And I think that inaction has contributed to the problems we face today. And I believe further inaction would exacerbate those problems.So I laid out what I would do, and I don't think it's an adequate response to say the government shouldn't be helping either banks or people. Because I think that would be a downward spiral that would cause tremendous economic pain and loss in our country. And I don't see why we should wait by for that to happen.QUESTION: Your campaign and your -- you and your campaign have been talking about Florida and Michigan, saying that Obama wants to disenfranchise voters there by not backing re-votes.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIf this ends up going to the convention and the superdelegates decide, how is that not disenfranchising voters?CLINTON: Well, look, I think that what we have to wait and see is what happens in the next three months. And there's been a lot of talk about what-if, what-if, what-if. Let's wait until we get some votes.People are going to vote, over the next months. Millions of people are going to vote. And we should wait and see the outcome of those votes.QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)CLINTON: No, no, I didn't say that.QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)CLINTON: I was joking. I mean, you know, gosh, lighten up, guys. I mean, obviously, come on. I say millions of words every week, and there's a lot more, you know, room for error when you're talking as much as I'm talking, but, no.QUESTION: For the government to buy mortgages or even guarantee them, that's going to cost money. How do you do that and still be fiscally responsible, without, you know, increasing the deficit?CLINTON: Well, there are two things about that. One is, you know, the fund that I have proposed would be part of the stimulus package. Because I think we need a second stimulus, because we didn't do anything about housing, despite, you know, my strong urging that we do. And then it's important to realize that the plan that Barney Frank and Chris Dodd have talked about could very well be self- financing over time, so that, you know, within a certain number of years, the Treasury -- the budget would not be out any money.But that's why I want to bring in some outside experts, like I suggested yesterday, to help plan this.CLINTON: Because, obviously, this is uncharted waters. We haven't done anything like since the Great Depression when an agency was created and it did buy mortgages. We're not at that point yet. The congressional proposal is to auction them off to private buyers. I have my doubts as to whether that would work, so we need a backstop for some kind of a government purchasing potential as well.But I think you could do this over time in a way that was not damaging to the federal budget.Now, obviously, we have a lot of other damage we have to clean up inherited from President Bush and the Republican Congress. But I think this could be managed effectively.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) a step further, though, by saying that the federal housing authority could buy (OFF-MIKE).CLINTON: Right. Well, what I said is that I think that should be considered. You know, I support what Senator Dodd and Congressman Frank have proposed, but I'm just not convinced that it alone will work. I think it's part of a plan, but not the complete plan. That's why I want to get this emergency working group to come in and try to give us the best suggestions about how to proceed.I personally think we will have to have as a backstop the ability of the FHA or some federal entity to be able to buy, because you don't even know how many buyers are out there.And, remember, what we're asking is that people come in and bid in an auction on buying these mortgages. They have to believe, the people bidding, that they can make money out of it.The way you would have to make the money is that you'd have to negotiate with homeowners to help them get a payment plan that would actually keep them in their homes and give you a revenue stream that would be profitable.A lot of the potential buyers have no capacity to do that. You know, a hedge fund doesn't have people who can go out and talk to home buyers. They'd have to put that together. Whereas, the FHA and the government would be able much more easily to provide those services.So I think that the number and type of potential buyers in such an auction might not be sufficient for what it is we're facing.CLINTON: And that's why I thought there should be the back-up from the government to be able to buy and work out those mortgages by the government.QUESTION: Questioning or discussing someone's relationship with their pastor is a very personal matter. And as you know, there are some Democrats who are concerned about the tone of the campaign being negative, being personal. Are those concerns justified?AdvertisementAnd do your remarks which you carefully -- which you are careful to read...CLINTON: Right.QUESTION: Do you think those concerns are justified?CLINTON: Well, as I said, it is a very personal matter. And I was asked a personal question. And I responded as to what I would have done. And, you know, everybody has to answer that for themselves because it is a personal consideration. And obviously, you take into all -- into account all kinds of factors.But when asked a direct question, I gave a direct answer. And I feel very comfortable with that. I don't think that's negative. That's what I would have done. And other people can evaluate that for themselves and make their own conclusions as to what they would have done.CLINTON: Thank you."

Aside from immigration, Bush’s advocacy for Common Core State Standards has earned him enmity on the right. Bush has repeatedly explained the standards, implemented and controlled by the states, are designed to make the United States more competitive with the rest of the world. He said those who oppose the standards support the “status quo,” oppose testing and are worried too much about children’s self-esteem. “Let me tell you something. In Asia today, they don’t care about children’s self esteem. They care about math, whether they can read – in English – whether they understand why science is important, whether they have the grit and determination to be successful,” Bush said. “You tell me which society is going to be the winner in this 21st Century: The one that worries about how they feel, or the one that worries about making sure the next generation has the capacity to eat everybody’s lunch?”

One of its videos, recorded in secret and released July 14, 2015, shows members of the anti-abortion group posing as tissue brokers discussing terms for procuring fetal tissue.To some, it appeared that Planned Parenthood was proposing to illegally sell tissue, prompting lawmakers in several states to launch investigations and Republicans in Congress to attempt cutting off more than $500 million in federal money. But Planned Parenthood maintains that its process is legal and limited to a handful of states.Confused about what’s going on? We’re here to help. Here’s our rundown of eight things we know — and don’t know — about fetal tissue donation and Planned Parenthood.1. It is illegal to sell fetal tissue. But donations are legal.The National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 allows a woman to consent to donating fetal tissue after an abortion. The federal law sets restrictions that prevent the woman from knowing or having a say in how the tissue is used, or profiting from it.Fetuses also can’t be aborted for the specific purpose of using tissue, especially to sell it. The option can’t be discussed with the woman until after she has decided to have an abortion.Researchers have used fetal tissue since the 1930s; experimentation on the tissue was instrumental in eventually developing the polio vaccine. Current studies are using the tissue to research diseases like AIDS, muscular dystrophy and Parkinson’s disease.2. The law allows for ""reasonable"" fees to cover the group’s costs of donating the tissue.Part of the video shows Deborah Nucatola, senior director of medical services at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, telling undercover activists that tissues can be obtained for fees in the $30 to $100 range. Activists against abortion rights point to this as proof that Planned Parenthood is "" selling the body parts of aborted children .""But the 1993 law also makes allowances for ""reasonable payments associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue.""The fees Nucatola discusses in the video likely fall under that definition, experts told PolitiFact.3. Nothing specifies how much appropriate fees should be.What counts as a ""reasonable payment"" is not explicitly outlined in the law. Organizations don’t have to publicly report how much they are charging buyers that process the tissue and isolate specific cells before selling them to researchers. Activists in the videos were posing as brokers and went back and forth with Nucatola to get her to disclose Planned Parenthood’s fees.""The amounts she cites do not appear to be out of the ordinary, but no one knows because there is no registry or compendium of fees charged by organizations (or) institutions supplying fetal tissue,"" said Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Center. ""When she haggles about fees, that does not appear to me to be trying to profit.""4. There are no regulations for what brokers charge researchers, either.While abortion clinics or hospitals sometimes provide tissue directly to researchers, organizations or private companies like the tissue brokers mentioned above often act as middlemen. Profiteering may be occurring on this level, Caplan said.Caplan said brokers can resell tissue to researchers at what seem like fairly high markups, but ""regulations don't exist on fees, so what they charge is set by market.""California-based StemExpress is one such broker and is cited in one of the Center for Medical Progress videos as contracting with Planned Parenthood for fetal tissue. The company charges fees for many kinds of human cells, from $100 for a vial of peripheral blood to $24,000 for a vial of highly concentrated fetal liver cells. The company reported $2.2 million in revenue in 2013, according to a profile in Inc. Magazine.Prue Talbot, the director of the Stem Cell Center at the University of California, Riverside, agreed with a StemExpress statement that said research methods and expensive medical equipment are expensive. Talbot said skilled technicians that can isolate and preserve specific kinds of cells also command high salaries, driving up costs.5. Political pressure is driving the issue in some states.Since the videos were released, at least 12 states, including Florida, Texas, Georgia and South Carolina, have called for investigations into the organization’s tissue program.States follow the federal law, but Wisconsin legislators have vowed to ban fetal tissue donation in the fall. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a presidential candidate, canceled his state’s contract with Planned Parenthood even though the two facilities in that state don’t offer abortion services.""It is against the law for any organization to sell body parts,"" Florida Gov. Rick Scott said on July 29 . ""If a Planned Parenthood office is not following the law, we will move quickly to take legal and regulatory action against them.""Florida's health services agency announced Aug. 5 that three facilities would be cited for performing second-trimester abortions without a proper license and a fourth will be cited for improper recordkeeping following its investigation.6. Planned Parenthood says it only has donation programs in a few states. But we don’t know which ones.Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards has said her organization conducts tissue donations in ""less than five"" states.But no one — not from Planned Parenthood, its state affiliates or companies that procure the stem cells — will disclose the states where this happens.A spokeswoman for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the organization’s national wing, cited security concerns. So far, affiliates in Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire , Indiana and Florida have denied having any form of a tissue donation program.7. Federal law does not require Planned Parenthood to disclose this information on their tax forms.You may think that because Planned Parenthood receives federal money, it has to disclose more information about its business, including the fetal tissue donation locations.But that’s not the case.Planned Parenthood is a network of affiliated organizations that cooperate with each other, led by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. As a registered 501(c)(4) nonprofit, each affiliate only has to release a yearly tax report called a Form 990. On the 990, those affiliates have to list their five largest contractors, but don’t have to provide any other details about their operations.8. Abortions do not make up the majority of Planned Parenthood’s services. But neither do mammograms.The tissue donation controversy has reignited the country’s abortion wars, with advocates and critics alike slinging statistics about what Planned Parenthood really does.In a recent interview with GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, Fox Business reporter Smith said ""almost 95 percent of all their pregnancy services were abortions.""That rates False . The cherry-picked statistic traces back to a political action committee that opposes abortion. By the group’s measure, which considered only Planned Parenthood’s reported abortions, prenatal care services and adoption referrals, abortions made up 94 percent of Planned Parenthood’s ""pregnancy services."" But the majority of Planned Parenthood’s work does not focus on prenatal care, and the group does not keep records on how many pregnant women it refers to outside health care providers.Democratic presidential candidate and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley went the opposite direction, telling reporters ""97 percent of the work that Planned Parenthood does is about mammograms and preventative health.""That rates Half True. The 97 percent figure accounts for services other than abortion, including contraception, STD testing and treatment, cancer screenings, and more. Preventive care comprises about 85 to 90 percent of all their services. Mammograms are part of that group, but Planned Parenthood doesn’t offer mammograms. They perform breast exams and give referrals to outside clinics that provide mammograms.Editor's note: Hours after this story was published, Florida announced the results of its investigation into Planned Parenthood. The piece has been updated.AdvertisementResearchers: Anna Bruzgulis , Will Cabaniss , Lauren Carroll , Joshua GillinSources:"

Peter DeFazio and Earl Blumenauer are ""socialists who are openly serving in the U.S. Congress.""— Bloggers on Friday, August 12th, 2011 in web pagesBloggers claim Peter DeFazio and Earl Blumenauer are socialistsBy Charles Pope on Monday, August 29th, 2011 at 5:03 p.m.Bloggers are spreading a list of so-called socialists in Congress.Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio has been called a lot of things over his 12 terms in Congress -- hot head, visionary, renegade, principled, effective and determined.Now, if a burst of activity on websites and blogs in recent weeks is to be believed, DeFazio is something else -- a socialist.And he’s not alone. The posts, all of which piggyback from a single offering that has been replicated on dozens of websites in recent weeks, says there are 70 card-carrying Socialists in the House of Representatives, including Rep. Earl Blumenauer, another Democrat from Oregon. (The number actually varies. Some posts say 70 while others insist it’s either 73 or 76. One post used both 76 and 75 in the same entry.)An Aug. 12 post on the website for a group called Sovereign Citizens United mentions DeFazio and Blumenauer by name. It also says this: ""I’m sure if you asked random people on the street if we had open socialists in the US Congress, they would say – well only Bernie Sanders (Senate). But the right answer is much, much worse.""""This should come as a surprise to absolutely no one,"" says an Aug. 16 post on ConservativeByte.com . ""The radical Marxist-progressives (communists) took control of the Democrat party some time ago. They’ve only become more emboldened with the election of Barack Obama, who was raised as a communist from birth."" In case you miss the point, the post comes equipped with a large and very bright hammer and sickle emblem.While most of the names politicians are called are opinions, calling a congressman a Socialist sounds both emphatic and exact, which always gets our attention here at PolitiFact Oregon.Another thing that gets our attention is when a claim gets spread far and wide. This one meets that test, too.Here’s a blog post on Aug. 17 by Texas radio host Dan Cofall, whose show airs out of Fort Worth:""The magic number ‘70’ is the number of members of the 111th Congress who are members of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). These are not just politicians who vote left of center; these are card-carrying members of ‘The Democratic Socialists of America’.""Cofall did not respond to an email asking for comment. And we couldn’t reach anyone from ConservativeByte.Before we get to our ruling, let’s begin with some basics. Congress resets itself every two years, which means the current edition is the 112th Congress, not the 111th. Why does that matter? Because the new Congress that begins in January every two years always follows an election and some of the people on the list are no longer in office.Cofall acknowledges this but then continues to list names from the 111th Congress anyway. Those listed as ""card carrying"" socialists who are no longer serving include: Robert Wexler (Florida), Phil Hare (Illinois), John Hall (New York), Alan Grayson (Florida), and Neil Abercrombie (Hawaii).Then there’s this: Real card-carrying Socialists say those members, including DeFazio and Blumenauer, aren’t Socialists.The list that Cofall and dozens more rely upon ""is completely fraudulent,"" said Frank Llewellyn, who served as national director of the Democratic Socialists of America for 10 years until stepping down July 5.There is not one member of Congress who is a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. In order to join, a person must fill out a form and pay dues. Even Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, is not a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said.The last member of Congress who was an actual card-carrying member, he said, was California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums, who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998.Llewellyn and DSA’s new national director, Maria Svart are chagrined for two reasons. First, they have to spend time knocking down reports that never seem to go away.Second, Llewellyn said, ""if we had formal political relationships with 70-odd members, we would be making a lot more money’’ from dues.For the record, both DeFazio and Blumenauer say they’ve never been associated with the Democratic Socialists of America.""This is another made-up Internet rumor that has no merit,"" DeFazio said.""I am a proud Democrat who has taken many independent stands over the years. I am anti-so called free trade, pro-American jobs, pro-infrastructure investment, pro-fair taxation, anti-amnesty, pro-balanced budget amendment, pro-Wall Street re-regulation, and pro-audit the Pentagon and Federal Reserve. I am an Oregonian and an independent thinker.""Blumenauer was equally annoyed.""No matter which side of the political aisle it comes from, this kind of name calling and rhetoric represents exactly what is wrong with our democracy today,"" he said. ""Rather than bringing people together to solve our nation's problems, it spreads false and divisive allegations throughout the media and the public. It is a major distraction from the real work that needs to get done.""Bad information gets spread all the time. But where did the number, or numbers, come from?The list purported to have originated with the DSA says this on page two:Q: How many members of the U.S. Congress are also members of the DSA?A: SeventyIt then lists them by name. What it does not say is that the names are simply lifted en masse from the membership of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a collection of liberal-leaning lawmakers that includes DeFazio and Blumenauer but officially, not a single socialist.According to its website, the Progressive Caucus is one of the largest in Congress and works for such causes as economic justice, civil rights and civil liberties as well as global peace and security. Llewellyn said that DSA supports some of the policy positions of the caucus.Voicing support for positions embraced by a group of lawmakers is a routine part of business on Capitol Hill and is employed by organizations as disparate as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Rifle Association and NORML, a group devoted to legalizing the use of marijuana. But agreeing with some positions doesn’t make a member of Congress a card-carrying Socialist.Llewellyn says similar accusations of Socialism (with a capital S) have surfaced every election year since 1991 when the Progressive Caucus was created.""There’s nothing we can do to stop it, Llewellyn said. ""I can’t tell you the number of times we’ve tried to stop it.""Misinformation and smear campaigns also are part of political life. But these persistent claims about socialists are riddled with errors and outright lies. Any one of the problems would be sufficient to discredit the report, but taken together, the effort is flagrantly false. For that reason, we rate this claim: Pants on Fire."

Hillary Clinton's ""the only one who’s done it."" — Charles Schumer on Sunday, March 8th, 2015 in comments on CBS' ""Face the Nation""Fact-checking Chuck Schumer's defense of Hillary Clinton's private emailBy Steve Contorno on Sunday, March 8th, 2015 at 6:13 p.m.Hillary Clinton continues to face criticism for using a private email during her time as Secretary of State.Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton didn’t appear on the Sunday political talk shows to explain her use of a private email account to conduct State Department business. But Democrats were out in force to defend her as proxies.For example, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., appeared March 8 on CBS’ Face the Nation to throw cold water on accusations of wrongdoing on the part of Clinton.""The State Department asked all secretaries of state to send their emails over, and she’s the only one who’s done it,"" Schumer said.We decided to dig into Schumer’s claim. Spokesman Matt House said Schumer was referring to an October 2014 letter from the State Department to former secretaries of states.The letter has not been publicly published but its contents were outlined by State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf to the media last week. Harf said the letter was part of a routine effort to update record preservation and asked former secretaries to turn over emails containing state work conducted on personal accounts.A couple months after the request, Clinton turned over 55,000 pages of emails and documents from a personal email account created on a self-operated server, according to the New York Times and the State Department. Clinton has since requested ( via Twitter ) for those emails to be released.It’s not as though the letter went out to living secretaries of state dating back to Henry Kissinger. While it may be hard to remember a time before email, only four former secretaries have held the job during the prominence of electronic communications: Clinton, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright.As it is, the State Department query was limited to just those four individuals.Two of those individuals haven’t provided personal emails for good reason: They didn’t use email much during their time at the State Department. According to MSNBC , an aide for Albright said she ""did not use email while she was in office"" from 1997 to 2001.Similarly, Rice, head of the State Department from 2005 to 2009, was not a habitual emailer either, according to multiple reports. As Harf noted in a State Department briefing , ""Secretary Rice has repeatedly said that she did not regularly use email,"" and a spokesperson for Rice told ABC , ""She did not use personal email for official communication as secretary.""Essentially, two of the four former officials contacted didn’t turn any emails over because they didn’t have any to turn over. That’s pretty important context.And what about Powell, who served as Secretary of State during President George W. Bush’s first term? Powell appeared on ABC’s This Week to answers those questions.Apparently, Powell can’t turn over any documents. Why? Because he doesn’t have them anymore.""I retained none of those e-mails and we are working with the State Department to see if there's anything else they want to discuss with me about those emails,"" he said.""I did not keep a cache of them. I did not print them off,"" he added. ""I do not have thousands of pages somewhere in my personal files.""Harf acknowledged in a March 4 briefing that Powell's ""account has been closed for a number of years,"" and said, ""He’s looking to see if there’s anything responsive he still has.""You can draw your own conclusions about Powell not saving official emails from a 10-year-old account, and the relevance of that revelation to the Clinton controversy. Powell said most of his important correspondence would have been archived already, since they were sent to staff who had State Department accounts.But it does shed light on why Powell didn’t provide emails to the State Department, and it also demonstrates that he has taken steps to comply with the request, even if only recently.So to recap: The State Department reached out to four former secretaries asking about personal email accounts. Two have said they rarely used email, the third used personal email but had no records to turn over and the fourth was Clinton.That makes Schumer’s defense fairly hollow when you think about it.Clinton may have been the ""only"" person to provide emails, but realistically, that’s from a potential pool of two people.We took all this back to Schumer’s spokesman House. He stood by the comment.""There is another person (Powell) who specifically said he had emailed in a way that would be relevant to their request, but did not keep records so wouldn't be able to comply,"" House said. ""So she's the only one to do what State is asking.""Our rulingSchumer said, ""The State Department asked all secretaries of state to send their emails over, and (Clinton is) the only one who’s done it.""That statement is much more grandiose than the reality of the situation. The State Department asked four former secretaries of state for any official business conducted on personal emails. Two of those individuals, Albright and Rice, rarely used email at all while in office, let alone on a personal account. The other, Powell, has said his personal emails no longer exist, but said he is working with the State Department to recover them, if possible.The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.Correction: Clinton turned over 55,000 pages and documents from her private email account. A previous version of this fact-check described the number incorrectly.Advertisement"

Let -- let me -- and just in case some people don't know it. At 12 you were arrested for shop lifting? BROWN: Right down the street. WALTERS: You remember the place? OK. WALTERS: At 22 you posed nude for Cosmopolitan Magazine. For the past 30 years you've been in the National Guard, and you have the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. The past six years you've been a state senator, and now as the newly elected Republican senator from Massachusetts. You are the new star. I just saw that when I traveled a little bit with you. What do you most want to accomplish? What's your passion? BROWN: Well let me tell you what I'm most proud of. First of all that's being married for 23 years, and having two great kids. And I want to accomplish what I think is already starting to happen, which is to bring good government back to the equation. Have people come together and talk about issues out front -- transparent, and not behind closed doors. And I think that's happening as evidence – what happened with the president yesterday. WALTERS: Well you know there was -- when the president had the meeting with the Republicans. And that back and forth. And the president talked about the fact that both sides demonized the other. But it seems to be working for the Republicans. Are you -- do you feel pressure that as the 41st you'll have a tough time voting Republican all the way? BROWN: Everyone really is the 41st senator. And what it means is that now there will be full and fair debate. And there will be no more closed -- behind closed doors actions. And make no mistake, I am a fiscal conservative. And when it comes to issues affecting people's pockets, and pocketbooks, and wallets, I'll be with the Republicans if they are in fact pushing those initiatives. WALTERS: It has been said all over the country that your election was more about disappointment in the president than it was about voting for you in particular. BROWN: I have to respectfully disagree. People here spoke very loudly and -- and very plainly about taxes and spending, terrorism, and the health care proposal. WALTERS: Which means you -- which you represented? BROWN: That's correct. WALTERS: Yes. You know when I was with you just a little while ago with the crowd, one of the women said -- behind me -- said, ""President 2012."" And you said to me -- or under your breath, ""That's silly."" But do you rule it out? BROWN: I -- I have to -- I have to tell you, I don't even have a business card. I haven't even been sworn in. I don't have any exploratory committees started. I don't have any -- anything -- it's -- it's overwhelming, and it's extremely humbling. I don't know how -- what else to tell you. WALTERS: Let's talk about another rising star in the Republican party -- Sarah Palin. Do you think that Sarah Palin is presidential material? BROWN: Well -- well, sure. I mean, she's been a mayor, and a governor. And -- and has a lot of -- a national following. But I think the more people in a presidential race, the better. She's never contacted us, and vice-versa. WALTERS: Let's talk about some of your specific views. You are pro-choice, yes? WALTERS: And gay marriage is legal in the state of Massachusetts. But the Republican party platform language calls for the overthrow of Roe v. Wade, and they want a federal ban on gay marriage. Are you out of step with your party, or do you think that the party has to broaden, and change its platform? BROWN: Well I've always been a big tent person, you know? We need more people to come into our tent to express their views in a respectful and thoughtful manner. And, you know, Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, but I think we need to do more to reduce the amount of abortions. And the difference between me and maybe others is that I'm very -- I'm against partial-birth abortions. I'm against federal funding of abortions. And I believe in a strong parental consent notification law. And we should do more for adoptions. WALTERS: But you're still pro-choice? BROWN: Yes, because I feel this issue is best handled between a woman and her doctor and her family. And on the marriage issue that you brought up, it's settled here in Massachusetts, but I believe that states should have the ability to determine their own destiny and the government should not be interfering with individual states' rights on issues that they deal with on a daily basis. WALTERS: Well, there is the debate now in the Republican Party as to whether it should be more conservative or more moderate. Which direction do you bend? BROWN: They can do whatever they want. I just know that I'm a Scott Brown Republican. What does that mean? That means I'm going to go down there and be accountable, accessible, open, and honest, and I'm going to bring good government and fairness back to the equation. I'm a fiscal conservative. I care very deeply about -- because my mom was, as you probably know more than anybody is, you know, she was on welfare for a time. I remember getting the blocks of cheese and worrying about how we're going to pay the bills. So when it comes to fiscal issues, I'm going to be very, you know, conservative and concerned about people's dollars. WALTERS: And social issues, a little more moderate? BROWN: Yes, of course. WALTERS: The Tea Party movement was important to your victory. How influential do you think the Tea Party movement is going to be? BROWN: Well, you're making an assumption that the Tea Party movement was influential, and I have to respectfully disagree. It was everybody. I had a plurality... WALTERS: But it was part of it. BROWN: Of course, it was. WALTERS: OK. Let's talk about the president's State of the Union. OBAMA: ""I know it's an election year. And after last week, it is clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual."" WALTERS: Do you see any evidence in his speech that he got a message from your election? BROWN: On some issues, yes. I was encouraged that he was interested in doing, you know, nuclear power and doing some limited drilling under the proper circumstances. I felt his position on pointing out that Iran is certainly a very serious issue, and I'm hopeful that I can work with him on that. I thought how he's handling, obviously, Afghanistan -- I was very vocal in supporting his position on increasing the troops. I was encouraged by the fact that he's going to do a freeze on spending and, more importantly, also look at, you know, tax reductions. But I think we need to a little bit bolder. We need to make sure that we get a handle on spending and taxation. WALTERS: President Obama has asked for a spending freeze on almost everything except matters like the military, Social Security, and Medicare. He says he's going line by line through the budget. Now, you have said that's not enough for you; that you want to cut spending and not just freeze it. So what are the first 3 items that you would cut? BROWN: The problem with what the president said is he's not doing it until 2011. We need to do it immediately. We need to put a freeze on federal hires and federal raises because, as you know, federal employees are making twice as much as their private counterparts. I'm in favor of, you know, Judd Gregg's proposal, the bipartisan effort, almost like a BRAC closure... WALTERS: Which was defeated. BROWN: ... the base closing. And I thought the president did the right thing by saying through executive order he's going to bring it up. I would have supported the ability for him to do that. WALTERS: On Friday, President Obama announced what he called the ""best way to promote hiring,"" talking about jobs especially for the small businessmen. A $5,000 tax credit for each new employee added and tax relief for those companies that add to their payroll. A total cost is$33 billion dollars. If and when this became a bill, would you vote for it? Yes or no? WALTERS: Health care. Massachusetts requires that all residents purchase health insurance. You voted for that plan. WALTERS: So why doesn't it make sense that all Americans have health insurance? Why isn't what's good for Massachusetts good for the whole country? BROWN: In Massachusetts, the free market, the free enterprise has taken control, and they're offering a wide range of plans. I've never ever said that people should not get health insurance. It's just a question of if we're going to take a one-size-fits-all government plan or we're going to do something where the individual states can tailor their plans as we've done. WALTERS: Do you think the whole plan should be scrapped? WALTERS: The whole plan? WALTERS: You don't... BROWN: We need to go back to... WALTERS: ... see that there could be some things that could be -- goodbye to the whole plan? BROWN: I think it was on its last legs before I even got elected, because the Democrats even were upset at the backroom deals, for example, in Nebraska. And they want a chance, I believe, based on just what I'm hearing -- and I can't -- I'm not going to quote anybody directly -- that to go back to the drawing board and do it in a transparent, bipartisan manner --that's the big difference between Massachusetts and Washington. WALTERS: And then would you want it state by state? BROWN: I have to see what's being proposed. A lot of states want that flexibility. They do not want the federal government always being in their business saying you have to do it this way, this way, and this way. But other states may not have that ability. They may want more government involvement. WALTERS: There has been a good deal of criticism of President Obama's economic team. BROWN: I would have supported him. WALTERS: You would have? WALTERS: Well, he had a lot of criticism, but he's in. OK. Now, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner is on the hot seat. Should Tim Geithner be replaced? BROWN: The president has to work with the people he feels most comfortable with, as I do in my own staff -- as you do with the people that are here. And I think that if he feels comfortable with -- with Tim, then he -- he should keep him. WALTERS: You have been a member of the National Guard for 30 years. You've talked about how important that service is. WALTERS: You're a Lieutenant-Colonel. On Wednesday the president announced that he wants to work with Congress to repeal don't ask, don't tell. What's your view? BROWN: I think it's important, because as you know we're fighting two wars right now. And the most -- the first priority is to -- is to -- is to finish the job, and win those wars. I'd like to hear from the Generals in the field -- in the field -- the people that actually work with these soldiers to make sure that, you know, the social change is not going to disrupt our ability to finish the job and complete the wars. WALTERS: But Senator, your own view. BROWN: That's my view. WALTERS: So you can't say whether you're for or against it? BROWN: No. I'm going to wait to speak to the generals on the ground. WALTERS: President Obama said that in the last year there are more Al Qaeda terrorists including leaders captured or killed than in 2008. Now, obviously there are incidents like the one on Christmas day. Do you think that the president has made the country more safe? BROWN: I think -- I think -- I don't think it's just about the president. It's not his job. His job is to be our leader, and he delegates to the appropriate authorities to make those decisions. So I'm not going to give him a grade and say who did -- President Bush or President Obama -- who did the better job. I just want them to continue to do a good job, and I want to be able to provide, you know, my knowledge and my energy to helping. WALTERS: You know, as we've been talking, you've expressed several time the idea of working together, Republicans and Democrats working together, and your knowledge helping the president. Do you feel now that there is going to be this kind of cooperation or reconciliation? There's so much -- there's been so much anger and so much conflict. Do you think it's going it change? BROWN: Well, it happens in many presidencies. This isn't the first. The fact that the number is a 60-40 number has certainly contributed to that, you know, head-banging. So I'm hopeful. What I'm sensing from people is, yes, in fact, there is a new sense of openness and cooperation. I mean, has the president met with the Republican delegation before? I don't think so. WALTERS: But is it in part because of your election? WALTERS: So your election may bring the two parties closer together? BROWN: And I hope I'm on the front of the line, you know, leading the charge because we have some very serious issues affecting our, you know, jobs, our economy. We need to be not only the world's military leader but also its economic leader. And if we're not either one of those, then we're going to have troubles. WALTERS: So not just for you personally, but 41 has been a good number. Yes? BROWN: Well, it's been a great number for the country. It's been a great number for the country, and I'm so -- I'm so invigorated to get down there and just work together. WALTERS: You know, you replaced a beloved figure. BROWN: Yeah, he was a great guy. WALTERS: How do you think that Senator Ted Kennedy would feel about your election? WALTERS: Do you think he'd be disappointed? BROWN: Well, we had a relationship prior to this, and he was always very friendly and always would ask who's the better singer, my daughter or me. I know when I spoke to his wife, she was the first person I called. And I -- she was -- she was very gracious and appreciative. So I'll leave that up to, you know -- if he's watching, I'll, you know, maybe he'll kind of let us know how he feels. WALTERS: I'd like to talk a little bit about your growing up, your youth. Your parents divorced when you were a year old. BROWN: I'm not going to cry, by the way. OK. Just... WALTERS: How do you know I'm not going to make you cry? WALTERS: I'm not going to try to, Senator. OK? WALTERS: Each of your parents were married four times, and you've described them as having a violent marriage. At one point, you talked about when you were five or six years old having to feel you had to save our mom, and your dad wasn't around very much. Difficult childhood. How did this shape you? BROWN: Well, first of all, my parents were both loving, and they still are. When they were divorced, I was one years old, but they were always there for me. When I referred to the violence in the home, it was with my mom's husband -- a couple of husbands. And I do remember getting up in the middle of the night and, you know, having to be the man of the family and come and rescue her and getting knocked around pretty good. And it's made me appreciate my strong family and the fact that I have two great kids. I'm not going to cry. And, you know, I've learned from my parents' mistakes to do everything that they may have done wrong. WALTERS: In an interview to the Boston Globe back in 1982, you said, ""Sometimes... BROWN: Marian Christy, if I'm not mistaken. WALTERS: Yeah. ""Sometimes, I think I'm being tested by a higher being. When things are going great, I think of it as a reward from heaven."" Do you still think your winning is a reward from heaven? BROWN: Obviously, I was 22 years old there and thrust in the spotlight because of what I did with the Cosmo thing. I believe in God, and I am very thankful for the things that I've, you know, been blessed with. Is there -- is there a higher being that's looking out for people? I hope so. I'm hopeful. WALTERS: The Cosmopolitan Magazine. Well it just so happens, I have it. BROWN: Great. I'm sure you do. BROWN: Really? You're kidding, right? WALTERS: Here. I really do. I have the magazine. BROWN: Oh, yeah. The good old days. Do you want me to sign it? WALTERS: Actually -- I want you -- well, it's a thought. I could -- I could then sell it for a lot. BROWN: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. WALTERS: But this is... WALTERS: ... the actual picture. WALTERS: It's a -- it's a... BROWN: I wish I still looked like that. WALTERS: Well I'm not going to ask you to prove it. But this is pretty -- this is pretty raw stuff. OK. So... BROWN: That's Cosmo -- 1982 Cosmo. Let's not get carried away here. WALTERS: But at the economic conference in Davos, some of the foreign leaders -- that just took place last week -- were referring to you as that ""nude magazine guy."" WALTERS: Were you worried -- or are you worried that this can make you a little bit of a joke? BROWN: No. I was 22 years old. My -- my grandmother saw it. She laughed. You know, you have to have a sense -- have to have sense of humor about yourself. It wasn't Playgirl. It was Cosmo. You know being Bert Reynolds -- Arnold Schwarzenegger, John Davidson, David Hasselhoff also did it. And I'm the -- the only non, you know, famous person who did it back then. WALTERS: What would you say if one of your daughters came to you and said, ""Dad I want to pose nude?"" BROWN: Well I would leave it up to their discretion. I don't think that's in the -- in the cards though. WALTERS: You know some women have said to me, ""If a woman did a nude centerfold spread"" -- even if it was more than 20 years ago -- they're not sure that she would be elected senator, because there's a double standard. What do you think? BROWN: I think if someone is qualified, regardless of what they did in their youth -- we all make mistakes. I'm not perfect. And do I regret doing that? No. Cause if I hadn't done that, I never would have been sitting here with you. It's all connected. So is there a double standard? I hope not. If someone is qualified to do the job, they should be able to do it, regardless of what they've done in their past. WALTERS: Let's talk about your daughters. BROWN: ""In case anyone who's watching throughout the country they're both available. No, no no. No. Only kidding, only kidding."" WALTERS: Oh, I'll bet. I'll bet. WALTERS: Well one isn't available. BROWN: No. No. Her boyfriend was mad at me. But she -- she's good. WALTERS: Your daughter, Ayla was a contestant on American Idol... WALTERS: ... in 2006, at which time Simon Cowell described herperformance as... WALTERS: You remember. Robotic, and empty. WALTERS: Here's your chance. What would you like to say to Mr. Cowell? BROWN: I'd love to have him have her on the show again because she's grown as well. She was 17, and she had never even put on makeup until she walked in the American Idol studios. WALTERS: So you're asking him to please give her another chance? BROWN: I've love them to get together and have her get on ""Idol"" again. I think it would be great for her. It would be great for the show and let people know that there's life after ""Idol."" Sure. WALTERS: Well, there we go. We'll see if we get an answer from him. BROWN: Ayla actually respects Simon greatly about his critiquing even though he's kind of harsh, what he says -- if you actually listen to what he says, it was right. WALTERS: Senator, I have one final question. BROWN: ""I have 202,277 miles (laughter).The thing runs great too. I haven't had any trouble with it."" WALTERS: Will you be getting a new truck? BROWN: I think I'll eventually have to. I know American products are really good, but they eventually do wear out. I'm going to bring it down to Washington and use it as long as I can. It's a great truck. I live in the thing. WALTERS: Its days are numbered. BROWN: I live -- I mean, I change in it. I sleep in it. I eat in it. It's who I am. It's -- I'm just -- you know, I never thought the truck would be such a national symbol of freedom. WALTERS: I appreciate your doing this. WALTERS: Thank you very much. WALTERS: Well, now let's bring in our roundtable. George Will,Arianna Huffington from ""The Huffington Post,"" Paul Krugman, Nobel Prizewinning economist and columnist for the ""New York Times,"" and RogerAiles. And this is rather unusual for us and I think for him becauseMr. Ailes is the CEO and president of FOX News and this is his firstvisit with ABC News on ""This Week."" AILES: I was waiting for HD. I look so much better. WALTERS: I also -- you just said that when Scott Brown for $1,000for the cosmopolitan nude photograph, you would have done it for less. AILES: 1982, the guy's getting out of college and someone gives him$1,000 and he can cover himself up. I don't know, $100, I'd do it. WALTERS: We're not going to ask you today. OK, so here we go,George. Scott Brown. What do you think of him? How influential do youthink he's going to be? WILL: He is one percent of one-half of one of our three branches ofgovernment. That is he's one senator in an institution where like mostinstitutions, 80 percent of the work is done by about 20 percent of thepeople. Most of them senior senators. Furthermore, as he said in his interview, every Republican senatoris the 41st senator, therefore every one of them is a potentialobstructionist or extortionist, depending on what you say. So in thatsense, I think he will be of modest historic importance. WALTERS: So why the fuss, Paul? KRUGMAN: Well because we have a super majority system. Because wehave a system in which you cannot at this point get anything donewithout 60 points in the Senate. I mean, what I've been thinking aboutright now is at this point, the House of Representatives has passed ahealth care bill and has passed a strong financial reform bill. It haspassed a strong climate change bill. In any other advanced democracy,that would mean that all of these things would have happened. But inthe U.S. system, it takes 60 votes in the Senate to accomplish anythingand because the Democrats nominated somebody in Massachusetts who didn'tknow her Red Sox, that entire agenda has run aground -- incredible. WALTERS: That was his opponent. KRUGMAN: And it's important. Let me just say on health care, thatwas the most evasive answer. If you think this is a straightforwardguy, that was an incredibly evasive answer on health care because theSenate bill, which has now stalled, is identical to the Massachusettshealth care plan, the same thing. Only in the finest of fine print isthere any difference. He voted for the Massachusetts plan. A majorityof voters in Massachusetts who voted for him approve of theMassachusetts health care plan. Nonetheless, their plan is dead. WALTERS: And he's going to kill this. HUFFINGTON: But there were many symbolic things why his electionwas important. He's a manifestation of the mistrust of both politicalparties. He ran as an outsider. He ran as a Scott Brown Republican, ashe told you. Of course, that's selfish. He's already morphing into aconscious politician and both in his answer to health care and hisanswer to Don't Ask/Don't Tell, when he wouldn't tell you which way hewould go. So what is fascinating is to see really how much distrustthere is, the president called it the deficit of trust in his State ofUnion. And he really capitalized on that. And now when he comes toWashington, let's see how quickly he becomes an insider. This happenedto Obama. Remember he was a fresh face who was going to change thingsand the special interests have won, at least for round one. KRUGMAN: Can I say just one more thing? Voters still think they'revoting for individuals. They voted for Scott Brown because they feltthey liked Scott Brown, but in fact, they're voting for parties. Theonly thing that matters about a candidate right now is whether it's a""D"" or an ""R"" after his or her name. But voters haven't caught ontothat. And that's part of what just happened. WALTERS: That's why he's also saying, ""I'm a Scott Brown Republican."" KRUGMAN: But he is, he's a Republican Republican. AILES: That's partly true, but I think people are misinterpretingelections, I think President Obama misinterpreted his election. I thinkpeople could misinterpret this election, conservatives getting tooexcited about this guy being with them and I doubt he's really amoderate. People tend to misinterpret elections. The president broughtthat radical change to the United States as to what it was about, and itwas actually about we're tired of watching George Bush on television foreight years. He hasn't gotten the positive article in seven years andwe've got two wars on, it's time to fix it and I think that Obama ranvery carefully against George Bush and the beach was already softened upin those old World War II movies that the Navy goes in and softens upthe beach and then somebody comes along and lands. So I think that we tend to overinterpret these things. I think he'sa very soft-spoken, interesting guy. Let's see what he does. WILL: Let me respond a bit to Paul's disapproval of the 60-votesupermajority. The Republicans didn't invent it. The Democrats haveused it with great vigor, and will probably want to do so again when theRepublicans control the Senate. Yes, the Senate is different from the House. The founders plannedit that way. I know of nothing, Paul, that the American people have wantedintensely and protractedly that they didn't eventually get. What theSenate does is slow things down, and we have more to fear fromgovernment haste than from government tardiness. KRUGMAN: Well, I would say if you look at the charts, it's just nottrue. The filibuster has vastly increased in importance. It was notalways thus. What you think of as a time immemorial institution isactually something that came into existence only in the last 15 years orso. And it was never as intense as it is now. WILL: It came into existence in the '90s. WALTERS: We're going to come back, and we have much more time totalk about this, but we're going to have to pause. But before we do, inthe interest of full disclosure, that Cosmopolitan picture that you sawof Scott Brown, well, to my amazement, in the same issue, is... (UNKNOWN): Barbara Walters. There we go. WALTERS: But (inaudible) dressed. There we go. There we are. OK? So much for that. Now, when we come back, back to more serious subjects with all ofyou. We'll be right back. OBAMA: They didn't send us to Washington to fight each other insome sort of political steel cage match. (UNKNOWN): From your administration, there have come statementsthat Republicans have no ideas and no solutions. OBAMA: If you were to listen to the debate, you'd think that thisthing was some Bolshevik plot. (UNKNOWN): Will that new budget, like your old budget, triple thenational debt? OBAMA: It's very hard to have the kind of bipartisan work thatwe're going to do, because the whole question was structured as atalking point for running -- running a campaign. WALTERS: That was President Obama appearing before HouseRepublicans at their annual retreat on Friday, an unusually open andhonest back-and-forth, and we'll talk more about that with ourroundtable. George Will, Arianna Huffington, Paul Krugman, and RogerAiles, who is chairman and CEO of Fox News. Roger, just let me begin with you. You have had your ownback-and-forth with the White House. They were not very happy with you,banned you for a while. Have you kissed and made up? Is it hunky-dory? AILES: Well, they tried to ban us. They tried to break the pool,but the other networks stepped up and protected Fox on it, because itwas tortuous (ph) interference with a contractual relationship and sortof tramping around on the Constitution... WALTERS: But now you're OK. AILES: We're fine. I mean, we were -- it was not as bad as it wasplayed, and things are not as great (ph) as they should be, but we havea good dialogue. And I saw the president and his wife at the mediaChristmas party. They were very gracious, very nice, both of them. Andwe have a dialogue every day with them. WALTERS: Aw, shucks. It was more fun the other way. AILES: Well, I'll pick a fight if you want. I mean, I'll be happyto get into one. AILES: But I think there will be others. We have differences, but... HUFFINGTON: Well, Roger, it's not a question of picking a fight. And aren't you concerned about the language that Glenn Beck is using,which is, after all, inciting the American people? There is a lot ofsuffering out there, as you know, and when he talks about people beingslaughtered, about who is going to be the next in the killing spree... AILES: Well, he was talking about Hitler and Stalin slaughteringpeople. So I think he was probably accurate. Also, I'm a little.... HUFFINGTON: No, no, he was talking about this administration. AILES: I don't -- I think he speaks English. I don't know, but Imean, I don't misinterpret any of his words. He did say one unfortunatething, which he apologized for, but that happens in live television. SoI don't think it's -- I think if we start going around as the wordpolice in this business, it will be... HUFFINGTON: It's not about the word police. It's about somethingdeeper. It's about the fact that there is a tradition as the historianRichard Hofstetter said, in American politics, of the paranoid style. And the paranoid style is dangerous when there is real pain out there. I mean, with... AILES: I agree with you. I read something on your blog that said Ilooked like J. Edgar Hoover, I had a face like a fist, and I wasessentially a malignant tumor... HUFFINGTON: Well, that's... AILES: And I thought -- and then it got nasty after that... HUFFINGTON: ... that was never by anybody that we had... AILES: Then it really went nasty, and I thought, gee, maybe Ariannaought to cut this out, but... WALTERS: While we are talking about that, the president -- I'm justgoing to talk to you about this a little later, but this -- if -- thepresident has said in the state of the union and when he was talking tothe Republicans that there is a cynicism about the media, that he callsit slash and burn, and that we are to blame for a lot of the discontentand the rage in this country. Are you to blame? WILL: I don't think so. There is cynicism and there is rage, butthe vast swath of the American people are temperate, good-natured peoplewho aren't actually thinking about us in Washington as much as we wishthey were. But the president himself, when he gets up in front of theCongress and delivers a sermonette on the deficit of trust inWashington, should not, A, flagrantly mischaracterize the Supreme Courtdecision. I don't know whey he thought it was in his interest to pick afight with the most prestigious institution in Washington. He shouldnot in the same sermon on trust say he has proposed to freeze ongovernment spending when he has proposed a selective freeze on one-sixthof the federal budget. He should not say I'm all for expanding tradewith South Korea, Panama and Colombia when he won't move the existingagreements to ratify trade with them. So I don't think that when a man gets up and gives a speech full ofcognitive dissonance, saying Washington is corrupt, Washington isannoying (ph), Washington is tiresome, Washington is dysfunctional, andWashington should have a much bigger role in American life, I think that-- that breeds, you might say, a kind of distrust and cynicism. WALTERS: (inaudible) slash and burn.... KRUGMAN: If I can just -- you know, what bothers me is not thenasty language. Glenn Beck doesn't, you know, it's not -- what bothersme is the fact that people are not getting informed, that we are goingthrough major debates on crucial policy issues; the public is notlearning about them. And you know, you can say, well, they can read theNew York Times, which will tell them what they need to know, but youknow, most people don't. They don't read it thoroughly. They get -- onthis health care thing, I'm a little obsessed with it, because it's akey issue for me. People did not know what was in the plan, and some ofthat was just poor reporting, some of it was deliberate misinformation. I have here in front of me when President Obama said, you know, why --he said rhetorically, why aren't we going to do a health care plan likethe Europeans have, with a government-run program, and then proceeds toexplain whey he's different. On Fox News, what appeared was a clippedquote, ""why don't we have a European-style health care plan?"" Right,deliberate misinformation. All of that has contributed to a situation where the public... AILES: Wait a minute, wait a minute... KRUGMAN: I can show you the clip, and you can... AILES: The American people are not stupid... KRUGMAN: No, they're not stupid. They are uninformed. AILES: If you say -- if (inaudible) words are in the Constitution,if the founding fathers managed -- they didn't need 2,000 pages oflawyers to hide things, then tell, then tell... KRUGMAN: Oh, come on. Legislation always is long. AILES: ... then tell people it's an emergency that we get it, butit won't go into effect for three years. So you don't have time to readit, you... KRUGMAN: People, again, this was a plan that is -- it's actually aRepublican plan. It's Mitt Romney's health care plan. People were ledto believe that it was socialism. That's -- and that was deliberate. That wasn't just poor reporting. HUFFINGTON: There are two separate problems... AILES: Let me ask you a question, just as an example... HUFFINGTON: ... let me just answer that, because there is a problemin the fact that there wasn't a plan. There wasn't a plan that peoplecould understand. There were (inaudible) plans with a lot ofdifferences. But there is also a problem when it comes to the wordsbeing used. Words matter. And words that are actually being used bypeople we hire are different than the words that are being used bycommenters on our sites, like you mentioned. AILES: But there are 300 million people who have a health care planthat they are happy with. There are about 30 million people who don'thave a health care plan. So as an executive, what do you do? You gofix the 30 million. You don't go over here and upset the apple cart for300 million... KRUGMAN: Which is exactly what the plan was. KRUGMAN: It was trying (ph) to leave the employer-based health care... AILES: ... $500 billion away from old people. WALTERS: OK, let me ask you, because (inaudible). Is the healthplan that took the president 34 minutes to get to the issue he spent allhis past year on, he says he's not giving up on health care. Is it dead? WILL: Well, Chuck Schumer, who is a legitimate representative ofthe mainstream of the Democratic caucus in the Senate, says his threepriorities, and the Democratic Party's three priorities this year, arejobs, jobs and jobs. Rahm Emanuel, who is not always quoted accurately,is quoted, however, as saying top three priorities are jobs, deficitreduction, and financial regulation. What don't we hear? We don't hearhealth care. KRUGMAN: It couldn't have been. I mean, remember, both houses ofCongress have passed quite similar health care plans. There are ways tomake this thing happen. We know there's a legislative strategy, but itdoesn't work unless Obama gets behind it. In the 10 days after theMassachusetts election were totally disheartening. That was the momentwhen we needed some leadership from Obama and he just seemed to wander off. KRUGMAN: You know, it's just possible, not completely dead. Itcould be saved if the president wakes up. If just possibly Nancy Pelosiand Harry Reid can make a way for this to happen, but it's not very likely. HUFFINGTON: The only way it can be saved is if the Democrats decideto follow Senator Harkin with his reconciliation sidecar. That's theonly way this could be saved. But to George's point, they're all sayingit's jobs, jobs, jobs. But when it comes to the State of the Union, theprofessors are not serious in terms of dealing with the jobs crisis. Imean, all this little initiatives a la Bill Clinton in the '90s are notgoing to work because this is not the '90s. This is a 17.5 percent realunemployment. WALTERS: Small business hiring someone new, and the tax cuts... KRUGMAN: ... that is a good plan, but it is a $30 billion plan andmight create a couple hundred thousand jobs in the situation. We have a8 million, 10 million job deficit. It is a very small plan. It is amicro-policy. WILL: It's also easily gamed, as you know by people will hirepeople they wouldn't hire otherwise and get rid of them as soon as thetax credit is gone. HUFFINGTON: But most important, people have not really focused onthe crisis on the middle class. When Lehman Brothers collapsed,everybody focused and they did unprecedented things. The middle classis in real trouble. I mean, if you look at the latest Brookings reportabout the rise of poverty in the suburb, about the fact now that we haveone in eight people whose mortgages are under water, who can't pay theircredit card bills, this is a major, major problem that theadministration is not seriously addressing it. WALTERS: Let me ask you something, Roger, because when you workedfor President Nixon, you helped to get him in the White House. You'recredited for doing that. AILES: Well, I was a television producer, not a politician, butyes. The back light was in the right place. WALTERS: What advice would you give to Barack Obama? AILES: I think he's in a very tough spot. He is enormously likableand I think despite what everybody says, people would like him tosucceed. But he came in with the belief that the radical change hewanted or what some people say is a radical change that he wanted wouldbe widely accepted. WALTERS: But give him some advice, boom, boom, boom now. AILES: The first advice I'd give him is listen to everybody andthen go in a dark room by yourself, because in the end, it's all goingto happen in your brain. If you actually believe all these things thatyou're for, and Richard Neustadt in ""Presidential Power"" explains thatthe only real presidential power is the power to persuade the people, tobe open, to go out to them and say this is the reason I believe this,this is the direction I believe the American people should go. If hedoesn't do that and I don't think he can sell some of his programs. Ithink he has to become president of all the people and I think he's gotto go to transparency and I think you'd be surprised. People who arewilling to give him the benefit of the doubt, but you can't do this inback rooms surrounded entirely by political consultants. HUFFINGTON: Can I give him some advice too? He should go back andlisten to his speeches during the campaign because in Denver, he saidthe greatest risk we can take is to play the same game, surrounded bythe people, and he's doing that. Surrounded by Larry Summers and TimGeithner and the same people who basically were part of the ... HUFFINGTON: Definitely Geithner should be out and ... KRUGMAN: I don't think Tim Geithner is the problem. The problem isthat Tim Geithner, going back to something earlier, he and the presidentare soul mates. They both have the view of essentially incrementalisttinkering of the edges and Obama needs to have a view that he's reallygoing to take on. I think financial reform could be an issue where hecan recapture some of the sense of being an outsider, some of the senseof running against business as usual. The Republicans will make thateasy for him because they are going to be dead set against any kind offinancial reform. They will vote not a single vote for any realisticcurbs on Wall Street. But he has to find that fire in himself. It'snot a question of replacing Tim Geithner, it's a question of replacinghis own tendency to think well, you know, let's just stabilize things alittle bit. WALTERS: What about the freeze, the fear of freeze and the $20billion in budget cuts? Is that going to work? KRUGMAN: It's junk fiscal policy, it is junk economics. We allknow that. KRUGMAN: It's not all that important. It's 15 percent of thefederal budget. It's -- the Center for American Progress, which is athink tank that is very closely tied to the administration, one weekbefore the State of the Union had an article about how you can tellpeople who are phony deficit hawks, what they call deficit peacocks. And they advocate things like a freeze on non-defense discretionaryspending... HUFFINGTON: And they called him a deficit peacock. KRUGMAN: And they called the president -- no, it's pure stuntmaking, and worse, it's a Republican talking point. It's a Republican... HUFFINGTON: Actually, it's one point on which everybody agrees. Ijust came back from Davos, and everybody, including Niall Ferguson, whodoesn't agree with Paul on anything, called it a joke. I mean, andtalking about breeding cynicism -- it's these kind of measures thatbreed cynicism, that make people feel that politicians are just readingfocus group tests and acting on them. WILL: Paul has been consistent, here and elsewhere, for manymonths, saying the big danger is 1937, when we got a recession within adepression, because in Paul's judgment and some others, the governmentflinched, that it declared victory prematurely. Now, Paul would like a bigger, better stimulus program. Paul'sadministration won't even use the S word, stimulus is so out of favor. KRUGMAN: There's only so much politically that Obama can do tocreate jobs, because he doesn't have a political capital now. This is,you know, early on in the administration, I was frantic, saying, youhave to go big, because you are going to get one shot at this, and theydidn't. And so that's -- that is where we are now. But now to buy into the notion that we're going to start reducingthe deficit when the unemployment rate is still at 10 percent, is a verybad thing. AILES: Jobs is the second issue, in my view. WALTERS: What's the first? AILES: Safety and sovereignty of the United States, and I thinkpeople, when they see a guy get all the way over Detroit to (inaudible)his underpants, but he could have, and now we're in a situation wherewe're going to have to either -- we took everybody's shoes off; nowwe're going to have to take everybody's underpants off. But the factis, that's not going to stop. We've got to get much tougher. We've cutthe hands off the CIA. We can't -- it's the Norwegians that are doingthis. We know who it is. We can't seem to say it. So sooner or later,we're going to have to toughen up on all this stuff. And the Americanpeople know it, they feel it, and they're worried about it. WALTERS: Let me just go around for our last moments. The state ofthe union. Did the president -- people seemed to think in general thatit was a good speech. Did he get his footing back? Did it make adifference? Yes, no? WILL: State of the union addresses rarely make a great difference. They have a captive audience, but the audience is usually unmoved. HUFFINGTON: They focus-group tested it within an inch of its life. You know, there was an applause line for every constituency, and hisgrand vision, which got him elected, was really missing. As the NewYork Times call it, it's the opposite of bold. KRUGMAN: The give-and-take with the Republicans was what the stateof the union should have been. That was where... WALTERS: Did that make a big difference? KRUGMAN: It made some difference. The president said that theRepublicans of the party have no ideas, and they demonstrated it on thespot, that they are in fact the party of no ideas. That's where heneeds to go. WALTERS: What do you think? AILES: I thought he did a pretty good job of delivering hisspeech. He seemed to get a little bit of his energy back. He'd fallenaway over the last few months. You know, he did some dumb things, liketake on the Supreme Court. But the media saved him and blamed it all onAlito. But you know, that speech, he's got to follow it up with his --look, there is an easy way to get it done. I went to the White Houseone night because I had to meet with Ronald Reagan. And there was a lotof laughter down at the end of the hallway. I waited about 10 minutes,and out came Reagan and Tip O'Neill, arm in arm, with a drink in theirhand, telling Irish jokes. In the paper the next day, they kind oftrashed each other's ideas, but they obviously cut some kind of a deal. And that's, you know, there are ways. If he wants to invite the fourRepublicans and four Democrats over to the Super Bowl and say, come on,guys, we've got to get some jobs... HUFFINGTON: He tried to do that. He wasted three months... AILES: No, that's the way it gets done. HUFFINGTON: He wasted three months trying to get Chuck Grassley toagree to what Max Baucus was trying to do. So he's tried that again andagain and again. AILES: He's tried to get Republicans to agree with him, there's noquestion. And the media will report that -- what they say is aRepublican is evolving, as if he's a caveman if he leans towards thepresident on something. WILL: In Baltimore, at the meeting that Paul liked, the presidentsaid ""I read your bills."" To most Americans, it was news that theRepublicans had bills. But in fact, he got engaged in a dialogue withPaul Ryan of Wisconsin. If he'd met Paul Ryan halfway, you'd havehealth care soon. WALTERS: I just want to ask, in the few seconds we have left, SarahPalin is now on your payroll. OK? 2012, presidential candidate? AILES: I have no -- no idea, no idea whether she even wants to. Idon't think she -- she knows. I mean, everybody hates her who's everwritten a book because they didn't sell many. She wrote a book and itsold two million in two weeks, and so now they hate her, they have a newreason to hate her. I don't know... WALTERS: But you hired her to be a commentator. Do you think -- soyou must think she has some qualifications? She seems to be verypopular with certain groups. Do you think she has the qualifications tobe president? AILES: FOX News is fair and balanced. We had Geraldine Ferraro onfor 10 years as the only woman the Democrats ever nominated. Now wehave the only woman that the Republicans nominated. I'm not inpolitics, I'm in ratings. We're willing. HUFFINGTON: Roger, you clearly are in ratings, but if you are inratings, can you explain to me why FOX went away from the meeting thepresident was having in -- why did you go away, 20 minutes before the end? AILES: Because we're the most trusted name in news. HUFFINGTON: OK and on that note... WALTERS: I thought we were the most trusted name in news. AILES: And we believe two liberal polls have now proven it. WALTERS: I've got to go. The Roundtable, as you've been listeningto, continues in the green room and ABCNews.com.

Gardner Selby on Wednesday, July 23rd, 2014 at 4:58 p.m.Texas Gov. Rick Perry expressed concern about border-crossing immigrants committing crimes, going on to tell Glenn Beck in a July 17, 2014, interview ""the number of illegal activities up to and including homicides--I think over 3,000 homicides by illegal aliens over the course of the last six years; that’s unacceptable and that’s the reason that we have to secure that border.""That sounded like a lot of killings by unauthorized residents. (Where were those headlines?)Perry's backupWe decided to put Perry's number to the Texas Truth-O-Meter, starting with Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed, who told us to consult the Texas Department of Public Safety.DPS Director Steve McCraw referred to that many homicides in his July 3, 2014, testimony to the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security. After saying the ""consequences of an unsecured border with Mexico"" undermine public safety, McCraw said: ""Another consequence seldom discussed is the high number of criminal aliens arrested for non-immigration crimes throughout Texas."" He then mentioned ""over 3,000 homicides"" since 2008.Asked for elaboration, a DPS spokesman, Tom Vinger, pointed to an agency web page, "" Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data,"" stating that since January 2012, a monthly average of 5,899 ""foreign nationals"" -- individuals legally authorized to live in the U.S. or not -- have been arrested in Texas, with 40 percent having been arrested before on a criminal charge.Also on the page: ""From October 2008 through July 1, 2014, Texas has identified a total of 203,685 unique criminal alien defendants booked into Texas county jails. Over their criminal careers, these defendants are responsible for at least 642,564 individual criminal charges mostly consisting of Class B misdemeanors or higher, including 3,070 homicides and 7,964 sexual assaults,"" the agency says.The web page includes a pie chart tallying the criminal charges accumulated by the defendants:Source: Web page, "" Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data,"" Texas Department of Public Safety (accessed July 21, 2014)The last line on the page says ""these are minimum figures as these numbers include only those aliens whose fingerprints were already in the federal system when they were booked and it does not necessarily include all those who are incarcerated in federal prison.""We asked Vinger for more detail about the homicide charges. We especially wondered how many charges had been leveled since the flow of children crossing the border started to escalate in 2011.Vinger replied by email, ""We don’t have any additional information.""Outside criminologistsNext, we explored whether Perry accurately cited the DPS information.To rehash, the governor told Beck more than 3,000 homicides had been committed by ""illegal aliens"" since 2008. However, the DPS web page doesn’t say that; it doesn’t even specify when (or where) the 3,070 homicide charges in the criminal histories of all the ""alien"" individuals arrested in Texas since October 2008 accumulated.Via the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, we reached criminologists who looked over the DPS presentation.Michael Walker, an adjunct John Jay professor and an expert in how the FBI gathers crime statistics, said the DPS information doesn’t demonstrate the 3,000-plus homicides were committed by any residents since 2008. Rather, Walker said by phone, the presentation telescoped the arrest histories of the 203,685 individuals put in county jails in the 69 months that were reviewed. ""Where did they offend--Texas? Oklahoma? Mississippi?"" Walker said, his point being such information isn’t on the web page.Walker and Ramiro Martinez, Jr., a Northeastern University professor, each suggested it’s highly unlikely unauthorized residents committed that many homicides in the years mentioned by Perry.Drawing on FBI Uniform Crime Statistics for Texas posted online by the DPS, Walker calculated that from 2008 through 2012, there were 3,903 persons arrested on homicide charges in the state. Walker said it’s not logical that residents in the state without legal permission accounted for most of the same deaths. He conceded, too, he wasn’t able to roll in homicide charges from 2013 and 2014; he didn’t see that data online nor were we successful in eliciting figures from DPS.Martinez offered up his own analysis, which started by averaging the FBI’s tally of a little more than 1,100 homicides in Texas in 2011 and 2012 and extrapolating that over six years to reach an estimated total of nearly 6,700 homicides over most of the period analyzed by DPS. By email, Martinez said Perry’s statement to Beck potentially would suggest 3,070, or 46 percent, of the estimated homicides were committed by ""illegal aliens."" But, he said, ""that makes no sense."" He said in a follow-up email: ""It just boggles the imagination that level of ‘aliens’ were involved to that extent over time and nobody noticed.""The criminologists noted another weakness; the DPS presentation mixes together recent homicide charges with those that might have been leveled decades ago. Also, they noted, the agency tallied arrests only, not homicide convictions.Martinez also raised an eyebrow at the mingling of criminal charges against legally authorized U.S. residents and individuals in the country without permission, risking conclusions irrelevant to border security today. By the state's approach, he said, it’s possible a homicide charge in the tally involves someone who reached the U.S. from Cuba in 1962 who was later charged with and/or committed a homicide. If so, he said, that charge would bear no relevance to criminal actions by people lately crossing the Rio Grande.Neither the DPS or Perry’s office offered more information.Our rulingPerry told Beck over 3,000 homicides were committed ""by illegal aliens over the"" last six years.This claim is unsupported by the presentation he relied on, which indicates that since 2008 in Texas, more than 200,000 arrested immigrants -- foreign nationals living here with or without legal permission -- had among them accumulated 3,070 homicide charges (not convictions) in their lives. Put another way, for this declaration to hold water, one would have to assume illegal immigrants committed nearly half of the state’s homicides since 2008; we found no such data.This statement is both incorrect and ridiculous.

Highlighted excerpts are below, and a full transcript is after the jump. LEW: You know, I have to tell you, as somebody who’s done budgets for a lot of years, usually when people say to me that something doesn’t cost money, I ask them, how could that be? This is the exception to the rule. If you priced two insurance plans, one of them with contraception and other without, the plan without contraception costs more than the one with it. So this will not cost the insurance companies money. It will not put religious institutions in a position (ph) where they have to violate their principles. CROWLEY: Why won’t it? Why — why is that? … CROWLEY: As far as the White House is concerned, is this done? LEW: … put out a pretty solid plan. CROWLEY: So no more compromising? LEW: We’ve put out the plan that reflects where the president intended to go. CROWLEY: So that means there is room for compromising or is not? LEW: No. This is our plan. LEW: I believe it should get solved. And I know there are people working hard even this weekend trying to solve it. CROWLEY: What are you doing — I mean, as far as the administration is concerned, is it all right for the Egyptian government to be holding these Americans inside the country? LEW: Well, let’s be clear. The situation in Egypt is quite serious. We have made clear we’re having conversations — General Dempsey is there this weekend — that it’s important to resolve this country to country. But to compare this to the Iranian hostage crisis really does a disservice to those Americans in Iran who truly were held hostage. This is a situation that can be resolved. There’s time to resolve it. And our government is working very hard. CROWLEY: Are you close to getting them out of the country? LEW: I don’t want to speak to where things are going, but all efforts are being made. LEW: Unless Republicans are willing to work with Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reid is not going to be able to get a budget passed. And I think he was reflecting the reality that that could be a challenge. But let’s be clear. There’s time and the desire to work together. You know, we’ve put a lot of things out there, ranging from authority to reorganize the government so that we have a government that’s the 21st century, not the 19th and the 20th century, home financing proposals so that Americans, Republicans and Democrats alike, can refinance homes that are underwater. CROWLEY: What’s the economy going to look like in September? What will the unemployment rate be? LEW: You know, we’ve been very heartened by the economic news of the last two, three months…. I can’t predict that each month will be as good as the last few, but we’re certainly headed in the right direction. What we need to make sure is that we don’t do anything to get in the way. Washington needs to get its work done. That’s why the payroll tax needs to be extended on time without a lot of drama. It’s why we need to do our business in a way that doesn’t create the kind of uncertainty that did harm to the economy over the summer. THIS IS A RUSH FDCH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CROWLEY: Joining me here in Washington, White House chief of staff Jacob Lew. Thanks for joining us. LEW: Good to be with you this morning. CROWLEY: I want to start out with what has roiled certainly some in the Catholic community, I know has really set (ph) the White House off in trying to get things situated, and that is this idea that Catholic universities, Catholic hospitals should have to pay for contraception for its employees as part of the health care plan. The president comes back with a compromise and says, well, the health care insurance will contact the women in these facilities and offer contraceptive services, and the women can accept or not accept, and the health care — the health care provider, Aetna, whatever, will pay for it. Is that where we are right now? LEW: Well, let me actually tell you where we are, Candy. The president’s had a consistent position throughout this. He has two principles that are very important. One is that all women have a right to all forms of (inaudible) health care, including contraception. Secondly, in the greatest tradition of this country, we have to respect the religious liberties of people with very different views. I think where this policy has come out is that the initial announcement of the policy said it would take some time to work through the details. Because of the concern that arose, we speeded up the process. And on Friday, what the president announced was we think a very good resolution of the problem. It’s gotten the support of a wide range of organizations, from Catholic charities and the Catholic Health Association to Planned Parenthood. It respects both of these core principles, and we think it’s a good solution. CROWLEY: Well, let me — it did not win the support of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which put out a statement Friday and said today’s proposal, being the compromise proposal, continues to involve needless government intrusion in the internal governance of religious institutions and to threaten government coercion of religious people and groups to violate their most deeply held convictions. You’re an observant Jew, I know. Was there anything about this that made you think twice when it first went out? LEW: No, you know, I have to say that the solution that we came up with puts no religious institution in a position where it either has to pay for or facilitate the provision of benefits they find objectionable. If the issue is, should women have access to all forms of preventive care, including contraception? We believe the answer to that is yes. CROWLEY: Can you say, though, with a straight face that the insurance company is going to pick up the cost of this? LEW: You know, I have to tell you, as somebody who’s done budgets for a lot of years, usually when people say to me that something doesn’t cost money, I ask them, how could that be? This is the exception to the rule. If you priced two insurance plans, one of them with contraception and other without, the plan without contraception costs more than the one with it. So this will not cost the insurance companies money. It will not put religious institutions in a position (ph) where they have to violate their principles. CROWLEY: Why won’t it? Why — why is that? LEW: Because the total cost of care for persons is higher without than it is with contraception. CROWLEY: Then why isn’t — why don’t health insurance companies everywhere just offer free contraceptive services? LEW: I actually think there won’t be as much resistance to this from insurance companies as people might think because of what I just said. If you look to examples in other states where it’s worked (ph), it’s worked pretty much the way I’ve described. There is an issue here. The issue is, do women have a right to contraception? And we think the answer is yes. Should religious institutions have their sensibilities protected? The answer is yes. You know, I am a person of faith. I care deeply that we’re a country that respects faith and that respects people’s rights to have different views. This was a challenge to reconcile two important principles, and the president found a way to reconcile those. There are others who don’t have the same objective, and they have to speak for themselves. CROWLEY: As far as the White House is concerned, is this done? LEW: … put out a pretty solid plan. CROWLEY: So no more compromising? LEW: We’ve put out the plan that reflects where the president intended to go. CROWLEY: So that means there is room for compromising or is not? LEW: No. This is our plan. CROWLEY: OK. Let me move you on to the payroll tax cut. We’re coming up to the end of the month. How certain are you that Congress is going to pass a year-long extension of this payroll tax cut and the other things that come with it, the doc fix and unemployment insurance? LEW: You know, I think that it’s clear that the economy is doing much better, but it needs to have that additional push that comes from this payroll tax. We saw in December that it didn’t work out so well to have a big, ugly fight over the payroll tax. We can avoid that. We have enough time for Congress to get its work done. You know, we all care about having the economic growth and having unemployment go down and employment go up. This payroll tax is important. There are — this can be solved. Congress needs to gets its work done. LEW: I believe it should get solved. And I know there are people working hard even this weekend trying to solve it. CROWLEY: Let me show you a recent ABC News poll about the president’s handling of the federal budget deficit, and we will get to the budget, which we know is coming out tomorrow, in a bit. But I want to ask you in general. This poll shows that 38 percent of Americans approve of the way the president’s handling the deficit, and 58 percent disapprove. Why is that, do you think? LEW: You know, we’ve just come through one of the worst economic periods in modern history. When the president took office, we were losing jobs at a rate of 750,000 a month. We’re now at a point where we’re gaining jobs at a rate of 250,000 a month, so it’s a swing of a million jobs from when we took office to now. CROWLEY: (inaudible) deficits specifically. LEW: In order to get to the point where we are, it has required us to do things that you wouldn’t have done under other circumstances. So the Recovery Act that did involve some spending, having federal programs that automatically kick in. Revenues were down because economic growth was lower. We share the concerns of the American people that we need to focus on the deficit, and we’ll talk about the president’s budget, which does $4 trillion of deficit reduction in a fair, balanced way, that asks everybody to do their fair share. So we have a plan. But it’s not surprising to me that the American people are looking at the deficit today and saying they’d like some action now. LEW: Yeah, we — we agree with them. CROWLEY: Let me — before we get to that — and it’ll be after the break — let me ask you about Egypt. Newt Gingrich said in a recent speech that there are Americans being held hostage in America. We do know there are Americans are not being allowed to leave, because the Egyptian military government has said it may want to prosecute them. He compared it to the Iranian hostage crisis. What are you doing — I mean, as far as the administration is concerned, is it all right for the Egyptian government to be holding these Americans inside the country? LEW: Well, let’s be clear. The situation in Egypt is quite serious. We have made clear we’re having conversations — General Dempsey is there this weekend — that it’s important to resolve this country to country. But to compare this to the Iranian hostage crisis really does a disservice to those Americans in Iran who truly were held hostage. This is a situation that can be resolved. There’s time to resolve it. And our government is working very hard. CROWLEY: Are you close to getting them out of the country? LEW: I don’t want to speak to where things are going, but all efforts are being made. CROWLEY: OK. Coming up, more with White House chief of staff Jacob Lew. And later, Rick Santorum got a rousing reception at CPAC, but lost the conservative straw poll vote to Mitt Romney. We’ll ask him why. CROWLEY: We are back with White House chief of staff Jacob Lew. I want to put up for our viewers what we know about some of the things that are coming out of this — the president’s budget plan tomorrow, and that is $350 billion in short-term jobs spending, $476 billion in spending on infrastructure, $60 billion for schools and retaining teachers, first responders. We just got finished talking about the deficit, and we saw the low numbers of the approval numbers for the president on dealing with the federal deficit. This looks like another stimulus plan. LEW: Well, this is a budget that takes both a short- and a long-term view. I think that there’s broad agreement from all of the commissions that were out doing work on the budget to most budget experts that, over this next period of time, we still need to pay attention to sustaining economic growth and creating jobs. That’s why it’s so important to pass the payroll tax before the end of February. It’s why it’s so important that we jump-start our investment in infrastructure. LEW: This is a budget that takes a look at the short and the long term. Over the long term, there’s $4 trillion of deficit reduction in this budget. It comes by adhering to the rules that were part of the budget agreement last year, which was $1 trillion of savings in the annual appropriation. It has another $1 trillion of savings that were part of the August debt agreement. And then there’s $2 trillion of additional savings on top of that. This comes from very tough policies in almost every area, from mandatory programs to revenues. CROWLEY: It also comes from more spending, some of this funding. LEW: The savings come from the tough decisions. The savings come from having a policy that’s based on the principles that the president outlined in Kansas and that he outlined in the State of the Union. CROWLEY: What’s the toughest cut (ph) of the whole thing? CROWLEY: Do you think that sounds like a tough cut, you know consolidating agriculture departments? LEW: I think that when you look at $1 trillion of savings over 10 years, that’s a lot of money; $1 trillion doesn’t have to come by — you know, we have to make sure that as we make these reductions, we do it in a smart way. So we cut some things, and we increase other things. So, for example, while we’re cutting the things that we can do without, we’re increasing what we put in over this period of time into research and development, so we can build the economy of the future and make sure that we have an economy that can last. CROWLEY: Do you think it looks like a stimulus plan? LEW: I think most Americans understand that a crumbling infrastructure is not the way to build an economy that can last. You know, we need to make sure that we have a manufacturing base in this country. We need to make sure that we have American workers with the skills for the jobs of the future. We need to make sure that we have an energy policy that will leave us in a place where we can generate our own energy and also not be dependent on overseas (ph). And we also need to have a policy that’s true to American values, and that means that everyone has to pay their fair share and have a fair shot. CROWLEY: I know we’ll want to talk about the tax hikes in a second, but I want to read for our viewers something that Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader in the U.S. Senate, who said, we do not need to bring a budget to the floor this year. It’s done. We don’t need to do it, talking about last year’s two-year agreement and saying that, you know, so it’s already done. This budget, I can assure you and you know, because you’ve been in this town for a long time, is going to be attacked as a political document. This is a budget that promises 2 million more jobs if it’s passed, so that come September the president can go out there and say, well, if they’d only passed by budget, we’d have 2 million more jobs, but those darn Republicans are standing in my way, when, in fact, even the Democratic leader in the Senate says, you know what, we don’t need a budget. LEW: Well, let’s be clear. What Senator Reid is talking about is a fairly narrow point. In order for the Senate to do its annual work on appropriation bills, they need to pass a certain piece of legislation which sets a limit. They did that last year. That’s what he’s talking about. He’s not saying that they shouldn’t pass a budget. But we also need to be honest. You can’t pass a budget in the Senate of the United States without 60 votes, and you can’t get 60 votes without bipartisan support. LEW: Unless Republicans are willing to work with Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reid is not going to be able to get a budget passed. And I think he was reflecting the reality that that could be a challenge. But let’s be clear. There’s time and the desire to work together. You know, we’ve put a lot of things out there, ranging from authority to reorganize the government so that we have a government that’s the 21st century, not the 19th and the 20th century, home financing proposals so that Americans, Republicans and Democrats alike, can refinance homes that are underwater. There’s a lot that we can and should do together on a bipartisan basis this year (ph). CROWLEY: Last question. What’s the economy going to look like in September? What will the unemployment rate be? LEW: You know, we’ve been very heartened by the economic news of the last two, three months. CROWLEY: (inaudible) keep falling? LEW: … that unemployment has been falling. Job growth is strong. CROWLEY: Do you think it will continue to fall and be lower in September than it is now? LEW: I can’t predict that each month will be as good as the last few, but we’re certainly headed in the right direction. What we need to make sure is that we don’t do anything to get in the way. Washington needs to get its work done. That’s why the payroll tax needs to be extended on time without a lot of drama. It’s why we need to do our business in a way that doesn’t create the kind of uncertainty that did harm to the economy over the summer.

(END VIDEO CLIP)ANNOUNCER: From the heart of the nation's capital, ""This Week"" withABC's senior White House correspondent, Jake Tapper, live from theNewseum on Pennsylvania Avenue. TAPPER: And joining me now is House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer andHouse Minority Leader John Boehner. Gentlemen, thanks so much forjoining me. HOYER: Thank you. BOEHNER: Hey, good morning. TAPPER: So you got a letter last night -- I actually think I got itbefore you guys did... HOYER: I think you did. TAPPER: ... but from President Obama requesting $50 billion inemergency spending for state and local governments. Leader Hoyer, youhave said that there is spending fatigue on Capitol Hill. Can you getthis passed? HOYER: Well, I think it's accurate that there's spending fatigue,not only on Capitol Hill, but around the country. People are concernedabout the debt level, and we are, as well. But clearly, you cannot notcontinue to stimulate an economy that is still struggling to get out ofthe deep ditch that we found it in about 18 months ago. What the president is saying is, we need to expend additionaldollars to make sure that we don't have significant layoffs in the nextfew months, which will again depress the economy, so that -- Iunderstand what he's saying. I have asked the White House to look atthe package that we -- the Recovery and Reinvestment Act that we passed,approximately $800-plus billion. There are clearly funds in there thathave not been expended to see whether or not there are some availablefor this more immediate priority than some that may not be quite asimmediate. TAPPER: Leader Boehner, the president said in his letter that ifthis does not pass, the economy -- there's a risk that the economy willslide back into recession. Do you agree? BOEHNER: Listen, I'm concerned about the plight of teachers,firemen, policemen who face the real possibility that they may be laidoff, but to send this letter up here on a Saturday night with noopportunity to cut spending elsewhere in the budget strikes me as alittle different. Steny and I and other leaders were at the White Houseon Thursday, and this subject never came up. There was no indication this was going to happen. And I'm askingmyself, why is this happening on Saturday night? Fact is that the spending spree in Washington is continuing to rununabated. The American people are screaming at the top of their lungs,""Stop!"" And -- and to move this without finding other offsets inspending, I think, is irresponsible. It's just putting more debt on thebacks of our kids and our grandkids, and it really begs the question is,why don't we have a budget this year? You know, we've not cut -- the House has failed -- not failed in themodern era to move a budget. And this appears to be the first time inthe modern era that the House is not even going to consider a budget. TAPPER: Well, Leader Hoyer, if I could... (CROSSTALK)TAPPER: ... if I could say, one of the -- the theory is that youdon't want to make vulnerable Democrats vote for another spending bill,and that's why for the first time since 1974 there isn't going to be aHouse budget. Is that not true? HOYER: Whatever -- whatever the theory may be, Jake, the fact ofthe matter is, my friend, Mr. Boehner, voted for $2 trillion during theBush administration of unfunded spending. So when he says this cascadeof spending, he... (CROSSTALK)TAPPER: But you agree that this should be offset with spending cuts? HOYER: I would hope that we could do that, yes. However, what Isaid was, money that has already been appropriated in the Recovery andReinvestment Act that has not yet been spent could be spent now on thesepriority items. Nobody wants to see $300,000 teachers or fire andpolice laid off. That's not good for the economy; it's not good for ourkids; it's not good for the safety of our communities. So the president's absolutely right in terms of this beingcritically important spending, and we're going to work on getting that. I personally believe that if we have dollars that are not yet expendedin the Recovery Act that we can apply to this immediate need and thenlook to later expenditures in the long term for investments, I think weought to do that. But we can't -- we can't stimulate and depress at thesame time. TAPPER: I'd like to -- I'd... BOEHNER: Jake, every family knows that in a tough time it's moreimportant to have a budget, not less. And if you think that they'regoing to move a budget on Capitol Hill, you must obviously believe thatElvis is still alive. TAPPER: Well, I'd -- I'd like to move on to another topic... HOYER: I know you do... TAPPER: ... other than Elvis. HOYER: ... but as you know, the Republicans didn't have a budget in'02, '04, '06. BOEHNER: The House has never failed to pass a budget in the modern era. HOYER: And the American public had no idea about that, budgets thatpass... BOEHNER: Well, this is a great opportunity... HOYER: ... and spending bills that follow (ph). BOEHNER: ... to cut spending and to get the economy going again. HOYER: And we're doing that. BOEHNER: That's why I gave the president... HOYER: Let me close with this. BOEHNER: ... a letter this week with -- 100 economists signed aletter saying that cutting spending now will, in fact, help get theeconomy moving again, get jobs back... (CROSSTALK)TAPPER: I would like -- in terms of getting things moving again, Iwould like to move to another topic... HOYER: Look, can I conclude on the deficit? Because the president-- we've adopted statutory PAYGO, which they jettisoned. BOEHNER: And you've ignored it every time you've had a chance touse it. TAPPER: All right, guys... HOYER: The president sent down a freeze in spending. And heestablished a commission to look at long-term spending control. All ofthat is positive movement. TAPPER: Let's move on to the oil spill. BOEHNER: The American people want spending cut now. TAPPER: Got it. Let's move on to the oil spill, because I want toget your reaction. On Tuesday, the BP chief operating officer, DougSuttles, told the Associated Press that the flow ""should decrease to arelative trickle by Monday or Tuesday."" That's by tomorrow or the dayafter that, Doug Suttles said that. I don't know what a relative anything means when it comes to thisoil spill, but there's no indication that there's going to be -- it'sonly going to be trickling by tomorrow or the next day. And I just wantto know, as the leaders of your respective parties on Capitol Hill, areyou finding it tough to believe anything these guys from BP have to sayanymore? HOYER: Certainly BP has not been accurate in its representations. It has been misleading in its representations. What has happened isoutrageous, and the American public are correctly very, very angry. Andthe administration has been marshalling every asset that we haveavailable to work on this program. I hope he's right. The American public hopes he's right. Atrickle. I don't know what a trickle is. But certainly a very, verysubstantial reduction. BP said they could handle a 250,000-barrelspill. They have -- weren't able to handle what they said was initiallya 5,000, which was -- what then went to 20,000 or 25,000 and now wethink is a much greater spill than that. BOEHNER: Well, Steny, guess what? I agree wholeheartedly withyou. The American people want this oil leak stopped now. They want toknow what happened. They want the gulf cleaned up. And they want itall done now. And I just think that BP ought to be held responsible for all of thecosts that are involved in this. I've said that right from -- from thebeginning. And I continue to believe that. I'm sure that the federal government, though, was -- isn't alsoresponsible. The laws that were in place, the -- the materials thatshould have been in place for a spill this size were not, and thereaction, I think, on the part of the administration has been slow. Buthaving said that, it's time to get this thing stopped now. TAPPER: All right, just to... HOYER: The only thing I would say to that, Jake... TAPPER: ... just to clear up what you said earlier this week, onThursday, you said that -- that BP and the federal government shouldtake full responsibility. To clarify that, you think BP needs to pay? BOEHNER: I've said from the beginning, BP needs to pay for theentire cost of this. But the federal government -- this is a failure ofgovernment. Government is there to protect our shores, to protect ourenvironment. And there's been a real failure here. We've been asking for 55 days, where's the inspection reports fromthis rig? The administration won't give them to us. TAPPER: The Democrats are pushing a bill to lift the liability. Right now, it's at $75 million. Democrats are pushing a bill to liftthe liability cap. Do you support that? BOEHNER: I believe that lifting the liability cap on BP and forthis spill is appropriate. I have concerns... TAPPER: So lift it entirely for BP? BOEHNER: Absolutely. They should be held responsible for everydime of this cost. HOYER: Let me -- let me -- let me say a few words here. First ofall, the Republicans have been holding up lifting the cap in the Senatefrom the $75 million, minuscule sum, as we see, to $10 billion. Secondly, I think John Boehner is right in this respect: Thepsychology of neglect in terms of regulatory oversight that was pursuedin the Bush administration, which led to the banking failure, insuranceprices going way up, and oil companies thinking they could do whateverthey wanted because the ""drill, baby, drill"" crowd, all they wanted themto do was to drill. So I think John's right. I think the regularly psychology of thelast administration was not appropriate, and there was mistakes made inthis administration, as well. BOEHNER: How long are you going to blame the Bush administration? Come on. What's going on over at MSS... HOYER: As long as they're responsible, whether it's the economy... BOEHNER: No, that's -- listen... HOYER: ... or their lack of oversight, John, I'm going to do that. BOEHNER: Where -- where -- when is someone... HOYER: As appropriate (ph). BOEHNER: ... in Washington going to -- Washington going to takeresponsibility for what they are in charge of? TAPPER: I want to move on... HOYER: And the administration has done that. TAPPER: I want to move on to some foreign policy questions, butbefore I do, I just -- there -- there was a poll recently this weekindicating that the American people rate the federal response to thisoil spill as worse than the federal response to Katrina, 69 percentnegative for the gulf oil spill, 62 percent negative for thegovernment's response to Katrina. Do you rate the government's responseto this oil spill as negative or positive? HOYER: Absolutely not. I think that that's -- the American publicare angry, rightfully so. BP was on site. The folks who own the rig,Halliburton, who constructed the piping, the concrete down there, theyare responsible with the federal government was (ph). Immediately upon this incident happening -- immediately... TAPPER: So you think the government's responsible? HOYER: ... the Coast Guard -- the Coast Guard was on site. Unfortunately, tragically, we lost 11 lives, but saved over 100 lives onsite. Thad Allen, the admiral, immediately put in charge, 17,500National Guard troops on duty right now. TAPPER: OK. HOYER: So there's been a vast response here. A natural disastercame along in Katrina, and, frankly, there were months before there wasadequate response. TAPPER: Leader Boehner, turning to Israel, a member of yourleadership team, Congressman Mike Pence of Indiana, said this on Thursday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PENCE: Remarkably, yesterday, the president said it was time forIsrael to sharply limit its effective blockade in Gaza, saying, quote,""The situation in Gaza is unsustainable."" The truth is, Mr. President,your policy in Israel is unsustainable. The American people are on theside of Israel and Israel's right to defend herself. Mr. President,whose side are you on? (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Leader Boehner, is expressing concern about thehumanitarian crisis in Gaza the same thing as being anti-Israel? BOEHNER: Well, I think the Israelis have a clear right to -- todefend themselves. When you look at this flotilla that came over, thefirst five ships that were inspected, there was no -- there was noproblem at all. It's pretty clear to many of us who've looked into thisthat this last ship was intended to be a problem, intended to cause aconflict. And this is part of a much bigger problem that we see with theadministration, where we've -- we've coddled our enemies and -- andpushed our friends aside in the process... TAPPER: Leader Hoyer? BOEHNER: ... raising a lot of doubts around the world, includingthe people of Israel, who are having serious doubts about our commitmentto them, our closest ally in the Middle East. HOYER: And I think one of the problems is, when you see Mr. Penceand you hear Mr. Boehner, this is not a partisan difference. Mr. Cantorand I had a colloquy on Thursday, which as John knows, I stronglysupport Israel's actions. They told these folks, come here, you're not going to break theblockade. Why are you not going to break the blockade? Because Hamas, aterrorist organization, continues to attack civilians, men, women andchildren, in Israel. And it is appropriate to have a blockade to make sure they don't getthe weapons or other materials to effect those kinds of attacks, whichare criminal, which are terrorist acts. So I think they did exactly theright thing in stopping that. And in fact, in my view, the sixth ship, as John has pointed out, weagree on this, five ships were stopped without incident. This sixthship was stopped. There's some reason to believe that that's exactlywhat they intended to do. Al Jazeera television showed attacks on theboarding party, and they responded in self-defense. Turkey knew that if these ships came, it was going to be a problem. And the Israelis offered to allow the -- those ships to be offloaded atan Israeli port and all the humanitarian gear go into Gaza. That wasthe appropriate thing to do. TAPPER: We only have one minute left, and I want to get yourpredictions for the midterm elections, literally one minute left. So... HOYER: History says we're going to lose a few seats, but we'regoing to retain the House. TAPPER: You're going to keep the House? HOYER: We're going to keep the House. TAPPER: Sir? BOEHNER: Our goal is to take the majority in the House... TAPPER: Not your goal. What's going to happen? Prediction. Prediction. You've said 100 seats. Can you do it? BOEHNER: We've got -- we've got 100 seats in play. We have a realshot at winning a majority so that we can put a check on thisadministration and all the spending that's out of control here inWashington, D.C. HOYER: Jake, they said that about Mark Critz in the 12th Districtof Pennsylvania. He won by 8 points. TAPPER: All right. HOYER: We're going to keep the House. TAPPER: Leader Hoyer, Leader Boehner, thanks so much for joiningus. I appreciate it. TAPPER: Joining me now, Microsoft co-founder and chairman, Bill Gates. Mr. Gates, thanks so much for joining us. BILL GATES, MICROSOFT CO-FOUNDER & CHAIRMAN: Great to be here. TAPPER: Obviously, the oil spill in the Gulf makes your proposal for $11 billion in energy innovation all the more resonant, all the more relevant. But I'm wondering, some are criticizing the president's handling of the federal response to the spill by saying he doesn't have executive experience and that's why he hasn't been able to -- to really get the federal bureaucracy moving the way it needs to. As a former CEO, do you think there's anything to that at all? GATES: Well, I think in any crisis like this, the key thing is to avoid them happening in the future. And I'm not an expert on oil recovery. BP is certainly incented to try and minimize the damage here in a very complex situation. But how did we get an ener -- energy infrastructure that is this fragile? You know, we've got a supply chain where we send a billion dollars a year overseas and you can imagine that there will be disruptions. When there have been in the past, we've always said, no, let's put a solution in place. But, in fact, the only real solution is to take American ingenuity and fund R&D to get energy in different forms that we're not sending this much money away and -- and that it's stable and reliable. TAPPER: Well, let -- let's talk about that. Obviously, your proposal for $11 billion in additional spending for energy innovation, there's not a huge appetite right now among the American people for more spending with the record deficits we have. Forgetting the merits of your proposal for a second, how politically feasible is it? GATES: Well, I would distinguish between spending and investment. What we're talking about is about 1 percent of what the United States spends on energy, being devoted to R&D. And so if you find a way out of the energy sector to raise that 1 percent, which is not some huge increase in the costs there, then you can tap into the unique ability in this country, through its universities, the national labs and entrepreneurs, to give us a form of energy that is both cheaper, not dependent on foreign supply and is environmentally designed so that we're not emitting carbon and getting into the climate change problem. The only way you get those things is through the breakthroughs. And I'm optimistic they're there, but we're not making the investment. Today we spend only about $4 billion on energy R&D compared to $30 billion on health, $80 billion on -- on defense. TAPPER: So that's your pitch. How receptive have you found lawmakers? GATES: Well, there is obviously a -- a tight budget. And it would be tough to say that this money should come from existing categories. The question is can the energy sector finance its own revolution and create these great R&D jobs here in America? TAPPER: What's the risk if -- if President Obama and Congress and the American people don't do this? GATES: The problem we'll run into is that we'll have more crises like the oil spill and we'll have the supply disruption. We'll start to see more and more effects of the -- the climate problem. The costs will go up because you're looking for oil in harder and harder places. So you'll just be paying more and more. And so it's an implicit tax. If you don't innovate, it's this gigantic cost that we'll be paying. TAPPER: You know, some experts believe that the only way to spur the kind of innovation and investment in these alternative forms of energy is to dissuade the American people and American enterprise from using oil and gasoline. Do you think that a gas tax is necessary? GATES: The -- that's not specifically necessary. You need some source of funding for this R&D. And, you know, so you would take some parts of the energy sector and -- and raise the money there. If you -- if you want people to switch, there's two ways to do it. One is to invent something that's lower cost. The other is to raise the cost of the thing that's forcing us to fund the military or creating climate problems and -- and help the new technology. The bulk of what's missing right now that will force us, at some point, to go for a very expensive alternative because we haven't done invention, is the -- this -- this R&D piece isn't getting done. TAPPER: Why do you think that the innovation and technology that's part of the oil industry hasn't advanced enough in the last 30 years, I mean to -- to plug this hole in the Gulf, they're using basically the same technology as they used 20 or 30 years ago? Why have -- hasn't that advanced? GATES: Well, certainly, in retrospect, they needed to invest more in these deep sea operations. Deep sea operation is fairly complicated in terms of pressures and temperatures how materials behave down there. And obviously, you know, now they're seeing the cost of not doing that. That will be reinforced in a lot of ways. So that particular innovation will happen. But you're going to get oil in very hard places. With other energy sources, over time, you wouldn't have to try that hard you wouldn't have to be bringing most of it out of the Middle East, where, you know, the chance of something disrupting that in the years ahead is -- is very measurable and -- and we're not -- we're not setting ourselves up to get rid of that over time. TAPPER: So tell us what areas you're looking at. GATES: Well, the idea of the Council's report is that you -- you fund R&D very broadly with an open mind. You don't just pick and say it will be synthetic fuels or hydrogen or fuel cells, but you get behind all of those things and you create metrics. In the solar area alone, there's so many different approaches -- solar thermal, solar chemical, solar electric -- and many different scientists. And that's the beauty of America, is you -- you can have hundreds of teams pursuing those things. And as they meet milestones, they can get more funding. TAPPER: The economic recovery has been slow and relatively jobless. What do you think President Obama needs to do? GATES: Well, the president can't just pull the levers and -- and make the economy take off. You know, the right emergency steps were taken and... TAPPER: So you support the stimulus and the TARP program? GATES: Well, you don't -- I don't think I need to get into the particulars. And it's easy looking back to say, OK, you could have tuned this or that. The incredible measures needed to be taken to make sure there wasn't a collapse, both in terms of stabilizing the financial system and then priming the pump of the economy, because it had been slowed down so much. Now, we're seeing the benefits that those things have been done. Now this is an international problem. And so everybody's dad is coming in, you know, are -- are those governments over spending? You know, our own government is looking at when do you cut back? And it's a tricky thing, because almost everybody agrees we need to keep spending up, you know, not take all country deficits to zero right away. But over time, you have to move in that direction. And so getting the timing right on this is -- is a very tough challenge. TAPPER: So do you think that there needs to be another stimulus to keep spending up? GATES: In terms of the U.S. in particular, lots of people, you know, have views that plus and minus on that in terms of if you did a -- a smaller stimulus, where exactly would you target? You know, our $16 billion for energy R&D, that's a type of stimulus. That is creating jobs and it's a -- a nice investment in the future. So where you get a twofer like that, that feels particularly attractive that -- that you can do that. TAPPER: Do you think the health care legislation is going to do enough to contain costs and control the deficit? GATES: Well, the -- the health care bill broadened coverage. And there's a lot of... TAPPER: Yeah, but beyond that, do you think it's going to contain... GATES: Well, in terms of cost containment, that step alone, in my view, is at most the start of how we look at not letting medical costs continue to go up. The projection is they'll continue to go up. And it creates a dilemma that if the government is funding those costs and if you're -- you know, you feel your taxation levels are going to hit some -- some limit, then what are you taking money away from? You're not going to take it away from your Social Security. You're not going to take it away from paying the debt. It's a tough problem. So if we could innovate to reduce those increases in costs that would be great. And I think there's a lot of work to be done there, you know, people – In some respects may be tired of hearing about health care, but in terms of really reducing the costs, no. The -- the years ahead, that's going to -- a lot of experts and politicians are going to have to -- to think about how that's achieved. TAPPER: Last month, Apple passed Microsoft in market capitalization, making -- it marked a historic moment where -- where Microsoft lost its status as the largest tech company in the world. Why did this happen? And -- do you still have confidence in CEO, Steve Ballmer? GATES: Oh, Microsoft is doing a lot of great stuff. I mean the software industry, you know, the opportunities are -- are pretty phenomenal. You know, the way that people think about TV, the way they think about reading, about learning, software is going to revolutionize that. Our company and our stock has gone up, it's gone down. And, you know, we've been the most valuable, not the most valuable. It -- you know, that's -- that changed and it will change again and again and again. There's room for more than one company to succeed in the industry. I -- I happen to like the things that Steve's -- Steve's doing. It's not my full-time work, but as a -- a board member, you know, I -- I see a lot of great things going on. TAPPER: Bill Gates, thanks so much for joining us.

(UNKNOWN): Yes, I am for real. (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: The quizzical stylings of Al Greene, the Democratic Senatecandidate in South Carolina, one of many topics we'll get to with ourroundtable, starting with George Will, former Republican Congressman TomDavis, from the University of California at Berkeley, Robert Reich, theformer Clinton labor secretary, and Democratic strategist Donna Brazile. Thanks, one and all, for being here. Let's start with the oil spillthis week. The fallout from the oil spill became transatlantic,George. Check the headlines that we see here. ""Obama killing all ourpensions."" ""Cameron fails to back BP in fight with Obama."" ""Back off,Obama."" This is how the British press is treating this disaster. BP,obviously, the biggest company in the U.K. Do they have a point? WILL: Well, sure, they do. This is a reminder to Americans at alltime that when they attack Wall Street and big business, they'reattacking the people who are supporting their pension funds. I don'tknow how many Americans depend also on BP, but a lot of them do. It'san internationally traded stock. So when you turn on the company, the liability of which is unclearat this point, but Congress, according to the interview you justconducted, is thinking of passing something that looks awfully like abill of attainder, which is to single out for punishment with specificlegislation a particular corporation. This is going to -- to ripplethrough people's 401(k)s and elsewhere. TAPPER: Tom, when you were in Congress, you were for a time thehead of the National Republican Congressional Committee in charge ofelecting Republicans to Congress, so you were focused on the mood of thepublic. What does this oil spill do to the mood of the public? DAVIS: Well, it adds to the narrative where the big institutionshave failed us, government, Wall Street, BP. The anger out there, Ithink, is greater than we've seen in at least a generation, and thisadds to the narrative of government sitting there powerless, just makingspeeches. It's let them down. TAPPER: Professor Reich, on -- on Wednesday, when President Obamaand other White House officials meet with BP executives -- do you likethat, that I called you ""professor""? REICH: I do, actually, yes. TAPPER: You're smiling. When he meets with BP executives, one ofthe things he'll be pushing for is a -- is an escrow account, athird-party escrow account for BP to put money in, and then a thirdparty will give out this money to people whose lives have been impactedby the spill. Where do you see this headed? REICH: Well, look, Jake, BP does not have unlimited resources. Ithas a lot. But inevitably, there is going to be a clash, because thecosts of this clean-up, the costs of containing the oil spill damage,the costs of plugging that hole are going to be in the tens of billionsof dollars. And the question is, how much of this is going to be borneby the American taxpayer and how much by BP? But the present spectacle of the Coast Guard asking BP to speed upthis clean-up is absurd. I mean, the federal government needs to be incharge. The president needs to be in charge of this. Use BP'sexpertise. Use BP's resources. But the president must be in charge ofall of this. Otherwise, he looks like he's just standing on the sidelines. BRAZILE: Well, the administration has been constrained by the OilPollution Act of 1990, which basically gives the responsible party thelead role in trying to not only fix the problem, but contain theproblem. That has been the problem from day one. They've waited for BPto come up with the answers, and we know that BP continues to misleadpeople. I don't have any sympathy -- and I -- and I probably have some stockor something in BP, because I have mutual funds, so let me just put thataside and say, all the people of Great Britain, this is not personal. This is not about your national identity. This is about a big region of our country that now has to deal withan oil spill that will go on for years and years and years, threateningthe livelihood of human beings, marine life, sea life, and a way of lifefor people who make that their homes, 14 million Americans. So when it comes to sympathy, angry, love (ph), go down to the GulfCoast, because we have all of it. And we're angry. Tomorrow, the BPdirectors will meet. I hope that they hold that money in escrow. I hope... TAPPER: The dividend -- the dividend money? BRAZILE: Absolutely. They made $6.8 billion in profit as of March31st. Hold it in escrow until the investigation is completed. Andwhile they're at it, process these claims. People are waiting, waiting in line now in St. Bernard Parish forfood because they cannot go out and fish. They can't hunt, so theycan't feed their families. They can't pay their mortgage. I have a lotof anger. I don't want my president to be angry. I have it for him. REICH: Go beyond escrow. Go into temporary receivership. TAPPER: You think that the Obama administration should take controlof BP or BP America? REICH: BP America, absolutely, Jake. Otherwise, not only is this apolitical disaster-in-waiting, because this is going to get larger andlarger, and the president looks like he's waiting on the sidelines, but,secondly, we have no way of knowing as American people that BP isactually telling the truth, that all of its resources are being put tothe appropriate use, and that it is appropriately balancing the healthand safety of Americans against the cost of doing this clean-up. This is a for-profit organization, BP, that is answerable to itsshareholders, not to the American people. TAPPER: President Obama is going down to the gulf, Alabama,Mississippi and Florida, tomorrow. And when he gets back, he's going togive an address to the nation from the White House Tuesday at 8o'clock. Last time he went down, his own White House video camerascaught him talking to residents down there, and this is what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: I can't just dive down there and plug the hole. I can'tsuck it up with a straw. All I can do is make sure that I put honest,hard-working, smart people in place, like Thad, to implement this thing. (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Congressman, this is the president being confronted withthe limits of his own abilities, even though he's been a big proponentof government and the ability of government, but here he is saying, ""Ican't do this. I can't suck up the oil with a straw."" This is adilemma for him. DAVIS: It is. You know, I did the Katrina report, too, the samekind -- it was an unforgiving storm. And even if you did everythingright, there was going to be a lot of anger, a lot of disappointedpeople. You have the same circumstance here. But you have to ask yourself, where was MMS? We've known this hasbeen a dysfunctional organization for years. TAPPER: The Minerals Management Service. DAVIS: Absolutely. I held hearings on this when I was in Congress,calling for reorganization and moving it back and forth. There'sprobably more culpability here than we see. We haven't gotten to thebottom line. It's easy to just blame BP, put it all on them, but Ithink a thorough investigation is going to show that there was abreakdown all through. TAPPER: George? WILL: Well, if there is a breakdown all through, I don't know whyhe thought it was a propitious moment to start a criminal investigationof a company that is in charge of this and that Bob wants the governmentto take over on the principle that the government will run anothercorporation well. I don't understand any of what's going on. The president -- and I don't know why he's coming back to talk to usagain. He's been talking about this nonstop for five weeks. BRAZILE: Well, some people believe that he hasn't said enough,George, and that this is his fourth visit. TAPPER: What could he possibly say, though? BRAZILE: Well, I -- I do believe that he needs to answer some ofthe questions that have been raised about the containment of the currentspill, whether or not there are enough federal resources to contain whathas already been in the gulf, to make sure that the states have theproper boomers, the skimmers, and all of the other resources they need-- they need in order to contain the spill. I think he needs to update us on everything he understands. Look,he may be able to split the sea, but I don't think he can cap the well. And I think it's even foolish to think that the president can -- cansplit the sea, but politics is in this, and it's draining his politicalcapital, so I think he needs to address this and talk about ouraddiction to oil, because there are some longer-term issues here,including a moratorium, that needs to be addressed. TAPPER: Bob, I want to turn briefly, if I could, just to the othercrisis that the country is facing. That's the economic crisis. Retailsales figures came out, and I know you wanted to say something aboutthis. They're actually down 1.2 percent during this time that theeconomy is supposedly recovering. What do you think the significance is? REICH: Well, this is very unusual, Jake. Hopefully, this is justan aberration, but we have this on top of 41,000 private jobs beingcreated in May... TAPPER: Not a lot. Not a lot of jobs. REICH: No. At this stage of recovery, particularly from this deepa recession, you need a lot of job growth, and you also need a lot ofretail sales growth. The fact is, American consumers just can't afford it. They'recoming out from under huge debt loads, and many of them are still facingthe prospect of joblessness. This is why it is so important -- given the private sector's andconsumers' inability to spend more -- for the public sector to spendmore, at least in the short term. I mean, the public is not being told-- and here's where presidential education is very important, Donna --the president is not being -- the president is not educating the publicand the public is not being told that there is a huge difference betweenshort-term spending to stimulate the economy and get the economy goingagain and dealing with the long-term structural deficit, which is mostlyabout health and Medicare. And these are two different animals entirely. TAPPER: All right, I want to move to politics now. You guys cantalk more about the economy in the green room in the green room segmentwe have later, but we had some really amazing primaries that happened onTuesday. In California, especially, where you hail from, Bob, there isthe Fiorina versus Boxer race is setting up for the Senate. CarlyFiorina, former HP chairperson, just won the Republican nomination forSenate. And here, right out of the box, is Carly Fiorina's greatest hitswhile she was wired for sound before a TV interview. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FIORINA: Laura (ph) saw Barbara Boxer briefly on television thismorning and said what everyone says. God, what is that hair? (LAUGHTER)So yesterday. You didn't... (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: So, Bob, forget the hair. Forget Barbara Boxer's hair fora second. There is a possibility that Barbara Boxer will be soyesterday. She is vulnerable. REICH: She is vulnerable. I think that what we are seeing inCalifornia, again, if you look at the history of this country,everything that is good and everything that's bad starts in California. And what we see in California is a huge, huge amount of spending,Republicans going through the gauntlet of that right-wing Republicanprimary, forcing Fiorina and also Whitman to the right. Now, we're not going to have primaries to kick around anymore orparties in California after this year, because Californians, in a -- ina flight of just desperation, said we can't stand it anymore and we'regetting rid of parties, especially. TAPPER: Tom, you wrote a memo to the -- your successor at theNational Republican Congressional Committee, Pete Sessions, outliningthe lay of the land, what you -- what you think voters are doing rightnow, what they're thinking right now. What -- what did you tell him? DAVIS: Well, it's very clear anger today is worse than it was in1994, 2006, when Congress flipped hands. I mean, that's clear. And theRepublicans have had a better recruiting year, I think, than any partyhas in the last generation, in terms of recruiting challengers. That'son the plus side for the Republicans. On the down side is, they still have a party branding issue. Thevoters threw the Republicans out in 2006 and threw them out in 2008. And when you ask which party is more acceptable, I mean, neither one is,but Democrats actually rank slightly higher than Republicans. The Democrats are prepared for this. They have -- all of theircandidates have over $1 million in the bank. They've seen this wavecoming. They've constructed a high seawall. You don't have the open seats the Republicans had in -- in 1994 toshoot out or the Democrats had in 2006. And instead of a wind at yourback, it's kind of a crosswind. And if you can be Scott Brown and getyour sail up and hoist it right, you can ride it into shore, but justrelying on, ""They're the other guys, we're not,"" is not going to work. The Republicans have got to take this anger and translate it indistricts across the country if they're going to win. They have apossibility of taking the House back. This is not an automatic. Thisis one of those strange years that voter anger is deep, and all thesethings we're talking about just add to that narrative. TAPPER: George, what do you see from Tuesday's results that youfind interesting? What conclusions did you draw, if any? WILL: How hard it is to draw national conclusions about this. InCalifornia, Barbara Boxer, 69 years old, running with Jerry Brown, 72years old, is not a youth movement out there. But Barbara Boxer gotmore votes, I believe, than Carly Fiorina and her principle challenger,Tom Campbell, combined, even though there was a hotly contestedgubernatorial and Senate primaries on the Republican side to bring outthe vote. In Arkansas, a right-to-work state, out of 1.1 million workers inArkansas, only 41,000 are unionized workers. Unions went in, spent $10million, accusing Blanche Lincoln of being insufficiently subservient. And, surprise, surprise, she won. Having won, she starts out 20 pointsbehind her Republican opponent. And in Nevada, Harry Reid might, on a good day, get to 43 percent inNevada. So he has to figure out in his canny way how to win with 43percent. Here's how you do it: You spend a lot of money to take downyour most -- what you think is your strongest opponent. You pick youropponent. There are six other lines on that ballot, independent candidates. That'll disperse the vote. And there's a none-of-the-above in Nevada. You can vote, ""I don't like any of these people."" So in that sense, hemay have brought down to 43 percent the winning total and his -- histhreshold of victory. TAPPER: Let's talk about that Arkansas primary, because SenatorBlanche Lincoln did finally defeat Bill Halter, who had been supportedby labor unions. And that night that she beat him in the run-off, aWhite House official -- an anonymous White House official -- called ourfriend, Ben Smith, at Politico and said, quote, ""Organized labor justflushed $10 million of their members' money down the toilet on apointless exercise. If even half that total had been well targeted andapplied in key House races across the country, that could have made areal difference in November."" Asked about the quote, here's what White House press secretaryRobert Gibbs had to say. He said, ""First of all, I should say that thepresident wouldn't agree with that characterization, but""... (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GIBBS: I think that whether or not that money might have beenbetter spent in the fall on closer elections between somebody -- betweenpeople who cared about an agenda that benefited working families andthose that didn't, that money might come in more -- more handy then. (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Donna, is the White House risking alienating labor withthat kind of talk? BRAZILE: I think, for the most part, labor decided to ignore thosecomments, although some of them were a little bit -- they were not toosatisfied with that comment. Look, organized labor does not exist to elect Democrats. They existto help workers, to improve their jobs, their benefits, their pay. So Ithink the White House needs to be careful in alienating labor, becausewithout organized labor, we don't have the sea legs to go knocking doorto door to get the few Democrats that they support elect to office. AndI know that from being out there for more than 30 years electing Democrats. That said, look, she ran a great campaign. Blanche Lincoln ran agreat campaign. She ran against Washington. Labor, the money did makeher the outsider. She was able to reconnect with her base, and shepulled her base out. She still has trouble in the general election, butshe ran a very smart, strategic campaign. And Bill Clinton helped her. He is popular. Ninety percent of thepeople in the state still love him. And he was able to pull out thestops to get her elected. This was ladies' night across the country on Tuesday night, ladies'night. It was double or nothing in many states. We have now morefemale candidates running for governor and senator as a result of the --the voter anger out there, and so that's a good -- that's a good signfor women candidates. That said, not all women are equal in this battle. I thought CarlyFiorina's comments about Barbara Boxer was catty. It was old-school. And we've long since stopped talking about women's hair, headlines (ph),coat jackets, et cetera. We don't talk about male grooming or theirties, so she should get better on her message. TAPPER: I get comments about my ties all the time. BRAZILE: Well, that's because you're married to a smart woman. But, you know, the Republicans spent a lot of money to -- to win inCalifornia, $100 million. That's a lot of... (CROSSTALK)TAPPER: You know, let me -- let me... REICH: And it was their -- and it was their own money. Let me justsay that in that gubernatorial race, in that primary, we had twocandidates who spent $100 million of their own money. TAPPER: And let's talk about that for one second, because --because the other CEO running for governor, as opposed to Senate withFiorina, is Meg Whitman from eBay. And here's Jerry Brown. He is theDemocratic gubernatorial candidate, and he told a local reporter, ""Youknow, by the time Whitman's done with me two months from now, I'll be achild-molesting"" -- he let the line trail off. ""She'll have peoplebelieving whatever she wants about me. It's like Goebbels. Goebbelsinvented this kind of propaganda. He took control of the whole world. She wants to be president. That's her ambition, the first womanpresident. That's what this is all about."" Bob, regardless of the tastelessness of comparing Meg Whitman to aNazi propagandist, Jerry Brown has a point in the sense -- not theGoebbels part of it -- but in the sense that she has a lot of money. She spent $70 million of her own money just in the primary. REICH: Well, again, California is the future. It means that,essentially, the ground war, the organizing on the ground, is reallyless and less important. And if you can spend a huge amount of money --or you, like Jerry Brown, have a brand-name recognition -- you can getthrough and possibly be elected. But if you don't have a lot of moneyof your own and don't have brand-name recognition, you can basicallyforget it. WILL: But California also has a history of very rich candidateslosing. There is such a thing as declining marginal utility of the lastdollar spent, and the Republicans may be reaching that. DAVIS: And we're seeing campaign finance reform, really, thatparties are -- they -- they no longer have the value. What's happenedis the money has moved away with the political parties with the new (ph)-- out to the Tea Party, the Club for Growth, MoveOn.org, to labor. Sothe party establishments don't have the kind of power they once did. REICH: But connect the dots. I think this is a very importantpoint, Tom. I mean, we've got so much anger in the electorate. Why? Because, A, we've got an economy that is not functioning for manypeople. B, we have a lot of physical representation of things out ofcontrol, such as the blow in the -- in -- in the gulf. And, thirdly, we have political parties that people now feel are notrepresenting them at all. So there's this kind of anti-establishmentearthquake going on in the country, and politicians ought to be aware. It's not just incumbents. TAPPER: Donna, I just -- we only have 30 seconds. You just talkedto the South Carolina Democratic Party chair, Carol Fowler, about thisbizarre nomination of Alvin Greene. Very quickly, what did she tell you? BRAZILE: It's a mystery. No one understands it. They can't -- noone can explain it. And there are all kind of conspiracy theories outthere. Some of them I might ascribe myself to at some point. This guycame from nowhere, walked in with a cashier's check with his namescrawled on it, went back home to his dad's house, never campaigned,never cut a radio spot, a robo-call, and won. TAPPER: OK, well, the roundtable will continue in the green room onabcnews.com, where later you can also find our fact checks. We'veteamed up with PolitiFact to fact check the show. TAPPER (voice-over): Good morning, and welcome to ""This Week."" It keeps getting worse in the gulf, while the nation asks, who's incharge and when will it end? OBAMA: We talk to these folks so I know whose ass to kick. TAPPER: And Congress turns up the heat on BP. Our headliners thismorning, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. HOYER: We need to get it stopped. TAPPER: And Minority Leader John Boehner. BOEHNER: Figure out what the hell went wrong. Then, he revolutionized computing, and now he wants to do the samefor energy. In a ""This Week"" exclusive, Microsoft co-founder andchairman Bill Gates outlines his vision for a clean energy future... GATES: The government playing a strong role is critical and urgent. TAPPER: ... and what it will cost. Plus, the roundtable looks at a big night for women in politics. And as always, the Sunday funnies. COLBERT: Eighty-two billion dollars lost. God. It would be such atragedy if any pelicans owned BP stock. ANNOUNCER: From the heart of the nation's capital, ""This Week"" withABC's senior White House correspondent, Jake Tapper, live from theNewseum on Pennsylvania Avenue. TAPPER: And joining me now is House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer andHouse Minority Leader John Boehner. Gentlemen, thanks so much forjoining me. BOEHNER: Hey, good morning. TAPPER: So you got a letter last night -- I actually think I got itbefore you guys did... HOYER: I think you did. TAPPER: ... but from President Obama requesting $50 billion inemergency spending for state and local governments. Leader Hoyer, youhave said that there is spending fatigue on Capitol Hill. Can you getthis passed? HOYER: Well, I think it's accurate that there's spending fatigue,not only on Capitol Hill, but around the country. People are concernedabout the debt level, and we are, as well. But clearly, you cannot notcontinue to stimulate an economy that is still struggling to get out ofthe deep ditch that we found it in about 18 months ago. What the president is saying is, we need to expend additionaldollars to make sure that we don't have significant layoffs in the nextfew months, which will again depress the economy, so that -- Iunderstand what he's saying. I have asked the White House to look atthe package that we -- the Recovery and Reinvestment Act that we passed,approximately $800-plus billion. There are clearly funds in there thathave not been expended to see whether or not there are some availablefor this more immediate priority than some that may not be quite asimmediate. TAPPER: Leader Boehner, the president said in his letter that ifthis does not pass, the economy -- there's a risk that the economy willslide back into recession. Do you agree? BOEHNER: Listen, I'm concerned about the plight of teachers,firemen, policemen who face the real possibility that they may be laidoff, but to send this letter up here on a Saturday night with noopportunity to cut spending elsewhere in the budget strikes me as alittle different. Steny and I and other leaders were at the White Houseon Thursday, and this subject never came up. There was no indication this was going to happen. And I'm askingmyself, why is this happening on Saturday night? Fact is that the spending spree in Washington is continuing to rununabated. The American people are screaming at the top of their lungs,""Stop!"" And -- and to move this without finding other offsets inspending, I think, is irresponsible. It's just putting more debt on thebacks of our kids and our grandkids, and it really begs the question is,why don't we have a budget this year? You know, we've not cut -- the House has failed -- not failed in themodern era to move a budget. And this appears to be the first time inthe modern era that the House is not even going to consider a budget. TAPPER: Well, Leader Hoyer, if I could... TAPPER: ... if I could say, one of the -- the theory is that youdon't want to make vulnerable Democrats vote for another spending bill,and that's why for the first time since 1974 there isn't going to be aHouse budget. Is that not true? HOYER: Whatever -- whatever the theory may be, Jake, the fact ofthe matter is, my friend, Mr. Boehner, voted for $2 trillion during theBush administration of unfunded spending. So when he says this cascadeof spending, he... TAPPER: But you agree that this should be offset with spending cuts? HOYER: I would hope that we could do that, yes. However, what Isaid was, money that has already been appropriated in the Recovery andReinvestment Act that has not yet been spent could be spent now on thesepriority items. Nobody wants to see $300,000 teachers or fire andpolice laid off. That's not good for the economy; it's not good for ourkids; it's not good for the safety of our communities. So the president's absolutely right in terms of this beingcritically important spending, and we're going to work on getting that. I personally believe that if we have dollars that are not yet expendedin the Recovery Act that we can apply to this immediate need and thenlook to later expenditures in the long term for investments, I think weought to do that. But we can't -- we can't stimulate and depress at thesame time. TAPPER: I'd like to -- I'd... BOEHNER: Jake, every family knows that in a tough time it's moreimportant to have a budget, not less. And if you think that they'regoing to move a budget on Capitol Hill, you must obviously believe thatElvis is still alive. TAPPER: Well, I'd -- I'd like to move on to another topic... HOYER: I know you do... TAPPER: ... other than Elvis. HOYER: ... but as you know, the Republicans didn't have a budget in'02, '04, '06. BOEHNER: The House has never failed to pass a budget in the modern era. HOYER: And the American public had no idea about that, budgets thatpass... BOEHNER: Well, this is a great opportunity... HOYER: ... and spending bills that follow (ph). BOEHNER: ... to cut spending and to get the economy going again. HOYER: And we're doing that. BOEHNER: That's why I gave the president... HOYER: Let me close with this. BOEHNER: ... a letter this week with -- 100 economists signed aletter saying that cutting spending now will, in fact, help get theeconomy moving again, get jobs back... TAPPER: I would like -- in terms of getting things moving again, Iwould like to move to another topic... HOYER: Look, can I conclude on the deficit? Because the president-- we've adopted statutory PAYGO, which they jettisoned. BOEHNER: And you've ignored it every time you've had a chance touse it. TAPPER: All right, guys... HOYER: The president sent down a freeze in spending. And heestablished a commission to look at long-term spending control. All ofthat is positive movement. TAPPER: Let's move on to the oil spill. BOEHNER: The American people want spending cut now. TAPPER: Got it. Let's move on to the oil spill, because I want toget your reaction. On Tuesday, the BP chief operating officer, DougSuttles, told the Associated Press that the flow ""should decrease to arelative trickle by Monday or Tuesday."" That's by tomorrow or the dayafter that, Doug Suttles said that. I don't know what a relative anything means when it comes to thisoil spill, but there's no indication that there's going to be -- it'sonly going to be trickling by tomorrow or the next day. And I just wantto know, as the leaders of your respective parties on Capitol Hill, areyou finding it tough to believe anything these guys from BP have to sayanymore? HOYER: Certainly BP has not been accurate in its representations. It has been misleading in its representations. What has happened isoutrageous, and the American public are correctly very, very angry. Andthe administration has been marshalling every asset that we haveavailable to work on this program. I hope he's right. The American public hopes he's right. Atrickle. I don't know what a trickle is. But certainly a very, verysubstantial reduction. BP said they could handle a 250,000-barrelspill. They have -- weren't able to handle what they said was initiallya 5,000, which was -- what then went to 20,000 or 25,000 and now wethink is a much greater spill than that. BOEHNER: Well, Steny, guess what? I agree wholeheartedly withyou. The American people want this oil leak stopped now. They want toknow what happened. They want the gulf cleaned up. And they want itall done now. And I just think that BP ought to be held responsible for all of thecosts that are involved in this. I've said that right from -- from thebeginning. And I continue to believe that. I'm sure that the federal government, though, was -- isn't alsoresponsible. The laws that were in place, the -- the materials thatshould have been in place for a spill this size were not, and thereaction, I think, on the part of the administration has been slow. Buthaving said that, it's time to get this thing stopped now. TAPPER: All right, just to... HOYER: The only thing I would say to that, Jake... TAPPER: ... just to clear up what you said earlier this week, onThursday, you said that -- that BP and the federal government shouldtake full responsibility. To clarify that, you think BP needs to pay? BOEHNER: I've said from the beginning, BP needs to pay for theentire cost of this. But the federal government -- this is a failure ofgovernment. Government is there to protect our shores, to protect ourenvironment. And there's been a real failure here. We've been asking for 55 days, where's the inspection reports fromthis rig? The administration won't give them to us. TAPPER: The Democrats are pushing a bill to lift the liability. Right now, it's at $75 million. Democrats are pushing a bill to liftthe liability cap. Do you support that? BOEHNER: I believe that lifting the liability cap on BP and forthis spill is appropriate. I have concerns... TAPPER: So lift it entirely for BP? BOEHNER: Absolutely. They should be held responsible for everydime of this cost. HOYER: Let me -- let me -- let me say a few words here. First ofall, the Republicans have been holding up lifting the cap in the Senatefrom the $75 million, minuscule sum, as we see, to $10 billion. Secondly, I think John Boehner is right in this respect: Thepsychology of neglect in terms of regulatory oversight that was pursuedin the Bush administration, which led to the banking failure, insuranceprices going way up, and oil companies thinking they could do whateverthey wanted because the ""drill, baby, drill"" crowd, all they wanted themto do was to drill. So I think John's right. I think the regularly psychology of thelast administration was not appropriate, and there was mistakes made inthis administration, as well. BOEHNER: How long are you going to blame the Bush administration? Come on. What's going on over at MSS... HOYER: As long as they're responsible, whether it's the economy... BOEHNER: No, that's -- listen... HOYER: ... or their lack of oversight, John, I'm going to do that. BOEHNER: Where -- where -- when is someone... HOYER: As appropriate (ph). BOEHNER: ... in Washington going to -- Washington going to takeresponsibility for what they are in charge of? TAPPER: I want to move on... HOYER: And the administration has done that. TAPPER: I want to move on to some foreign policy questions, butbefore I do, I just -- there -- there was a poll recently this weekindicating that the American people rate the federal response to thisoil spill as worse than the federal response to Katrina, 69 percentnegative for the gulf oil spill, 62 percent negative for thegovernment's response to Katrina. Do you rate the government's responseto this oil spill as negative or positive? HOYER: Absolutely not. I think that that's -- the American publicare angry, rightfully so. BP was on site. The folks who own the rig,Halliburton, who constructed the piping, the concrete down there, theyare responsible with the federal government was (ph). Immediately upon this incident happening -- immediately... TAPPER: So you think the government's responsible? HOYER: ... the Coast Guard -- the Coast Guard was on site. Unfortunately, tragically, we lost 11 lives, but saved over 100 lives onsite. Thad Allen, the admiral, immediately put in charge, 17,500National Guard troops on duty right now. HOYER: So there's been a vast response here. A natural disastercame along in Katrina, and, frankly, there were months before there wasadequate response. TAPPER: Leader Boehner, turning to Israel, a member of yourleadership team, Congressman Mike Pence of Indiana, said this on Thursday. PENCE: Remarkably, yesterday, the president said it was time forIsrael to sharply limit its effective blockade in Gaza, saying, quote,""The situation in Gaza is unsustainable."" The truth is, Mr. President,your policy in Israel is unsustainable. The American people are on theside of Israel and Israel's right to defend herself. Mr. President,whose side are you on? TAPPER: Leader Boehner, is expressing concern about thehumanitarian crisis in Gaza the same thing as being anti-Israel? BOEHNER: Well, I think the Israelis have a clear right to -- todefend themselves. When you look at this flotilla that came over, thefirst five ships that were inspected, there was no -- there was noproblem at all. It's pretty clear to many of us who've looked into thisthat this last ship was intended to be a problem, intended to cause aconflict. And this is part of a much bigger problem that we see with theadministration, where we've -- we've coddled our enemies and -- andpushed our friends aside in the process... TAPPER: Leader Hoyer? BOEHNER: ... raising a lot of doubts around the world, includingthe people of Israel, who are having serious doubts about our commitmentto them, our closest ally in the Middle East. HOYER: And I think one of the problems is, when you see Mr. Penceand you hear Mr. Boehner, this is not a partisan difference. Mr. Cantorand I had a colloquy on Thursday, which as John knows, I stronglysupport Israel's actions. They told these folks, come here, you're not going to break theblockade. Why are you not going to break the blockade? Because Hamas, aterrorist organization, continues to attack civilians, men, women andchildren, in Israel. And it is appropriate to have a blockade to make sure they don't getthe weapons or other materials to effect those kinds of attacks, whichare criminal, which are terrorist acts. So I think they did exactly theright thing in stopping that. And in fact, in my view, the sixth ship, as John has pointed out, weagree on this, five ships were stopped without incident. This sixthship was stopped. There's some reason to believe that that's exactlywhat they intended to do. Al Jazeera television showed attacks on theboarding party, and they responded in self-defense. Turkey knew that if these ships came, it was going to be a problem. And the Israelis offered to allow the -- those ships to be offloaded atan Israeli port and all the humanitarian gear go into Gaza. That wasthe appropriate thing to do. TAPPER: We only have one minute left, and I want to get yourpredictions for the midterm elections, literally one minute left. So... HOYER: History says we're going to lose a few seats, but we'regoing to retain the House. TAPPER: You're going to keep the House? HOYER: We're going to keep the House. BOEHNER: Our goal is to take the majority in the House... TAPPER: Not your goal. What's going to happen? Prediction. Prediction. You've said 100 seats. Can you do it? BOEHNER: We've got -- we've got 100 seats in play. We have a realshot at winning a majority so that we can put a check on thisadministration and all the spending that's out of control here inWashington, D.C. HOYER: Jake, they said that about Mark Critz in the 12th Districtof Pennsylvania. He won by 8 points. HOYER: We're going to keep the House. TAPPER: Leader Hoyer, Leader Boehner, thanks so much for joiningus. I appreciate it. TAPPER: Joining me now, Microsoft co-founder and chairman, Bill Gates. Mr. Gates, thanks so much for joining us. BILL GATES, MICROSOFT CO-FOUNDER & CHAIRMAN: Great to be here. TAPPER: Obviously, the oil spill in the Gulf makes your proposal for $11 billion in energy innovation all the more resonant, all the more relevant. But I'm wondering, some are criticizing the president's handling of the federal response to the spill by saying he doesn't have executive experience and that's why he hasn't been able to -- to really get the federal bureaucracy moving the way it needs to. As a former CEO, do you think there's anything to that at all? GATES: Well, I think in any crisis like this, the key thing is to avoid them happening in the future. And I'm not an expert on oil recovery. BP is certainly incented to try and minimize the damage here in a very complex situation. But how did we get an ener -- energy infrastructure that is this fragile? You know, we've got a supply chain where we send a billion dollars a year overseas and you can imagine that there will be disruptions. When there have been in the past, we've always said, no, let's put a solution in place. But, in fact, the only real solution is to take American ingenuity and fund R&D to get energy in different forms that we're not sending this much money away and -- and that it's stable and reliable. TAPPER: Well, let -- let's talk about that. Obviously, your proposal for $11 billion in additional spending for energy innovation, there's not a huge appetite right now among the American people for more spending with the record deficits we have. Forgetting the merits of your proposal for a second, how politically feasible is it? GATES: Well, I would distinguish between spending and investment. What we're talking about is about 1 percent of what the United States spends on energy, being devoted to R&D. And so if you find a way out of the energy sector to raise that 1 percent, which is not some huge increase in the costs there, then you can tap into the unique ability in this country, through its universities, the national labs and entrepreneurs, to give us a form of energy that is both cheaper, not dependent on foreign supply and is environmentally designed so that we're not emitting carbon and getting into the climate change problem. The only way you get those things is through the breakthroughs. And I'm optimistic they're there, but we're not making the investment. Today we spend only about $4 billion on energy R&D compared to $30 billion on health, $80 billion on -- on defense. TAPPER: So that's your pitch. How receptive have you found lawmakers? GATES: Well, there is obviously a -- a tight budget. And it would be tough to say that this money should come from existing categories. The question is can the energy sector finance its own revolution and create these great R&D jobs here in America? TAPPER: What's the risk if -- if President Obama and Congress and the American people don't do this? GATES: The problem we'll run into is that we'll have more crises like the oil spill and we'll have the supply disruption. We'll start to see more and more effects of the -- the climate problem. The costs will go up because you're looking for oil in harder and harder places. So you'll just be paying more and more. And so it's an implicit tax. If you don't innovate, it's this gigantic cost that we'll be paying. TAPPER: You know, some experts believe that the only way to spur the kind of innovation and investment in these alternative forms of energy is to dissuade the American people and American enterprise from using oil and gasoline. Do you think that a gas tax is necessary? GATES: The -- that's not specifically necessary. You need some source of funding for this R&D. And, you know, so you would take some parts of the energy sector and -- and raise the money there. If you -- if you want people to switch, there's two ways to do it. One is to invent something that's lower cost. The other is to raise the cost of the thing that's forcing us to fund the military or creating climate problems and -- and help the new technology. The bulk of what's missing right now that will force us, at some point, to go for a very expensive alternative because we haven't done invention, is the -- this -- this R&D piece isn't getting done. TAPPER: Why do you think that the innovation and technology that's part of the oil industry hasn't advanced enough in the last 30 years, I mean to -- to plug this hole in the Gulf, they're using basically the same technology as they used 20 or 30 years ago? Why have -- hasn't that advanced? GATES: Well, certainly, in retrospect, they needed to invest more in these deep sea operations. Deep sea operation is fairly complicated in terms of pressures and temperatures how materials behave down there. And obviously, you know, now they're seeing the cost of not doing that. That will be reinforced in a lot of ways. So that particular innovation will happen. But you're going to get oil in very hard places. With other energy sources, over time, you wouldn't have to try that hard you wouldn't have to be bringing most of it out of the Middle East, where, you know, the chance of something disrupting that in the years ahead is -- is very measurable and -- and we're not -- we're not setting ourselves up to get rid of that over time. TAPPER: So tell us what areas you're looking at. GATES: Well, the idea of the Council's report is that you -- you fund R&D very broadly with an open mind. You don't just pick and say it will be synthetic fuels or hydrogen or fuel cells, but you get behind all of those things and you create metrics. In the solar area alone, there's so many different approaches -- solar thermal, solar chemical, solar electric -- and many different scientists. And that's the beauty of America, is you -- you can have hundreds of teams pursuing those things. And as they meet milestones, they can get more funding. TAPPER: The economic recovery has been slow and relatively jobless. What do you think President Obama needs to do? GATES: Well, the president can't just pull the levers and -- and make the economy take off. You know, the right emergency steps were taken and... TAPPER: So you support the stimulus and the TARP program? GATES: Well, you don't -- I don't think I need to get into the particulars. And it's easy looking back to say, OK, you could have tuned this or that. The incredible measures needed to be taken to make sure there wasn't a collapse, both in terms of stabilizing the financial system and then priming the pump of the economy, because it had been slowed down so much. Now, we're seeing the benefits that those things have been done. Now this is an international problem. And so everybody's dad is coming in, you know, are -- are those governments over spending? You know, our own government is looking at when do you cut back? And it's a tricky thing, because almost everybody agrees we need to keep spending up, you know, not take all country deficits to zero right away. But over time, you have to move in that direction. And so getting the timing right on this is -- is a very tough challenge. TAPPER: So do you think that there needs to be another stimulus to keep spending up? GATES: In terms of the U.S. in particular, lots of people, you know, have views that plus and minus on that in terms of if you did a -- a smaller stimulus, where exactly would you target? You know, our $16 billion for energy R&D, that's a type of stimulus. That is creating jobs and it's a -- a nice investment in the future. So where you get a twofer like that, that feels particularly attractive that -- that you can do that. TAPPER: Do you think the health care legislation is going to do enough to contain costs and control the deficit? GATES: Well, the -- the health care bill broadened coverage. And there's a lot of... TAPPER: Yeah, but beyond that, do you think it's going to contain... GATES: Well, in terms of cost containment, that step alone, in my view, is at most the start of how we look at not letting medical costs continue to go up. The projection is they'll continue to go up. And it creates a dilemma that if the government is funding those costs and if you're -- you know, you feel your taxation levels are going to hit some -- some limit, then what are you taking money away from? You're not going to take it away from your Social Security. You're not going to take it away from paying the debt. It's a tough problem. So if we could innovate to reduce those increases in costs that would be great. And I think there's a lot of work to be done there, you know, people – In some respects may be tired of hearing about health care, but in terms of really reducing the costs, no. The -- the years ahead, that's going to -- a lot of experts and politicians are going to have to -- to think about how that's achieved. TAPPER: Last month, Apple passed Microsoft in market capitalization, making -- it marked a historic moment where -- where Microsoft lost its status as the largest tech company in the world. And -- do you still have confidence in CEO, Steve Ballmer? GATES: Oh, Microsoft is doing a lot of great stuff. I mean the software industry, you know, the opportunities are -- are pretty phenomenal. You know, the way that people think about TV, the way they think about reading, about learning, software is going to revolutionize that. Our company and our stock has gone up, it's gone down. And, you know, we've been the most valuable, not the most valuable. It -- you know, that's -- that changed and it will change again and again and again. There's room for more than one company to succeed in the industry. I -- I happen to like the things that Steve's -- Steve's doing. It's not my full-time work, but as a -- a board member, you know, I -- I see a lot of great things going on. TAPPER: Bill Gates, thanks so much for joining us. LENO: Eighty-nine-year-old White House reporter Helen Thomas isretiring. I'm going to be the first to say, ""Mazel tov."" (UNKNOWN): The Democratic Senate nominee in South Carolina, AlvinGreene... (UNKNOWN): Oh, Alvin. (UNKNOWN): ... is a mystery man. GREENE: So we should be pro-South Carolina, rather thananti-Greene, and speaking of me. SMITH: Where'd you get the $10,000 grand to file? GREENE: From my own personal money. (UNKNOWN): Where did he come from, and how did he win? OLBERMANN: How do you think the people voted for you on Tuesdayknew who you were or even that you were running? GREENE: You know, I think that they -- they saw -- I think thatthey -- you know, I just think that they recognize -- I think they --they heard of my name. (UNKNOWN): This is for real? (UNKNOWN): Yes, I am for real. TAPPER: The quizzical stylings of Al Greene, the Democratic Senatecandidate in South Carolina, one of many topics we'll get to with ourroundtable, starting with George Will, former Republican Congressman TomDavis, from the University of California at Berkeley, Robert Reich, theformer Clinton labor secretary, and Democratic strategist Donna Brazile. Thanks, one and all, for being here. Let's start with the oil spillthis week. The fallout from the oil spill became transatlantic,George. Check the headlines that we see here. ""Obama killing all ourpensions."" ""Cameron fails to back BP in fight with Obama."" ""Back off,Obama."" This is how the British press is treating this disaster. BP,obviously, the biggest company in the U.K. Do they have a point? WILL: Well, sure, they do. This is a reminder to Americans at alltime that when they attack Wall Street and big business, they'reattacking the people who are supporting their pension funds. I don'tknow how many Americans depend also on BP, but a lot of them do. It'san internationally traded stock. So when you turn on the company, the liability of which is unclearat this point, but Congress, according to the interview you justconducted, is thinking of passing something that looks awfully like abill of attainder, which is to single out for punishment with specificlegislation a particular corporation. This is going to -- to ripplethrough people's 401(k)s and elsewhere. TAPPER: Tom, when you were in Congress, you were for a time thehead of the National Republican Congressional Committee in charge ofelecting Republicans to Congress, so you were focused on the mood of thepublic. What does this oil spill do to the mood of the public? DAVIS: Well, it adds to the narrative where the big institutionshave failed us, government, Wall Street, BP. The anger out there, Ithink, is greater than we've seen in at least a generation, and thisadds to the narrative of government sitting there powerless, just makingspeeches. It's let them down. TAPPER: Professor Reich, on -- on Wednesday, when President Obamaand other White House officials meet with BP executives -- do you likethat, that I called you ""professor""? REICH: I do, actually, yes. TAPPER: You're smiling. When he meets with BP executives, one ofthe things he'll be pushing for is a -- is an escrow account, athird-party escrow account for BP to put money in, and then a thirdparty will give out this money to people whose lives have been impactedby the spill. Where do you see this headed? REICH: Well, look, Jake, BP does not have unlimited resources. Ithas a lot. But inevitably, there is going to be a clash, because thecosts of this clean-up, the costs of containing the oil spill damage,the costs of plugging that hole are going to be in the tens of billionsof dollars. And the question is, how much of this is going to be borneby the American taxpayer and how much by BP? But the present spectacle of the Coast Guard asking BP to speed upthis clean-up is absurd. I mean, the federal government needs to be incharge. The president needs to be in charge of this. Use BP'sexpertise. Use BP's resources. But the president must be in charge ofall of this. Otherwise, he looks like he's just standing on the sidelines. BRAZILE: Well, the administration has been constrained by the OilPollution Act of 1990, which basically gives the responsible party thelead role in trying to not only fix the problem, but contain theproblem. That has been the problem from day one. They've waited for BPto come up with the answers, and we know that BP continues to misleadpeople. I don't have any sympathy -- and I -- and I probably have some stockor something in BP, because I have mutual funds, so let me just put thataside and say, all the people of Great Britain, this is not personal. This is not about your national identity. This is about a big region of our country that now has to deal withan oil spill that will go on for years and years and years, threateningthe livelihood of human beings, marine life, sea life, and a way of lifefor people who make that their homes, 14 million Americans. So when it comes to sympathy, angry, love (ph), go down to the GulfCoast, because we have all of it. And we're angry. Tomorrow, the BPdirectors will meet. I hope that they hold that money in escrow. I hope... TAPPER: The dividend -- the dividend money? BRAZILE: Absolutely. They made $6.8 billion in profit as of March31st. Hold it in escrow until the investigation is completed. Andwhile they're at it, process these claims. People are waiting, waiting in line now in St. Bernard Parish forfood because they cannot go out and fish. They can't hunt, so theycan't feed their families. They can't pay their mortgage. I have a lotof anger. I don't want my president to be angry. I have it for him. REICH: Go beyond escrow. Go into temporary receivership. TAPPER: You think that the Obama administration should take controlof BP or BP America? REICH: BP America, absolutely, Jake. Otherwise, not only is this apolitical disaster-in-waiting, because this is going to get larger andlarger, and the president looks like he's waiting on the sidelines, but,secondly, we have no way of knowing as American people that BP isactually telling the truth, that all of its resources are being put tothe appropriate use, and that it is appropriately balancing the healthand safety of Americans against the cost of doing this clean-up. This is a for-profit organization, BP, that is answerable to itsshareholders, not to the American people. TAPPER: President Obama is going down to the gulf, Alabama,Mississippi and Florida, tomorrow. And when he gets back, he's going togive an address to the nation from the White House Tuesday at 8o'clock. Last time he went down, his own White House video camerascaught him talking to residents down there, and this is what he had to say. OBAMA: I can't just dive down there and plug the hole. I can'tsuck it up with a straw. All I can do is make sure that I put honest,hard-working, smart people in place, like Thad, to implement this thing. TAPPER: Congressman, this is the president being confronted withthe limits of his own abilities, even though he's been a big proponentof government and the ability of government, but here he is saying, ""Ican't do this. I can't suck up the oil with a straw."" This is adilemma for him. DAVIS: It is. You know, I did the Katrina report, too, the samekind -- it was an unforgiving storm. And even if you did everythingright, there was going to be a lot of anger, a lot of disappointedpeople. You have the same circumstance here. But you have to ask yourself, where was MMS? We've known this hasbeen a dysfunctional organization for years. TAPPER: The Minerals Management Service. DAVIS: Absolutely. I held hearings on this when I was in Congress,calling for reorganization and moving it back and forth. There'sprobably more culpability here than we see. We haven't gotten to thebottom line. It's easy to just blame BP, put it all on them, but Ithink a thorough investigation is going to show that there was abreakdown all through. WILL: Well, if there is a breakdown all through, I don't know whyhe thought it was a propitious moment to start a criminal investigationof a company that is in charge of this and that Bob wants the governmentto take over on the principle that the government will run anothercorporation well. I don't understand any of what's going on. The president -- and I don't know why he's coming back to talk to usagain. He's been talking about this nonstop for five weeks. BRAZILE: Well, some people believe that he hasn't said enough,George, and that this is his fourth visit. TAPPER: What could he possibly say, though? BRAZILE: Well, I -- I do believe that he needs to answer some ofthe questions that have been raised about the containment of the currentspill, whether or not there are enough federal resources to contain whathas already been in the gulf, to make sure that the states have theproper boomers, the skimmers, and all of the other resources they need-- they need in order to contain the spill. I think he needs to update us on everything he understands. Look,he may be able to split the sea, but I don't think he can cap the well. And I think it's even foolish to think that the president can -- cansplit the sea, but politics is in this, and it's draining his politicalcapital, so I think he needs to address this and talk about ouraddiction to oil, because there are some longer-term issues here,including a moratorium, that needs to be addressed. TAPPER: Bob, I want to turn briefly, if I could, just to the othercrisis that the country is facing. That's the economic crisis. Retailsales figures came out, and I know you wanted to say something aboutthis. They're actually down 1.2 percent during this time that theeconomy is supposedly recovering. What do you think the significance is? REICH: Well, this is very unusual, Jake. Hopefully, this is justan aberration, but we have this on top of 41,000 private jobs beingcreated in May... TAPPER: Not a lot. Not a lot of jobs. REICH: No. At this stage of recovery, particularly from this deepa recession, you need a lot of job growth, and you also need a lot ofretail sales growth. The fact is, American consumers just can't afford it. They'recoming out from under huge debt loads, and many of them are still facingthe prospect of joblessness. This is why it is so important -- given the private sector's andconsumers' inability to spend more -- for the public sector to spendmore, at least in the short term. I mean, the public is not being told-- and here's where presidential education is very important, Donna --the president is not being -- the president is not educating the publicand the public is not being told that there is a huge difference betweenshort-term spending to stimulate the economy and get the economy goingagain and dealing with the long-term structural deficit, which is mostlyabout health and Medicare. And these are two different animals entirely. TAPPER: All right, I want to move to politics now. You guys cantalk more about the economy in the green room in the green room segmentwe have later, but we had some really amazing primaries that happened onTuesday. In California, especially, where you hail from, Bob, there isthe Fiorina versus Boxer race is setting up for the Senate. CarlyFiorina, former HP chairperson, just won the Republican nomination forSenate. And here, right out of the box, is Carly Fiorina's greatest hitswhile she was wired for sound before a TV interview. FIORINA: Laura (ph) saw Barbara Boxer briefly on television thismorning and said what everyone says. God, what is that hair? So yesterday. You didn't... TAPPER: So, Bob, forget the hair. Forget Barbara Boxer's hair fora second. There is a possibility that Barbara Boxer will be soyesterday. She is vulnerable. REICH: She is vulnerable. I think that what we are seeing inCalifornia, again, if you look at the history of this country,everything that is good and everything that's bad starts in California. And what we see in California is a huge, huge amount of spending,Republicans going through the gauntlet of that right-wing Republicanprimary, forcing Fiorina and also Whitman to the right. Now, we're not going to have primaries to kick around anymore orparties in California after this year, because Californians, in a -- ina flight of just desperation, said we can't stand it anymore and we'regetting rid of parties, especially. TAPPER: Tom, you wrote a memo to the -- your successor at theNational Republican Congressional Committee, Pete Sessions, outliningthe lay of the land, what you -- what you think voters are doing rightnow, what they're thinking right now. What -- what did you tell him? DAVIS: Well, it's very clear anger today is worse than it was in1994, 2006, when Congress flipped hands. I mean, that's clear. And theRepublicans have had a better recruiting year, I think, than any partyhas in the last generation, in terms of recruiting challengers. That'son the plus side for the Republicans. On the down side is, they still have a party branding issue. Thevoters threw the Republicans out in 2006 and threw them out in 2008. And when you ask which party is more acceptable, I mean, neither one is,but Democrats actually rank slightly higher than Republicans. The Democrats are prepared for this. They have -- all of theircandidates have over $1 million in the bank. They've seen this wavecoming. They've constructed a high seawall. You don't have the open seats the Republicans had in -- in 1994 toshoot out or the Democrats had in 2006. And instead of a wind at yourback, it's kind of a crosswind. And if you can be Scott Brown and getyour sail up and hoist it right, you can ride it into shore, but justrelying on, ""They're the other guys, we're not,"" is not going to work. The Republicans have got to take this anger and translate it indistricts across the country if they're going to win. They have apossibility of taking the House back. This is not an automatic. Thisis one of those strange years that voter anger is deep, and all thesethings we're talking about just add to that narrative. TAPPER: George, what do you see from Tuesday's results that youfind interesting? What conclusions did you draw, if any? WILL: How hard it is to draw national conclusions about this. InCalifornia, Barbara Boxer, 69 years old, running with Jerry Brown, 72years old, is not a youth movement out there. But Barbara Boxer gotmore votes, I believe, than Carly Fiorina and her principle challenger,Tom Campbell, combined, even though there was a hotly contestedgubernatorial and Senate primaries on the Republican side to bring outthe vote. In Arkansas, a right-to-work state, out of 1.1 million workers inArkansas, only 41,000 are unionized workers. Unions went in, spent $10million, accusing Blanche Lincoln of being insufficiently subservient. And, surprise, surprise, she won. Having won, she starts out 20 pointsbehind her Republican opponent. And in Nevada, Harry Reid might, on a good day, get to 43 percent inNevada. So he has to figure out in his canny way how to win with 43percent. Here's how you do it: You spend a lot of money to take downyour most -- what you think is your strongest opponent. You pick youropponent. There are six other lines on that ballot, independent candidates. That'll disperse the vote. And there's a none-of-the-above in Nevada. You can vote, ""I don't like any of these people."" So in that sense, hemay have brought down to 43 percent the winning total and his -- histhreshold of victory. TAPPER: Let's talk about that Arkansas primary, because SenatorBlanche Lincoln did finally defeat Bill Halter, who had been supportedby labor unions. And that night that she beat him in the run-off, aWhite House official -- an anonymous White House official -- called ourfriend, Ben Smith, at Politico and said, quote, ""Organized labor justflushed $10 million of their members' money down the toilet on apointless exercise. If even half that total had been well targeted andapplied in key House races across the country, that could have made areal difference in November."" Asked about the quote, here's what White House press secretaryRobert Gibbs had to say. He said, ""First of all, I should say that thepresident wouldn't agree with that characterization, but""... GIBBS: I think that whether or not that money might have beenbetter spent in the fall on closer elections between somebody -- betweenpeople who cared about an agenda that benefited working families andthose that didn't, that money might come in more -- more handy then. TAPPER: Donna, is the White House risking alienating labor withthat kind of talk? BRAZILE: I think, for the most part, labor decided to ignore thosecomments, although some of them were a little bit -- they were not toosatisfied with that comment. Look, organized labor does not exist to elect Democrats. They existto help workers, to improve their jobs, their benefits, their pay. So Ithink the White House needs to be careful in alienating labor, becausewithout organized labor, we don't have the sea legs to go knocking doorto door to get the few Democrats that they support elect to office. AndI know that from being out there for more than 30 years electing Democrats. That said, look, she ran a great campaign. Blanche Lincoln ran agreat campaign. She ran against Washington. Labor, the money did makeher the outsider. She was able to reconnect with her base, and shepulled her base out. She still has trouble in the general election, butshe ran a very smart, strategic campaign. And Bill Clinton helped her. He is popular. Ninety percent of thepeople in the state still love him. And he was able to pull out thestops to get her elected. This was ladies' night across the country on Tuesday night, ladies'night. It was double or nothing in many states. We have now morefemale candidates running for governor and senator as a result of the --the voter anger out there, and so that's a good -- that's a good signfor women candidates. That said, not all women are equal in this battle. I thought CarlyFiorina's comments about Barbara Boxer was catty. It was old-school. And we've long since stopped talking about women's hair, headlines (ph),coat jackets, et cetera. We don't talk about male grooming or theirties, so she should get better on her message. TAPPER: I get comments about my ties all the time. BRAZILE: Well, that's because you're married to a smart woman. But, you know, the Republicans spent a lot of money to -- to win inCalifornia, $100 million. That's a lot of... TAPPER: You know, let me -- let me... REICH: And it was their -- and it was their own money. Let me justsay that in that gubernatorial race, in that primary, we had twocandidates who spent $100 million of their own money. TAPPER: And let's talk about that for one second, because --because the other CEO running for governor, as opposed to Senate withFiorina, is Meg Whitman from eBay. And here's Jerry Brown. He is theDemocratic gubernatorial candidate, and he told a local reporter, ""Youknow, by the time Whitman's done with me two months from now, I'll be achild-molesting"" -- he let the line trail off. ""She'll have peoplebelieving whatever she wants about me. It's like Goebbels. Goebbelsinvented this kind of propaganda. He took control of the whole world. She wants to be president. That's her ambition, the first womanpresident. That's what this is all about."" Bob, regardless of the tastelessness of comparing Meg Whitman to aNazi propagandist, Jerry Brown has a point in the sense -- not theGoebbels part of it -- but in the sense that she has a lot of money. She spent $70 million of her own money just in the primary. REICH: Well, again, California is the future. It means that,essentially, the ground war, the organizing on the ground, is reallyless and less important. And if you can spend a huge amount of money --or you, like Jerry Brown, have a brand-name recognition -- you can getthrough and possibly be elected. But if you don't have a lot of moneyof your own and don't have brand-name recognition, you can basicallyforget it. WILL: But California also has a history of very rich candidateslosing. There is such a thing as declining marginal utility of the lastdollar spent, and the Republicans may be reaching that. DAVIS: And we're seeing campaign finance reform, really, thatparties are -- they -- they no longer have the value. What's happenedis the money has moved away with the political parties with the new (ph)-- out to the Tea Party, the Club for Growth, MoveOn.org, to labor. Sothe party establishments don't have the kind of power they once did. REICH: But connect the dots. I think this is a very importantpoint, Tom. I mean, we've got so much anger in the electorate. Why? Because, A, we've got an economy that is not functioning for manypeople. B, we have a lot of physical representation of things out ofcontrol, such as the blow in the -- in -- in the gulf. And, thirdly, we have political parties that people now feel are notrepresenting them at all. So there's this kind of anti-establishmentearthquake going on in the country, and politicians ought to be aware. It's not just incumbents. TAPPER: Donna, I just -- we only have 30 seconds. You just talkedto the South Carolina Democratic Party chair, Carol Fowler, about thisbizarre nomination of Alvin Greene. Very quickly, what did she tell you? BRAZILE: It's a mystery. No one understands it. They can't -- noone can explain it. And there are all kind of conspiracy theories outthere. Some of them I might ascribe myself to at some point. This guycame from nowhere, walked in with a cashier's check with his namescrawled on it, went back home to his dad's house, never campaigned,never cut a radio spot, a robo-call, and won. TAPPER: OK, well, the roundtable will continue in the green room onabcnews.com, where later you can also find our fact checks. We'veteamed up with PolitiFact to fact check the show."

Bruce Rauner and primary challenger, state Rep. Jeanne Ives, debate abortion legislation during a meeting with the Chicago Tribune Editorial Board at Tribune Tower on Jan. 29, 2018. (Roger Tino Morales and Kayli Plotner / Chicago Tribune)Editorial BoardRepublican Gov. Bruce Rauner would love to spend these gray winter days focused on his November re-election bid against a Democrat opponent, but he can’t. First, he’s got to win the Republican primary on March 20, in which he will face off against former ally state Rep. Jeanne Ives of Wheaton.On Monday, Rauner and Ives made a joint appearance before the Tribune Editorial Board at which they sparred over who has the better strategy for addressing Illinois’ political dysfunction and creating jobs. This is their only scheduled debate; you can view it at chicagotribune.com/gopgov .Whenever an incumbent gets a serious primary challenge, that says something — that there’s uncertainty among party faithful, or dissatisfaction. Such is the case for Rauner, the former private equity executive who defeated Gov. Pat Quinn in 2014 as the unconquerable outsider.Turns out Rauner hasn’t been able to bend House Speaker Michael Madigan and the Democratic-run General Assembly to his will. The governor’s “turnaround agenda” stalled. Residents are fleeing high-tax Illinois. Employers are bailing, too, or choosing instead to invest in other states. We’ve begun to think about this election in dire terms. The Land of Lincoln has a festering pension crisis and a reputation as a loser. Job growth is weak. A lot of voters think Illinois must change or die.Ives, a social conservative, edged into the race after Rauner signed legislation expanding taxpayer-subsidized abortion for women covered by Medicaid or state employee health insurance. But now that she’s in, she’s running hard as a critic of the governor’s economic policy chops and his relentless public feuding with Madigan. One of Illinois’ problems is that Madigan actively blocks the governor’s job growth efforts.Before the primary, we will endorse a Republican and a Democratic candidate for governor. Today we reach only the conclusion that Ives, now in her third term in the Illinois House, makes a persuasive case as an alternative to Rauner. Especially on the question of who might work with, or work around, Madigan and colleagues, Ives presented herself as a Republican legislator who knows how to work with Democrats in Springfield.We said at the top of this editorial that the governor is eager to run against a Democrat, not another Republican. He made clear Monday he thinks his greatest adversary is Madigan, whom the governor attacked for being a property tax attorney in a state where many property owners challenge their assessments. “We need to focus on Speaker Madigan and his corruption,” Rauner told us. He then connected dots from Madigan to J.B. Pritzker, one of the Democrats running for governor. “Pritzker is Madigan’s handpicked candidate for governor. He’s in effect Madigan’s bagman for funding that whole corrupt culture.”One comment about such incendiary talk: We don’t see how it convinces employers such as Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who values a stable culture of governance, to invest money and hire in Illinois.Rauner wishes Madigan would just disappear. Rauner’s second wish is that the U.S. Supreme Court rules in Illinois’ favor in two cases that could weaken the role of unions and thus make the state appear more friendly and flexible to employers. Indeed that’s possible, but it’s bad policy to bet the farm on the deliberation of judges. Yet Rauner, as if he were quoting James Earl Jones in “Field of Dreams,” sounds convinced of his own good luck.“You watch us boom” after the court victories, Rauner promised. “Even if Madigan is still in power, which I hope he’s not after November, we will get changes through the courts that will allow us to compete. And the companies will come from Indiana. They’ll come from Wisconsin and Texas and Tennessee. We will be a rapid growth state.” (Remember that fantasy sequence from “Field of Dreams”? “People will come, Ray. They'll come to Iowa for reasons they can't even fathom.”)As a challenger rising from Springfield’s backbenches, Ives has a debating advantage because she can make fresh promises uncompromised by past performance or daunting realities. But she made a good point about having a track record of working across the aisle. She made another good point about targeting smaller victories to prove to employers and investors that Illinois can be more business-friendly. Her example: Address pension reform by shifting new state employees to 401(k)-style retirement plans. “It would have sent a strong signal to the bond market, to the business community, and to residents that we’re finally serious about doing something about not digging the hole deeper,” she said.Monday’s conversation was one moment in the campaign. The candidates have more time to differentiate themselves. Another debate or two would help. Bruce Rauner, with a strong polling and millions in his coffers, showed no interest. But he should capitalize on the chance to sell Republicans on himself. Because in Jeanne Ives they’ve got a legitimate alternative.Join the discussion on Twitter @ Trib_Ed_Board and on Facebook .

So why am I not more excited by the Gingrich surge? In the first place, Gingrich loves government more than I do. He has no Hayekian modesty to restrain his faith in statist endeavor. I’m for national greatness conservatism, but this is a little too great. Furthermore, he has an unconservative faith in his own innocence. The crossroads where government meets enterprise can be an exciting crossroads. It can also be a corrupt crossroads. It requires moral rectitude to separate public service from private gain. Gingrich was perfectly content to belly up to the Freddie Mac trough and then invent a Hamiltonian rationale to justify his own greed. Then there is his rhetorical style. He seems to have understood that a moderate Republican like himself can win so long as he adopts a bombastic style when taking on the liberal elites. Most people just want somebody who can articulate their hatreds, and Gingrich is demagogically happy to play the role. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

An error has occurred. Please try again later. You are already subscribed to this email. Most important, there is temperament and character. But they have very different temperaments. Romney, Levin observes, has an executive temperament — organization, discipline, calm and restraint. Gingrich has a revolutionary temperament — intensity, energy, disorganization and a tendency to see everything as a cataclysmic clash requiring a radical response. I’d make a slightly similar point more rudely. In the two main Republican contenders, we have one man, Romney, who seems to have walked straight out of the 1950s, and another, Gingrich, who seems to have walked straight out of the 1960s. He has every negative character trait that conservatives associate with ’60s excess: narcissism, self-righteousness, self-indulgence and intemperance. He just has those traits in Republican form. As nearly everyone who has ever worked with him knows, he would severely damage conservatism and the Republican Party if nominated. He would severely damage the Hamilton-Theodore Roosevelt strain in American life. It’s really too bad. We could have had a great debate about the progressive-conservative tradition. President Obama is now embracing Roosevelt. Gingrich has tried to modernize this tendency. But how you believe something is as important as what you believe. It doesn’t matter if a person shares your overall philosophy. If that person doesn’t have the right temperament and character, stay away. A version of this op-ed appears in print on December 9, 2011, on Page A39 of the New York edition with the headline: The Gingrich Tragedy.

I'm Christiane Amanpour. And at the top of the news this week: nuclear secret, a report of amajor advance in North Korea's nuclear program. What new threat does itpose? And how will it impact the president's disarmament agenda and hispush to get the Senate to ratify his START nuclear treaty? OBAMA: This is not about politics. It's about national security. AMANPOUR: This morning, the nation's top military official,Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen. Plus, theescalating war in Afghanistan. His views on night raids, relations withPresident Karzai, and deadlines for U.S. withdrawal. Then, hot zone. As Haiti reels from a cholera outbreak, we ask,what happened to the global pledge to rebuild the nation? And G.M.'s new start. Was the bailout good for America after all? Analysis on our roundtable with George Will, Democratic strategist DonnaBrazile, Ed Luce of the Financial Times, and former Clinton LaborSecretary Robert Reich. Plus, the Sunday funnies. LETTERMAN: The Capitol Hill Christmas tree arrives this week. Andas soon as it gets to Washington, it will die in committee. Did youknow that? ANNOUNCER: From all across our world to the heart of our nation'scapital, ABC's ""This Week"" with Christiane Amanpour starts now. AMANPOUR: Hello again. And with reports of a new nuclear facilityin North Korea and a new deadline in the Afghanistan war, there's a lotto discuss with our guest, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff AdmiralMike Mullen. President Obama returned late last night from the NATO summit inLisbon where the United States and its allies are now talking aboutanother deadline, the end of 2014 to hand over combat operations toAfghan forces. To make that happen, American and NATO forces areescalating the war right now, and so we start with a powerful reportfrom ABC's Mike Boettcher in Afghanistan. BOETTCHER (voice-over): When Lieutenant Colonel Steve Lutsky lastsaw 10-year-old Sadekela (ph), he was bleeding to death on the side of aroad. LUTSKY: His mom was yelling out that, ""My son is dead. My son isdead."" BOETTCHER: Now he is recovering at a U.S. military hospital. Thelives of the American officer and the Afghan boy intersected on thisstretch of highway in Khost province, when a car bomber trying to killLutsky and his men attacked their column. (on-screen): The American convoy was traveling this direction. Theother way, civilian vehicles. They slowed down when the convoy passed. So did a suicide bomber. And inside his car, he had 600 pounds of highexplosives. (voice-over): The soldiers were not hurt, but the explosion killedone child and injured three others, including Sadekela (ph). Now angryat the Taliban, Sadekela's (ph) family is grateful to the Americans forsaving his life, a small but important victory in a war where notkilling civilians is more important than killing the enemy. TOWNSEND: It buys us credit, in the sense that there's a littlemore respect for us and there's a little more trust for us. BOETTCHER: America's top officers tell Afghans that it's theTaliban who are killing civilians, a message undermined by PresidentKarzai's claims that U.S. special operations night raids are killinginnocent people. (UNKNOWN): Nine out of 10 civilian casualties are caused by theTaliban. BOETTCHER: At a district center in eastern Afghanistan, noteveryone is convinced by that argument. During a visit by the 101stAirborne's deputy commander in Afghanistan, Steve Townsend (ph), avillage elder asserted that the Americans were killing more Afghans thanthe Soviets did a quarter century ago. Townsend pushed back hard. (UNKNOWN): Look in my eyes right now. You know I'm telling thetruth. BOETTCHER: But as the words fly, so do bombs and bullets. CombatOutpost Firra (ph), situated on the Pakistan border, is often attacked. During one assault, 18 insurgents died, but soldiers know this: Youcan't kill your way out of Afghanistan. (UNKNOWN): They can reconstitute faster than we can. We're soclose to Pakistan that they just come right across the border. BOETTCHER: So rather than enemy body counts, real success here ismeasured in how quickly Afghan feet can fill American-made boots. Ifthe war is to end, Afghan soldiers will have to end it. (UNKNOWN): We have to make a difference. Coming here and -- andjust running around and killing the enemy and then leaving and lookingback and saying, ""I didn't make a difference, I didn't make a change,""will cause us to never leave. BOETTCHER: Steve Lutsky's son is the same age as young Sadekela(ph), 10. The colonel wants only one thing to come from his servicehere: confidence that his own son someday will not be fighting hisfather's war. For ""This Week,"" Mike Boettcher, ABC News, Forward Operating BaseClark, Afghanistan. AMANPOUR: And joining me now is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs ofStaff, Admiral Mike Mullen. Welcome to ""This Week."" MULLEN: Good morning. AMANPOUR: And we will discuss, of course, Afghanistan, but let meget to the breaking news this morning, the report by the New York Timesof the discovery of a new nuclear facility in North Korea. How much ofa threat is that to the United States, to the world? MULLEN: Well, this validates a long-standing concern that we've hadwith respect to North Korea and -- and its enrichment of uranium. Italso continues to validate a country that is led by a dictator who isconstantly -- who constantly desires to destabilize the region. Andhe's done that again, certainly, with this capability, as well. And certainly the development of nuclear weapons is a huge concernfor all of us, those in the region, as well as those around the globe. AMANPOUR: How could this have happened in secret, despite thesanctions that were put on? Practically as the sanctions were put on,this was being built. MULLEN: Well, he's defied sanctions. There are two, actually, U.N. Security Council sanctions that he's defied in this. He's defied whathe said he'd do in 2005, because he said he clearly would comply and not-- not do the -- generate this kind of capability, and yet he does. AMANPOUR: Right. But what options, then, do you have? Ifsanctions are the toughest measure and he's doing it, what's your answerto that? MULLEN: Well, I think we have to continue to bring pressure on himspecifically. Those in the region -- in particular the six-party talkcountries, Russia, China, the United States, Japan, and South Korea, weall -- we have to continue to do that. He is predictable in his unpredictability, if you will, because nottoo long ago, he killed 46 South Korean sailors. He has over timecontinued to destabilize this region. And, in fact, I also believe thatthis has to do with a succession plan for his son. AMANPOUR: But do you think they're planning to make more nuclearweapons? What do you think they're trying to do? And again, ifsanctions aren't working, what will? MULLEN: Well, the assumption certainly is, that they continue tohead in the direction of additional nuclear weapons. And they're also-- they also are known to proliferate this technology. So they're a very dangerous country. And -- and he has been someonewho has not responded thus far to previous actions. He actually blowshot and cold. He moves in a direction for a while, and then he reverts,and I certainly would see him in his reversion mode at this particularpoint in time. AMANPOUR: And why didn't U.S. intelligence discover this? MULLEN: Well, I won't go into any... AMANPOUR: But isn't that alarming? MULLEN: I won't go into any specific intelligence kinds of thingstoday, Christiane, but I would say that, you know, this is somethingwe've been concerned about for a significant period of time, and alsopenetration of -- of the North Koreans, in terms of intelligencecapabilities, is very, very difficult. AMANPOUR: Do you think China is the one to help you resolve this? MULLEN: I think China has... MULLEN: ... an awful lot to do with that. We've been engaged withChina for an extended period of time with respect to North Korea. Thepresident sent out a team to each of the capitals this weekend tore-engage, and so that's where we are right now, and I'm sure we willcontinue to do that. And a great part of this, I think, will have to bedone through Beijing. AMANPOUR: Are you worried about North Korea making more nuclearweapons right now with this facility? Is that what it's showing? MULLEN: I've been worried about North Korea and its potentialnuclear capability for a long time. This certainly gives that potentialreal life, very visible life that we all ought to be very, very focusedon. AMANPOUR: The president and the president of Russia have signed theNew START treaty. This week, that has been sort of stopped, stoppingSTART in the Senate by the number-two Republican senator there, Jon Kyl. Can I ask you -- I'm basically going to wave around a veritable""who's who"" of Republican and Democratic former secretaries of state, ofdefense, all sorts of people who have been studying this for a long timeand say that this has to be ratified. Does it have to be ratified? Isthis necessary for U.S. national -- national security? MULLEN: I think this is -- more than anything else, it's a nationalsecurity issue. I was involved extensively in the negotiations with mycounterpart in Russia. We have for decades have had treaties with themto -- to be able to -- to verify aspects of the nuclear weaponscapabilities that we both have. And from a national securityperspective, this is absolutely critical. AMANPOUR: So when it comes to the military impact of this treaty,are you convinced that all the military issues have been dealt with andthe United States would be no weaker or a in no worse place if this wasratified? MULLEN: Completely comfortable with where we are militarily,myself, the rest of the uniformed leadership, as well as the secretaryof defense. AMANPOUR: And the intelligence agencies have signed off on all theverification procedures and measures? You're comfortable with that? MULLEN: Absolutely. The verification regime that exists in this isin ways better than the one that has existed in the past. Somecriticize that there are fewer inspections; the arsenal is much smallerthan it used to be. We are close to one year without any ability toverify what's going on in Russia. AMANPOUR: And you're comfortable with the amount of money that thepresident and the administration has pledged to modernize Americannuclear arsenals? MULLEN: I have. I reviewed it -- I've reviewed it several times. And it is a very clear commitment to modernize the nuclearinfrastructure in this country. AMANPOUR: So by a process of elimination, is the Senate playingpolitics with American national security? MULLEN: Well, you'd have to ask the Senate about that. AMANPOUR: What do you think? MULLEN: Well, certainly, what I think is that there is a sense ofurgency with respect to ratifying this treaty that needs to be bothrecognized. Historically this has been bipartisan. This is a nationalsecurity issue of great significance. And the sooner we get it done,the better. AMANPOUR: In a lame-duck session? MULLEN: As soon as possible. AMANPOUR: In a lame-duck session? MULLEN: Certainly, the potential is there for a lame-duck,absolutely. AMANPOUR: And you would want that? MULLEN: I would -- that's the soonest possible time, absolutely. AMANPOUR: And just so we're clear, why does one need Russia'scooperation today? MULLEN: I've worked hard, not just in this treaty, with mycounterpart in Russia, and I've seen it up and down our government overthe course of the last couple of years, and we've really takensignificant steps, no better example than this weekend, where PresidentMedvedev was actually in Lisbon with all of NATO supportive of a missiledefense treaty -- I'm sorry, missile defense capability in the future. And a year or two ago, that just not would have been possible. The Russians have supported us in Afghanistan, allowed us totransport some of our most significant equipment, where they could havepushed back on that. They've also helped in other ways that wouldn't be widely known. Sothe relationship is maturing, very specifically, and it's one that'shelped us in Iran. So they've -- so -- so there's been an awful lottied into the improvement of this relationship. AMANPOUR: Not ratifying it, does that harm American credibility? For instance, many of the senators who are saying, no, let's not do itin this lame-duck session are the very ones who say we need to make surethat Iran doesn't proliferate nuclear material, we need to make sure, aswe've just seen, that North Korea does not. How does this affectAmerica's credibility when it comes to nonproliferation? MULLEN: Well, I think President Obama said coming out of this NATOsummit many of the leaders there spoke to him about the need to ratifythis New START treaty, and certainly it's indicative of the commitmentthat many other countries have to us and the importance of getting itdone. So I'm certainly concerned about how -- and in particular, how welook and also this -- this emerging relationship with Russia and what itwould mean to not do that. And they've clearly sent signals alreadywith respect to that which haven't been positive. AMANPOUR: What signals? MULLEN: Just -- they've spoken to the need to get this done, theimportance of it, and whether or not it would be tied to thisrelationship, given all that we've done in the course of the last coupleof years. AMANPOUR: Let's move on to Afghanistan, an area where you said thatthey have been cooperating. They've just said that they're going tooffer more roots through their -- through their territory for materialfor NATO and U.S. forces in Afghanistan. In NATO, summit in Lisbon, talking now about a 2014 deadline fortransferring combat responsibilities to the Afghan forces. I've alsoheard -- is that an absolute date? MULLEN: Yes, it is. It's one everybody signed up to. AMANPOUR: All combat operations will be handed over to Afghans atthe end of 2014? MULLEN: I would describe it much like what we just went through inIraq, where clearly they have the lead for their own security. We arethen in some capacity, in a training, advising, and assist mode, whichwe would expect to be for some time, but in terms of combat operations,they would have the lead. AMANPOUR: So you see post-2014 just like we see in Iraq today? MULLEN: As best we can tell, absolutely. AMANPOUR: ... troops, operations. I mean, I ask you, because rightnow, how many areas have even been transferred to Afghan control? MULLEN: Well, one of the things that happened -- one of the thingsthat happened in Lisbon was the commitment to start to -- that transferin the spring, and that will be based on conditions on the ground and arecommendation from General Petraeus, literally district by district. So it's a significant commitment to start that this spring. Again, it really is a situation where -- where the Afghans thenlead, specifically in terms of their own security, and we think that'sabsolutely critical, and that they'll be capable of starting to be ableto do that this spring. AMANPOUR: Well, your own officers say, in fact, even in the leastcombative areas of Afghanistan, that it could take something like 18months to 24 months to complete a transfer to Afghan lead, in terms ofsecurity. Can they really, do you believe, take over security withinfour years? MULLEN: I do believe, as best we understand things right now, thatthat's very much a reachable goal. There's a lot to do between now andthen, clearly. Very dangerous place, very tough fight we're in rightnow. We certainly understand that. But that's a goal actually that President Karzai set out there andthat all NATO allies -- actually, all countries who are providing forces-- because there are some 20 other countries doing that -- have signedup to, and we think it's reachable. AMANPOUR: In order to do that, it looks like the situation on theground is shifting. In other words, that there is a huge spike inraids, whether it be drones on the Pakistan area, whether it be tryingto kill as many Taliban as possible on the ground in Afghanistan. Isthat what's happening now? MULLEN: We knew this year would be a particularly difficult yearbecause of all the added troops that we put in, among other things. Andit has been. And I would expect next year to be a very difficult year,as well. That said, the -- the security situation has started to change. Ithas started to get better -- better. We've sacrificed greatly, tragiclosses, far too many always, but we've also succeeded in starting toreverse the momentum. I think General Petraeus calls it we've arrestedthe momentum in some specific places... AMANPOUR: But he said it's not irreversible. MULLEN: No, it isn't irreversible, and it's still fragile. That'sreally where we are right now in this fight. AMANPOUR: So, given that fact, as you put it, what is therelationship with President Karzai, which seems to be basically all overthe place on any given day? What does he say now about night raids? MULLEN: Well, he's -- I think, obviously, most recently, he'sspoken to his concerns about that. The piece that you ran earlierspeaks to a huge issue, which is the issue of civilian casualties, butit also speaks to a point that was -- is oftentimes not clearlyarticulated, which is the Taliban are killing about 9 or 10 times morecivilians than -- than our forces are. And we are making extraordinaryefforts to make sure that doesn't happen. We recognize President Karzai's concern with respect to night raidsand some of the other concerns that he has, and we are doing all wecan. There has to be a balance here, very specifically. AMANPOUR: Let me move quickly over to Yemen. Al Qaida brazenlyputs out a statement today, yesterday saying that this is our tactic,bombs that cost $4,000-plus, a raid against all your multibillions ofsecurity in counterterrorism. Are they going to succeed with one ofthese cargo plane bombs? MULLEN: Well, there's an awful lot of effort going on to make surethat they don't. And... AMANPOUR: Doesn't that worry you? MULLEN: You bet it worries me. And I give credit to a lot ofpeople to -- at this point in time that -- that they haven't been ableto pull something like this off, because it's a very serious threat, andI believe what they are saying. They've grown, it's dangerous, and it'sa place we need to focus. AMANPOUR: ""Don't ask/don't tell,"" something that's hugely importantright now. A draft report has come to you; some 70 percent of themilitary say that it will either have a beneficial or nonexistenteffect. Do you think it needs to be voted on in this lame-duck session? MULLEN: Well, I won't speak to what the draft report says. We'llhave this report done here... AMANPOUR: Do you think... MULLEN: ... and to Secretary Gates in the next couple of weeks, byDecember 1st, and I won't make any comments on where I think we need togo until that report is done. AMANPOUR: You support it, though, repealing ""don't ask/don't tell""? MULLEN: From my personal perspective, absolutely. MULLEN: Because I think it -- it belies us as an institution. Wevalue integrity as an institution. AMANPOUR: You mean forcing them to lie about what they are? MULLEN: And then -- and then asking individuals to come in and lieabout who they are every day goes counter to who we are as an institution. AMANPOUR: Apart from the integrity issue, many of your allies --whether it be England or Canada or France or Australia, the Israeli army-- they have openly gay servicemembers in their military with no adverseeffects. MULLEN: Certainly. I've seen that, and that is very much a part ofthis review, and we'll incorporate that into the review andrecommendations which go up the chain. AMANPOUR: So were you angry with the new Marine commandant when hecast his own doubts over this and criticized it? MULLEN: He had made his position very clear in testimony. Whatconcerned me about his most recent comments, it came at a time where weactually had the draft report in hand, and we had all agreed that wewould speak to this privately until we completed the report and made ourrecommendations up the chain. AMANPOUR: And if it does not get voted on in the lame-duck session,is there any chance that it will come up in any reasonable time periodafterwards? MULLEN: Well, I mean, it's very hard to predict what's going tohappen. Obviously, from a legislative... AMANPOUR: But would you think it will put it down the road? MULLEN: ... from a legislative perspective. The other piece thatis out there that's very real is the courts are very active on this. And my concern is that at some point in time the courts could changethis law and in that not give us the right amount of time to implementit. I think it's much better done -- if it's going to get done, it'smuch better done through legislature than it is out of the courts. AMANPOUR: Admiral Mullen, thank you very much indeed for joining us. AMANPOUR: And the roundtable is next, with George Will, RobertReich, Donna Brazile, and Ed Luce from the Financial Times. And also, later, a report from Haiti on the cholera outbreak. Hasthe country been abandoned again? (UNKNOWN): Yes. Pull. Dang it. (UNKNOWN): Missed it. (UNKNOWN): Bristol the Pistol, you fired a few blanks during theweek, but tonight all guns blazing. WALTERS: If you ran for president, could you beat Barack Obama? BIDEN: She's always underestimated, so, you know, I think -- Ithink I shouldn't say any more. (UNKNOWN): There you go. AMANPOUR: A big week for Sarah Palin, one of the topics for ourroundtable with George Will, Robert Reich, author of ""Aftershock: TheNext Economy and America's Future,"" Democratic strategist Donna Brazile,and Ed Luce of the Financial Times. And I want to start with our interview with Mike Mullen. We'reclearly going to get to Sarah Palin. What do you think? Admiral Mullencould barely be constrained from saying that he thought this waspolitical, this holdup. REICH: I thought it was very interesting, Christiane. I mean, whenyou asked him that question, he was very, very tempted -- you couldalmost read his mind -- to say that, look, Jon Kyl is taking directionfrom Mitch McConnell, who says explicitly that the next two years aregoing to be about making sure that Barack Obama is not a two-termpresident. And, therefore, this is all politics, and therefore, theRepublicans are putting politics above national security. AMANPOUR: I mean, on an issue like this, they can't do that, canthey? I mean, really, he ticked off the military, the intelligence, thefinancial; all the questions that they had have been resolved. WILL: I take Jon Kyl at his word, and I respect him very much. Ithink what he says is, first of all, it's nonsense to say, as Joe Biden,the gift who keeps on giving does say, that it is -- the vital nationalsecurity interest of the United States is to ratify this in a lame-ducksession? That means that if we didn't have a lame-duck session, whichwe shouldn't do ever, the nation would be... AMANPOUR: But the vital interest is to ratify it right now, as soonas possible. WILL: As opposed to six weeks from now? Oh, please. AMANPOUR: But it -- but it looks like it would be put off, even ifit was -- they want more debate. They want to reopen it, talk about itagain. WILL: Jon Kyl is bargaining for the modernization of our nuclearforce. AMANPOUR: So it's about money? WILL: Can I give you -- that's part -- it's about the modernizationof our force. Can I give you Will's law of arms control? Arm's controlis impossible until it's unimportant. This is unimportant, so it'sgoing to get done. That is, who lies awake at night worrying about thesize, not the security, but the size of the Russian nuclear arsenal? Noone. AMANPOUR: Well, you're partly right there, because the size is notthe main issue. It's the verification, which is a huge issue, and,vitally, American credibility. Here we have this story from North Koreatoday -- how does America stand up and say, ""You guys can'tproliferate,"" if we're not going to do this? How can we lead? LUCE: Very, very difficult. I mean, Russia, of course, is a partof the six-party group with North Korea, and therefore its cooperationis also important there, as it is on Afghanistan, as it is on Iran. These broader implications for failing to ratify START here goacross the world. Russia's cooperation is something that Obama hasworked on very successfully, very patiently, along with Hillary Clinton,for two years now, and this puts it in jeopardy. Just one other point, though, about Mitch McConnell's pledge to makeObama a one-term president. Clearly, that's going to be the strategy ofthe Republicans. Question is, are they going to do it intelligently orunintelligently? And I think Senator Kyl, his comments and his stance,indicate it could well be the latter. BRAZILE: Senator Kyl a year ago, after returning from Geneva,called upon the Senate to quickly ratify this treaty. Now, what hashappened in one year? What has happened, clearly, is that theRepublicans have redoubled their efforts to block anything thatPresident Obama would like to see passed. They want to deny him avictory. This is political malpractice. And Senator Kyl said that himself. So it might be -- George is probably correct. This might be aboutmoney, to get more money for the nuclear industry complex. Thepresident has promised $4 billion more, but in all... AMANPOUR: In addition to $80 billion. BRAZILE: That's right. But in all of the hearings this year andall of the conversations, Senator Kyl, no one else, you know, expressedany objections, and now this is, I think, one of those political momentswhere they can succeed in blocking the president. REICH: You know, there were 21 separate hearings and briefings. Imean, this is not something that is being put suddenly on the agenda. And for Kyl to say right now we just don't have time or this is --there's not enough money I think defies logic. AMANPOUR: And, again, as Admiral Mullen said, it's not just a nicetreaty with a foreign country. It is about Russia's cooperation on allthe issues that the United States needs, whether it's Afghanistan, Iran,and all the rest of it. Plus, I don't know what you think, but some are saying that thiscould give rise to the hard-liners in Russia again, who just do not wantto -- who just don't want to deal with the United States. LUCE: Oh, absolutely. I think it's -- it's a dream -- if youpicked two countries that would like to see a failure of ratification,it would be North Korea and Iran. And I think that -- if that argumentdoesn't work with the Republicans, that sort of basic elemental nationalsecurity argument doesn't work, nothing is. There's -- there's agreater hatred of Obama than there is a love of American nationalsecurity. AMANPOUR: Let's switch right back to here and economic security. G.M. today this week had success, initial public offering. The bailoutworked? The saving G.M. worked? REICH: Well, it worked, Christiane, to the extent that, indeed,G.M. is now worth $50 billion, if you believe the stock market, andbefore, in the old G.M., was worth $25 billion. But what happened during the bailout? Actually, it was a -- it --it was not so much a bailout as it was a reorganization underbankruptcy, and they got rid of $80 billion of debt, they got rid ofthousands of jobs, divisions that were not functioning. Wall Streeterscame in and reorganized G.M. Why do we suppose the exact same thing would not have happened underChapter 11 bankruptcy, reorganization? It's not clear that the $50billion of taxpayer money was necessary. WILL: Of course, we'll get it back, unless their share price goesto $55 and they sell 500 million shares of the stock. Don't believe a word G.M. says. Remember that last April their CEO,in an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, and then echoing intelevision commercials, said G.M. has paid back the bailout in full. Itpaid back a tiny sliver of it, and it paid it back with government fundsfrom another account. So do not listen to G.M. AMANPOUR: Don't listen to a word G.M. says? LUCE: I -- I find that difficult to disagree with. I would,however, say just in defense of the Treasury's handling of this IPO thatthere is not an IPO in the world that -- not a privatization in theworld that isn't controversial, that hasn't been criticized for beingunderpriced or overpriced or misallocated. And in this case, clearly,they're going to have to see an increase in the share price to get thetaxpayer money fully back. BRAZILE: We saved a critical part of the American manufacturingbase, and that's -- that's good news during this Thanksgiving week. AMANPOUR: And, indeed, Warren Buffett, who knows a bit aboutbusiness, has written an op-ed this last week to -- ""To Uncle Sam, thankyou from your grateful nephew, Warren, for actually saving theeconomy."" Do you give the administration any credit for that? REICH: Yes, certainly. And the economy would be much worse were itnot for everything the administration has done. But, again, it's hardto prove a negative. It's very, very difficult right now. We look at the degree of anger and upset still there in the Americaneconomy, on Main Street. The Washington Post ran a survey not long agoshowing that 53 percent of homeowners -- 53 percent -- are worried aboutpaying their mortgage. Now, this may be a good economy for Wall Street, it may be a goodeconomy for the IPOs, it may be a good economy for the people in the top1 percent whose assets are in financial instruments, but this is not agood economy yet for most people. AMANPOUR: The economy is showing still slow signs of coming back. The job numbers keep getting incrementally better, but not enough toaffect the 9.6 percent. Was it -- is it -- is it actually going to help? LUCE: The G.M. IPO? Well, I mean, I think... AMANPOUR: Well, and the -- and the -- the measures, as WarrenBuffett said, that helped keep the economy from diving. LUCE: Yes, but they're all in the system. They're out there. Nothing more other than what Ben Bernanke and the Fed is doing is goingto be available in this political climate. And whether that will beenough to help, I think there are grounds for deep skepticism. I dothink we're looking at a Japan-style situation here of low growth or atleast the threat of that. One thing I'd say about the G.M. IPO, just to back up Donna, is thecounterfactual here. If G.M. had been -- had gone bankrupt and largeportions of it had been closed down, we could have lost several hundredthousand jobs. The exaggerated number of 1 million might be too high. The administration's communications effort on this has beenabsolutely abysmal. It's quite extraordinary to me how they haven't putthis forward more forcefully and -- and how the public still doesn't seejust how different a kind of bailout this was than the Wall Streetbailouts, which remain deservedly unpopular. AMANPOUR: Let me just play what Warren Buffett told us abouttaxes. Obviously, this is going to come up in this session of Congress,the Bush-era taxes, which either have to be extended or not. This iswhat he said about it. BUFFETT: I think that people at the high end, people like myself,should be paying a lot more in taxes. We have it better than we've everhad it. AMANPOUR: They say you have to keep those tax cuts even on the verywealthy because that is what energizes business and capitalism. BUFFETT: The rich are always going to say that, you know, ""Justgive us more money, and we'll go out and spend more, and then it willall trickle down to the rest of you."" But that has not worked the last10 years, and I hope the American public is catching on. AMANPOUR: So what do you think is going to happen? Where will thecompromise be? What is the tax situation going to look like? WILL: I think we can all come together on raising Warren Buffett'staxes. He wants to pay more? Let's -- let's do it. AMANPOUR: He wants to. He wants to. WILL: Of course. All billionaires say it's of marginal importance... AMANPOUR: ... in -- in -- in Seattle, by the Gates Foundation... WILL: But if you're asking, in the aftermath of November 2nd, arethe fellows up there going to come in and raise taxes? No. And by theway, on one of the tax -- the favorite new taxes of the wonk class inthis town is a value-added tax. They forget that last April the Senatevoted on this, in a non-binding resolution. It voted 83-13 todisapprove of value-added tax. REICH: You know, even in this town, that seems inured to hypocrisy,for the Republicans in Congress to say, ""We must have a tax break, wemust extend the Bush tax breaks for the top earners, but at the sametime, we don't have enough money, we cannot, because of the deficit,extend the unemployment insurance for working Americans who have beenout of work in record numbers, long-term unemployed,"" gets some sort ofan award for hypocrisy. I mean, this is absurd on its face. AMANPOUR: I want to raise the issue of Sarah Palin. She's had abig week, as we've been saying. Let's just play what she told BarbaraWalters, which will air on Barbara Walters' thanksgiving special. PALIN: I'm looking at the lay of the land now and trying to figurethat out, if it's a good thing for the country, for the discourse, formy family, if it's a good thing. AMANPOUR: Well, that was about whether she was going to run forpresident, and she was subsequently asked by Barbara, ""If you ranagainst Barack Obama, could you win?"" And she said, ""I think I might beable to."" Is she going to run? BRAZILE: Well, any time you say you have to check with your family,that's always in my judgment a euphemism that, ""I'm running."" Look, shehas a lot of commercial activity yet to sell before she actually tossesher gloves in the ring. She has a book to promote; she has a TV show. I'm sure George is going to stay up tonight to watch it, George. BRAZILE: And she has Fox News. So she has -- unlike other -- theother candidates that have to go out there and build up their name ID,Sarah Palin has a strong name identification. But once she decides to run for president -- for the presidency, allthings are off the table, all of this celebrity. She has to begin toput together policy papers. She has to put together an organization. And while it might look good, might look good to think about it, it'svery tough to run for president of the United States. AMANPOUR: Do you think she will? WILL: No. Well, no, I don't think she will, partly because thevery people that decide our elections, the independent voters, have madeup their mind about her, and it's a negative judgment they've made. After the 2008 campaign, she had two things she had to do. She hadto go home to Alaska and study, and she had to govern Alaska well. Instead, she quit halfway through her first term and shows up in theaudience of ""Dancing with the Stars"" and other distinctlynon-presidential venues. AMANPOUR: Where her daughter is participating. WILL: Where her daughter is participating. AMANPOUR: A mother's support. AMANPOUR: A mother's support. WILL: It's stirring family values, but not it's good training to bepresident. AMANPOUR: How does the world look at a Sarah Palin run in 2012? LUCE: With deep horror, I think, but also some amusement. I thinkthere's a -- there's a trope out there that this is the best scenariopossible for Barack Obama. AMANPOUR: Let me -- let me just play devil's advocate. Themidterms were characterized by the rise and the power of the Tea Party. Sarah Palin is a big backer, the godmother, the supporter. She -- shemade quite a lot of inroads. Many of her candidates, the majorityactually won. Why is this so -- so strange that she might win -- run? REICH: You know, Christiane, I want to support your -- and I thinkit's actually more than simply raising the question here. Sarah Palinis not only a realistic candidate right now, but given the degree ofanger in the electorate, anti-establishment anger, populist anger, she'sthe only candidate to come along who actually embodies that anger. This is not the ebullience and hopefulness of Ronald Reagan. Thisis not ""Morning in America."" This is the anger of people who feel thatthey're being screwed by the establishment. AMANPOUR: And talk about... REICH: And she is, I think -- look, I'm not going to make anypredictions, but I think that she does not have a negligible chance ofbecoming president. BRAZILE: Run, Sarah. I think she should run to upset theRepublican establishment. I think she should run to show the countrythat, yes, in an era where men still dominate, that women can still run. Of course, I disagree with all her policy positions, but I hope thatshe would shock the Washington Republican establishment and go outthere, build a kind of organization, begin to put together somerealistic issues that can -- she can present to the American people. Idon't think she will have an easy time beating President Obama, but itwill be an interesting year. AMANPOUR: And on anger... AMANPOUR: Yeah, go ahead? LUCE: If you look at her book itinerary, Iowa and South Carolinafeature very prominently, so there's certainly going to be an overlapthere, if she -- if she wants to run. She's... AMANPOUR: Last topic, TSA. Quick point, the anger here -- we'retalking about anger -- the anger -- and yet 80 percent of the Americanpeople say they would go through those full body X-rays. Are we makinga big deal about this? LUCE: I hate to be facetious, but I'd be quite flattered ifsomebody wanted to see me naked. AMANPOUR: That is facetious. BRAZILE: The X-rays are fine. I've been through full body X-rays. It's -- it's the intimacy of the new touching procedures that sort ofrattled my -- my cage a little bit. The man said, ""Don't mess with myjunk""? Well, don't open my jewels. Don't... BRAZILE: Yes, it's very personal. But I don't mind a full bodyscan. Just don't show my pictures without paying me. REICH: I think -- I think the problem here is that there's been somuch time since the Christmas bomber -- and people don't remember --Americans are willing to sacrifice privacy if they can connect it upwith a specific incidence -- incident where national security iscompromised. And I think -- the Christmas bomber was last Christmas. AMANPOUR: You're going to continue this in the green room, wherethe roundtable will continue at abcnews.com/thisweek, where you can alsofind our fact checks in conjunction with PolitiFact. AMANPOUR: And we turn now to Haiti and the virulent strain ofcholera that has just arrived here in the United States. In the pastfew weeks, it's killed more than 1,100 people in Haiti and hospitalized17,000. Haitians hold their general election next Sunday, but on thestreets this week, violent demonstrations were directed against UnitedNations troops who are suspected of bringing the disease to the country. It's been almost a year since the world pledged to rebuild Haitiafter that devastating earthquake, and that has not happened. Here'sABC's Matt Gutman reporting from Port-au-Prince, the capital. GUTMAN (voice-over): They are dying in the streets here. Thesesanitation crews treat the bodies and truck them to the morgue, whichhas already reached capacity. The government's failure to deal with theoutbreak and rumors that the United Nations spread the contagion fueledriots all week, violence the U.N. alleges is political. FISHER: In Cap-Haitien, there have been demonstrations which havestopped us doing our work for cholera victims, and those on thepolitical side say they know that these are demonstrations that wereplanned. They weren't spontaneous. GUTMAN: This is election season in Haiti, traditionally a period ofunrest. In the meantime, supplies to treat the living are chronicallyshort. WOOD: This stuff here, it's cheap, and life is not. If you lookaround here today, these people would all be dead if it weren't for this. GUTMAN (on-screen): You're not getting enough of it? WOOD: Yeah, and we're -- and getting enough of it. That's right. GUTMAN (voice-over): Dr. Tom Wood has been treating cholera fordecades. This is one of the worst outbreaks he's seen. WOOD: You know, God help us. GUTMAN: He weeps for all this misery and for the fact that thereneedn't be so much of it. Sean Penn runs a relief organization here. (on-screen): Americans have donated over a billion dollars for thiscause. Just a fraction of it has been used. Where is it? What's theholdup? PENN: Well, there's -- there's the -- what the American people needto know is that the fraction that's being used is in the administrationof the overhead of those organizations that are -- that have been taskedwith administering that money. GUTMAN (voice-over): The Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund has received over$50 million in donations; it has spent only a fraction of it here. American aid groups quietly blame Haiti's inability to absorb the aid,partly because of the scale of the damage here, but also because of thegovernment's ineptitude. But there's also corruption. Supplies rot at the port where thismountain of containers grows. Aid groups blame customs officials. (on-screen): ... just want to get a couple of answers about howthings work, how merchandise moves out of the port, and how you releaseit. (voice-over): ... held up the release of trucks and equipment formonths, medicine for days. (on-screen): These people don't have one or two or three days. They will die if they don't get this. WOOD: They will -- they will die without this. GUTMAN: This World Health Organization warehouse is essentiallyHaiti's central pharmacy. Now, there's probably enough medication hereto treat everybody in the country who has cholera. Getting it to them,though, is much more difficult. WOOD: The U.N. says is that, you know, go through this paperwork,sign that piece of paperwork, go see that government official, and inthe meantime, people die. GUTMAN: And epidemiologists are telling us they'll continue todie. Hundreds of thousands are expected to become infected over thecoming weeks and months. Matt Gutman, ABC News, Port-au-Prince, Haiti. AMANPOUR: And joining me this morning is ABC's chief health andmedical editor, Dr. Richard Besser, formerly of the Centers for DiseaseControl, and he was recently in Haiti. So, Dr. Besser, thanks for joining us this morning. I think, firstand foremost, how big a threat of spread is this cholera outbreak, bothto the United States and to the surrounding region? BESSER: Well, one of the critical things to know about cholera isthat 75 percent of those -- of the people who are infected will haveabsolutely no symptoms, so they're able to take the bacteria and bringit to another country. In a country like the United States, where there's clean water andadequate sanitation, the likelihood of spread is very, very remote,unless it's introduced into a migrant camp or place that didn't haveadequate water. The Caribbean, though, is a different story, and it's likely thatthere will be cases introduced to the Caribbean. Whether or not theyspread, whether or not they set up shop like they have done in Haitiwill depend on the quality of water and sanitation in those countries. AMANPOUR: And in terms of trying to get it under control in Haiti,we saw in the report that basic, you know, saline solution orrehydration and water is not getting to the people as fast as possible. How and what do they need? BESSER: Well, you know, cholera is one of the most rewardingdiseases to treat. If you get to someone early in the disease, you givethem oral rehydration or I.V. fluids, they're going to recover. Onedose of antibiotic will kill the bacteria. If you don't, though, if youdon't get those critical fluids to people quickly, they can die in lessthan a day. I was in Bangladesh last week and was watching how they treat it inthe cholera hospital there. And it was like a machine. They had thisdown to a science. In Haiti, the numbers coming out are very, very alarming. Ten timesthe number of people who should be dying from cholera are dying fromit. That's a good sign that people are not getting treated quicklyenough, that the solutions are not getting to people in time to savethose lives. AMANPOUR: And in terms of the billions of dollars that have beenpledged to Haiti, not all of them have got there, but can actuallysomething happen to improve this situation without a real infrastructureimprovement, without development? BESSER: Well, you know, the long-term solution is infrastructure. It's providing water treatment plants. It's repairing those plants thatwere broken. But if you look at Haiti before the earthquake, the numbers therewere really not good at all. Only 12 percent of the population hadpiped water into their house that was clean. Only 17 percent of thepopulation used adequate sanitation. So this earthquake did not hit a situation where you had a countrywith viable public health infrastructure that need to be repaired. Ithit a country that was really at bottom level, a country that did nothave infrastructure to begin with. And the critical thing for Haiti is, can they build a public healthinfrastructure that works? In the meantime, it's going down to thebasics. It's providing water storage containers and home chlorination,with tablets or dilute bleach. That can provide safe drinking water,but it takes a lot to sustain that effort. AMANPOUR: Dr. Besser, thanks, indeed, for joining us this morning,and we'll keep watching it. Thank you. And next week, we have a special program for you. They are economictitans, innovators, and risk-takers, now giving their billions back. Next Sunday, my exclusive interviews with Bill and Melinda Gates, TedTurner, and Warren Buffett in a rare Sunday morning appearance. BUFFETT: I just think the idea of dynastic wealth is kind of crazy. AMANPOUR (voice-over): What motivates them to give up so much? TURNER: It is scary, because everybody is always afraid thatthey're going to go broke. AMANPOUR: What they predict for the future of the United States. B. GATES: The question for us is, are we educating people well? AMANPOUR: And their solutions to the current economic challenges. (on-screen): Does there need to be a sense of sacrifice in theUnited States? (voice-over): Buffett, Gates and Turner, their giving pledge, aspecial ""This Week"" next Sunday."

Sadler, Campaign ManagerTo: Friends of CarlyDespite what the media is telling you, it is clear that Carly deserved to be on the debate stage, both according to their arbitrary metrics — and the ones that actually matter:* In an actual contest of voters, Carly came out ahead of Governors Christie and Kasich* She has the same number of delegates as Governor Bush. Governor Christie has 0* Carly is 6th in hard dollars raised and has more cash-on-hand than Governors Kasich and Christie combined* There is a ground game with paid staff in 12 states. In New Hampshire alone, CARLY for America has 12 full-time staff, 500 volunteer community captains and 77 canvassers.* Carly has endorsements from leaders in 27 states. In New Hampshire alone, we have endorsements from 83 elected officials, political leaders, party activists, and business and community leaders.* Recent polls — which are the standard by which ABC is making their decision about which candidates to include — show Carly ahead of multiple candidates on the stage. A WBUR poll released yesterday has Carly surging to 8%We know how much this injustice outraged the voters of Iowa — whose votes were ignored — and the voters of New Hampshire, who don’t want the media and the political establishment unfairly winnowing the field before they get to vote. So we spoke with executives at ABC and political leaders at the RNC and made our case. But they decided to keep us off the stage to improve the chances of their favored candidates, despite what voters clearly wanted.And it wasn’t just us. More than 35,000 voters signed a petition to get Carly on the stage. Conservative blog PJ Media polled their readers: 76% said Carly should be on stage. Fox host Greta Van Susteren polled her viewers and 80% agreed that she should be on stage.Other candidates — including Ben Carson and Ted Cruz — called on ABC to change their flawed criteria and put Carly on the stage. So did Republican leaders, including Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich.Many business and political leaders joined in the chorus and offered their support to Carly:Current or Former Elected/Appointed Officials and Candidates* Governor Mitt Romney
