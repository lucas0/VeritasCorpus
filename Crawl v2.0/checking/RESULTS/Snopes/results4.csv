It was fitting that the quarterback capped off the weeks demonstrations, seeing as he was the one who launched the largest social justice protest the NFL has ever seen.But he was far from alone. Seventeen other players across the league joined him by kneeling or raising their fists during the playing of the national anthem before their games to draw attention to police brutality against minorities and spur conversations about social justice. The Seahawks Jeremy Lane opted to sit during the preseason, but joined in his teams demonstration of locking arms on Sunday instead.Here are a few striking photos that captured the moments.1.

https://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/adhd.asp	Dr. Leon Eisenberg — ADHD Is a ‘Fictitious Disease’?	mtrue	['adhd', ' leon eisenberg']	http://www.bmj.com/	http://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b4615.short	2015/03/14	Ned StaffordTransformed child psychiatry by advocating research into developmental problemsEarly in his medical career, in the mid-1950s, Leon Eisenberg became fascinated with the childhood mind. Wanting to know more, he broke free from the shackles of the Freudian psychoanalytic dogma that dominated child psychiatry at the time to conduct groundbreaking biologically based research of childhood developmental problems. This research included the first randomised clinical drug trials in child psychiatry.“I think what Leon brought to the field was a different way of thinking—thinking out of the box,” said David DeMaso, chairman of psychiatry at Boston Children’s Hospital and professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. “He was thinking in terms of biology, of evidence based treatment, way before anybody else. His was a bio-psycho-social model at a time when psychoanalytical thinking was the norm.”Eisenberg’s direct involvement as a child psychiatry researcher was over by 1967, when he moved to Harvard Medical School as chief of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital. But in a dozen years he had helped transform the discipline.Beginning in 1952 at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Eisenberg began a fellowship under Leo Kanner, the Austrian born child psychiatrist, who, in the early 1940s, first described autism. In a study of autistic adolescents published in 1956, Eisenberg recognised patterns of language use as the best predictor of prognosis. At the time, many patients who are now are diagnosed as having autism were thought to have mental retardation.He followed that paper with a barrage of papers on attention deficit disorder, learning delays, and other childhood problems. In a study of children otherwise developing normally, Eisenberg found that early reading difficulties increased the chances of later bad behaviour.His most revolutionary study came in 1962, when he launched the first randomised clinical drug trial in child psychiatry. In subsequent drug trials he showed that tranquillising drugs were inferior to placebo in the treatment of anxiety disorders and that stimulant drugs could be effective in controlling hyperactivity. Those studies were the first steps towards ever increasing use of drugs to treat child and adolescent disorders, a development that in recent years concerned Eisenberg.Drug companiesDeMaso, who in the late 1970s became one of Eisenberg’s many protégés, said that Eisenberg thought that many psychiatrists were being influenced by drug companies, adding, “He thought children are now being overdiagnosed with bipolar illness and then overmedicated.”Leon Eisenberg was born in Philadelphia on 8 August 1922, the oldest child of Russian immigrants. His father steered him from the beginning towards medical school. But despite near straight As in college, he was turned down by several medical schools because of his Jewish background. Finally, with help from a Pennsylvania state legislator who his father knew, he was admitted to the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.After graduating in 1946 as valedictorian of his class, he took a rotating intern position at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York city, where he became interested in psychiatry. He served two years as a captain in the US Army Medical Corps and in 1952 moved to Johns Hopkins, becoming chief of child psychiatry in 1961. He held the position until becoming chief of psychiatry in 1967 at Harvard, where his focus shifted to training new generations of researchers.Although Eisenberg has been widely recognised for his childhood research, the Harvard psychiatrist and anthropologist Arthur Kleinman thinks that his contributions from the 1970s onward are as important. Kleinman, a psychiatry resident in the 1970s under Eisenberg, said that he converted the department from a small group of mostly psychoanalysts to a diverse and vibrant national powerhouse that helped shape modern psychiatry. “He made that department,” Kleinman says. “He set the intellectual tone to be highly academic.”In 1968 Eisenberg also became a leading proponent of affirmative action for African Americans and other minorities at Harvard Medical School, guided by his own experiences of discrimination as a Jew in the 1940s.Social sciencesDuring the 1970s, Eisenberg advocated a closer relationship between medicine and the social sciences, which he thought would improve medical care by, as Kleinman put it, “bringing biology together with the social world.” In 1980 Eisenberg became founding chairman of Harvard’s department of social medicine, a position he held until 1991. Eisenberg was the ideal choice to guide the new department, said Kleinman, adding, “He had an omnivorous hunger for knowledge that went across the fields.”Eisenberg was honoured with numerous awards, including the distinguished service award and special presidential commendation from the American Psychiatric Association. He served from 1964 as mental health consultant to the World Health Organization in multiple capacities and was an honorary fellow of the UK Royal College of Psychiatrists.On 1 July this year, the Leon Eisenberg chair in child psychiatry at the Children’s Hospital Boston was officially launched, with DeMaso named as the first holder. Decades after his groundbreaking studies, he still yearned to better understand the childhood mind. “I was eating lunch with him about a year ago, and he told me that more child psychiatry research was needed,” said DeMaso. “He asked me, ‘What are you doing about encouraging your psychiatrists to do more research? They need to do more research. We need more research.’” And DeMaso dutifully followed the advice of his mentor. “We are going to do more research in child psychiatry,” he says. “We are planning to focus on training the next generation of child psychiatry researchers.”Eisenberg leaves his wife, Carola, former dean of students at Harvard Medical School and a cofounder of Physicians for Human Rights, two children from a previous marriage, and two stepsons.NotesCite this as: BMJ 2009;339:b4615Footnotes	1

I mean…they live in trailers by the water, right?”Clinton began to laugh but Maddow stopped her:“Madam Secretary, that’s not funny. There are 37 million people in the path of the worst storm our country has seen since Katrina and it will probably do more damage. That was callous and wrong. You’ve been poisoned. Not everything is politics.”Maddow cancelled the interview and agreed to bury the footage, but one sound engineer who is a true patriot managed to keep a copy:“As soon as I heard her say it I knew she screwed up real bad. She was talking to people backstage about running for president again in 2020. There ain’t no way she’s gonna run now. Not without making me a very rich man.”The engineer, who refused to be named, says he will hold onto the footage until he needs it to either “save the country or himself.” He says he’s made “arrangements” in case anything happens to him. Share This As American As Apple Pie Article Now!3.5k	1

There’s literally no water. The beach and ocean are gone.”He tweeted a follow-up video that showed how the water had retreated at a beach in Long Island, Bahamas.By playing this video you agree to Twitter's use of cookiesThis use may include analytics, personalization, and ads.Download“Basically, Hurricane Irma is so strong and its pressure is so low, it’s sucking water from its surroundings into the core of the storm,” Fritz wrote.“In the center of the storm, where there is extreme low pressure, water is drawn upward. Low pressure is basically a sucking mechanism — it sucks the air into it, and when it’s really low, it can change the shape of the surface of the ocean. As the storm draws water toward the center, it gets pulled away from the surroundings.”Wayne Neely, a forecaster with the Bahamas’ Department of Meteorology, warned residents of Long Island and Exuma, where water had also reportedly receded from the beaches, to be careful as the ocean returned back to high levels.“Care must be taken in this case because the water often returns with even greater fury,” Neely said in a Facebook post explaining the phenomenon.SECURITY WARNING: Please treat the URL above as you would your password and do not share it with anyone.

Dermatologist Dawn Marie Davies, from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, warns sunbed users could be putting themselves at risk of contracting the sexually transmitted infection, herpesGenital herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact.It is commonly passed on through sex and oral sex.Once a person is infected with the virus it can reactivate every so often to cause a new episode of painful genital herpes.There is no complete cure for the infection - rather, a sufferer will be given treatment each time they suffer a flare up.

Ultraviolet light can theoretically kill germs, but it's not enough to kill germs on the tanning bed Dermatologist, Dawn Marie Davies  Bacteria that lies on a person's skin can easily be transferred to the bed, when a person is lying down.The heat - not high enough to kill the infection - allows the bacteria to develop to become stronger and more able to survive.When a person sweats, it provides a breeding ground for bacteria or viruses. It is then possible for the infection to transfer to another sunbed user, entering the body via a small cut or nick in the skin, often so small a person may be unaware.'Ultraviolet light can theoretically kill germs, but it's not enough to kill germs on the tanning bed,' Professor Davies warned.'What's interesting is that when you use the ultraviolet light over and over again - and the tanning bed lights are on for multiple hours a day - if the bacteria or virus is exposed to some antiseptic but not enough to kill it, or some light but not enough to kill it, it can grow stronger and then it becomes resistant.'  GENITAL HERPES: A HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS, INCURABLE STI    Genital herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact.It is commonly passed on through sex and oral sex.Once a person is infected with the virus it can reactivate every so often to cause a new episode of painful genital herpes.A recurrence of the virus is often triggered by being unwell, stress, drinking excess alcohol, exposure to ultraviolet light, for example, using sunbeds, and having a weakened immune system.   Herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact. Professor Davies warns that the virus can remain on tanning beds, infecting other sunbed users Symptoms of genital herpes include:small blisters that burst to leave red, open sores around your genitals, thighs and buttocksblisters and ulcers on the cervixvaginal discharge in women pain passing urine a general feeling of being unwell, with aches, pains and flu-like symptoms These symptoms may last up to 20 days, but the sores will eventually scab and heal without scarring.Although the initial symptoms of genital herpes clear up, the virus remains dormant.It can be reactivated, causing recurrences, which are usually shorter and less severe.

as he did, General MacArthur's words will live on. General MacArthur's service to his country spanned  the years from
1903, when he was graduated from the Military Academy, to 5 April 1964 , when he
died in Washington, D.C., at the age of 84. He was recognized early in his
career as a brilliant officer and was advanced to brigadier general in 1918. Twelve years later he was named Chief of Staff of the Army, and in 1937 he
retired. Recalled to active duty during World War II, he was commander of the
Southwest Pacific Area during the greater part of the war. His wartime triumphs
were followed by service as supreme commander of the Allied occupation forces in
Japan. When the Korean conflict erupted, he also commanded the United Nations
forces in Korea. He completed his active military service in 1951. Before being laid to rest in Norfolk, Va., General MacArthur's body lay
in state in New York City and in the Capitol rotunda in Washington, while a
grateful Nation paid its tribute in sorrow. Duty, Honor, Country

 No human being could fail to be deeply moved by such a tribute as this
[Thayer Award]. Coming from a profession I have served so long and a people I
have loved so well, it fills me with an emotion I cannot express. But this
award is not intended primarily to honor a personality, but to symbolize a great
moral code-a code of conduct and chivalry of those who guard this beloved land
of culture and ancient descent. For all hours and for all time, it is an
expression of the ethics of the American soldier. That I should be integrated
in this way with so noble an ideal arouses a sense of pride, and yet of
humility, which will be with me always. Duty, honor, country:  Those three hallowed words reverently dictate what
you ought to be, what you can be, what you will be. They are your rallying
point to build courage when courage seems to fail, to regain faith when there
seems to be little cause for faith, to create hope when hope becomes forlorn. Unhappily, I possess neither that eloquence of diction, that poetry of
imagination, nor that brilliance of metaphor to tell you all that they mean. The unbelievers will say they are but words, but a slogan, but a flamboyant
phrase. Every pedant, every demagogue, every cynic, every hypocrite, every
troublemaker, and, I am sorry to say, some others of an entirely different
character, will try to downgrade them even to the extent of mockery and
ridicule. But these are some of the things they do. They build your basic character. They mold you for your future roles as the custodians of the Nation's defense. They make you strong enough to know when you are weak, and brave enough to face
yourself when you are afraid. What the Words Teach

 They teach you to be proud and unbending in honest failure, but humble and
gentle in success; not to substitute words for actions, not to seek the path of
comfort, but to face the stress and spur of difficulty and challenge; to learn
to stand up in the storm, but to have compassion on those who fall; to master
yourself before you seek to master others; to have a heart that is clean, a goal
that is high; to learn to laugh, yet never forget how to weep; to reach into the
future, yet never neglect the past; to be serious, yet never to take yourself
too seriously; to be modest so that you will remember the simplicity of true
greatness, the open mind of true wisdom, the meekness of true strength. They give you a temperate will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of
the emotions, a freshness of the deep springs of life, a temperamental
predominance of courage over timidity, of an appetite for adventure over love of
ease. They create in your heart the sense of wonder, the unfailing hope of what
next, and joy and inspiration of life. They teach you in this way to be an
officer and a gentleman. And what sort of soldiers are those you are to lead? Are they reliable? Are they brave? Are they capable of victory? Their story is known to all of you. It is the story of the American
man-at-arms. My estimate of him was formed on the battlefield many, many years
ago, and has never changed. I regarded him then, as I regard him now, as one of
the world's noblest figures; not only as one of the finest military characters,
but also as one of the most stainless. His name and fame are the birthright of every American citizen. In his
youth and strength, his love and loyalty, he gave all that mortality can give. He needs no eulogy from me; or from any other man. He has written his own
history and written it in red on his enemy's breast. But when I think of his patience in adversity of his courage under fire and
of his modesty in victory, I am filled with an emotion of admiration I cannot
put into words. He belongs to history as furnishing one of the greatest
examples of successful patriotism. He belongs to posterity as the instructor of
future generations in the principles of liberty and freedom. He belongs to the
present, to us, by his virtues and by his achievements. Witness to the Fortitude

 In 20 campaigns, on a hundred battlefields, around a thousand camp fires, I
have witnessed that enduring fortitude, that patriotic self-abnegation, and that
invincible determination which have carved his statue in the hearts of his
people. From one end of the world to the other, he has drained deep the chalice of
courage. As I listened to those songs [of the glee club], in memory's eye I
could see those staggering columns of the first World War, bending under soggy
packs on many a weary march, from dripping dusk to drizzling dawn, slogging
ankle deep through the mire of shell-pocked roads to form grimly for the attack,
bule-lipped, covered with sludge and mud, chilled by the wind and rain, driving
home to their objective, and for many to the judgment seat of God. I do not know the dignity of their birth, but I do know the glory of their
death. They died, unquestioning, uncomplaining, with faith in their hearts, and
on their lips the hope that we would go on to victory. Always for them: Duty, honor, country. Always their blood, and sweat, and
tears, as we sought the way and the light and the truth. And 20 years after, on
the other side of the globe, again the filth of murky foxholes, the stench of
ghostly trenches, the slime of dripping dugouts, those boiling suns of
relentless heat, those torrential rains of devastating storms, the loneliness
and utter desolation of jungle trails, the bitterness of long separation from
those they loved and cherished, the deadly pestilence of tropical disease, the
horror of stricken areas of war. Swift and Sure Attack

 Their resolute and determined defense, their swift and sure attack, their
indomitable purpose, their complete and decisive victory - always through the
bloody haze of their last reverberating shot, the vision of gaunt, ghastly men,
reverently following your password of duty, honor, country. The code which those words perpetuate embraces the highest moral law and
will stand the test of any ethics or philosophies ever promulgated for the
things that are right and its restraints are from the things that are wrong. The soldier, above all other men, is required to practice the greatest act of
religious training--sacrifice. In battle, and in the face of danger and death,
he discloses those divine attributes which his Maker gave when He created man in
His own image. No physical courage and no greater strength can take the place
of the divine help which alone can sustain him. However hard the incidents of
war may be, the soldier who is called upon to offer and to give his life for his
country is the noblest development of mankind. You now face a new world, a world of change. The thrust into outer space
of the satellite, spheres, and missiles marks a beginning of another epoch in
the long story of mankind. In the five or more billions of years the scientists
tell us it has taken to form the earth, in the three or more billion years of
development of the human race, there has never been a more abrupt or staggering
evolution. We deal now, not with things of this world alone, but with the illimitable
distances and as yet unfathomed mysteries of the universe. We are reaching out
for a new and boundless frontier. We speak in strange terms of harnessing the
cosmic energy, of making winds and tides work for us, of creating unheard of
synthetic materials to supplement or even replace our old standard basics; to
purify sea water for our drink; of mining ocean floors for new fields of wealth
and food; of disease preventatives to expand life into the hundred of years; of
controlling the weather for a more equitable distribution of heat and cold, of
rain and shine; of spaceships to the moon; of the primary target in war, no
longer limited to the armed forces of an enemy, but instead to include his civil
populations; of ultimate conflict between a united human race and the sinister
forces of some other planetary galaxy; of such dreams and fantasies as to make
life the most exciting of all times. And through all this welter of change and development your mission remains
fixed, determined, inviolable. It is to win our wars. Everything else in your
professional career is but corollary to this vital dedication. All other public
purposes, all other public projects, all other public needs, great or small,
will find others for their accomplishment; but you are the ones who are trained
to fight. The Profession of Arms

 Yours is the profession of arms, the will to win, the sure knowledge that
in war there is no substitute for victory, that if you lose, the Nation will be
destroyed, that the very obsession of your public service must be duty, honor,
country. Others will debate the controversial issues, national and international,
which divide men's minds. But serene, calm, aloof, you stand as the Nation's
war guardian, as its lifeguard from the raging tides of international conflict,
as its gladiator in the arena of battle. For a century and a half you have
defended, guarded, and protected its hallowed traditions of liberty and freedom,
of right and justice. Let civilian voices argue the merits or demerits of our processes of
government:  Whether our strength is being sapped by deficit financing indulged
in too long, by Federal paternalism grown too mighty, by power groups grown too
arrogant, by politics grown too corrupt, by crime grown too rampant, by morals
grown too low, by taxes grown too high, by extremists grown too violent; whether
our personal liberties are as thorough and complete as they should be. These great national problems are not for your professional participation
or military solution. Your guidepost stands out like a ten-fold beacon in the
night:  Duty, honor, country. You are the leaven which binds together the entire fabric of our national
system of defense. From your ranks come the great captains who hold the
Nation's destiny in their hands the moment the war tocsin sounds. The long, gray line has never failed us. Were you to do so, a million
ghosts in olive drab, in brown khaki, in blue and gray, would rise from their
white crosses, thundering those magic words: Duty, honor, country. Prays for Peace

 This does not mean that you are warmongers. On the contrary, the soldier
above all other people prays for peace, for he must suffer and bear the deepest
wounds and scars of war. But always in our ears ring the ominous words of
Plato, that wisest of all philosophers: ""Only the dead have seen the end of
war."" The shadows are lengthening for me. The twilight is here. My days of old
have vanished--tone and tint. They have gone glimmering through the dreams of
things that were. Their memory is one of wondrous beauty, watered by tears and
coaxed and caressed by the smiles of yesterday. I listen vainly, but with
thirsty ear, for the witching melody of faint bugles blowing reveille, of far
drums beating the long roll. In my dreams I hear again the crash of guns, the rattle of musketry, the
strange, mournful mutter of the battlefield. But in the evening of my memory
always I come back to West Point. Always there echoes and re-echoes: Duty,
honor, country. Today marks my final roll call with you. But I want you to know that when
I cross the river, my last conscious thoughts will be of the corps, and the
corps, and the corps. I bid you farewell. The text of this speech is reproduced from Department of Defense

Founded to test tactics, techniques, procedures and equipment, HMX-1 has since then, become synonymous with helicopter transport of the President of the United States.In 1957, rotary wing movement of the President, Vice President, and other important personnel originated, as President Dwight D. Eisenhower – away on vacation – was urgently needed back at the White House. What would have been a two hour motorcade trip was reduced to a seven minute helicopter ride. On that day, HMX-1 earned its most prestigious of missions – direct support of the President.In addition to Presidential and VIP support, the “Nighthawks” of HMX-1 maintains the role as the primary Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) unit for Marine assault support helicopters and related equipment. Indeed, the same pilots and aircrew supporting the President are often testing and evaluating aircraft and systems used by the Fleet Marine Forces. HMX-1 aircraft and Marines also support the Marine Corps Combat Development Command in the development of helicopter tactics, techniques and landing force equipment, as well as for student demonstrations and helicopter indoctrination.

Many individuals are incidentally exposed to secondhand cannabis smoke, but little is known about the effects of this exposure. This report examines the physiological, subjective, and behavioral/cognitive effects of secondhand cannabis exposure, and the influence of room ventilation on these effects.MethodsNon-cannabis-using individuals were exposed to secondhand cannabis smoke from six individuals smoking cannabis (11.3% THC) ad libitum in a specially constructed chamber for one hour. Chamber ventilation was experimentally manipulated so that participants were exposed under unventilated conditions or with ventilation at a rate of 11 air exchanges/hour. Physiological, subjective and behavioral/cognitive measures of cannabis exposure assessed after exposure sessions were compared to baseline measures.ResultsExposure to secondhand cannabis smoke under unventilated conditions produced detectable cannabinoid levels in blood and urine, minor increases in heart rate, mild to moderate self-reported sedative drug effects, and impaired performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST). One urine specimen tested positive at using a 50 ng/mL cut-off and several specimens were positive at 20 ng/mL. Exposure under ventilated conditions resulted in much lower blood cannabinoid levels, and did not produce sedative drug effects, impairments in performance, or positive urine screen results.ConclusionsRoom ventilation has a pronounced effect on exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke. Under extreme, unventilated conditions, secondhand cannabis smoke exposure can produce detectable levels of THC in blood and urine, minor physiological and subjective drug effects, and minor impairment on a task requiring psychomotor ability and working memory.Keywords: Cannabis, Marijuana, THC, Exposure, Secondhand, Cognitive1. INTRODUCTIONCannabis is the most widely used illicit drug globally ( World Health Organization, 2014 ). The most popular route of administration is smoking, which often occurs indoors, in automobiles, or in other areas where ventilation is limited or variable. Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive component of cannabis, is present in both mainstream smoke (inhaled by the user) and sidestream smoke (dispersed into environment; Cone et al., 1987 ; Fehr and Kalant, 1972 ; Matthais et al., 1997 ). Metabolism of THC yields the psychoactive metabolite, 11-hydroxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (11-OH-THC), which is present in blood after active or passive exposure to cannabis smoke ( Huestis et al., 1992 ; Moore et al., 2011 ). THC and 11-OH-THC have similar behavioral effects, but 11-OH-THC levels peak later than THC levels after cannabis exposure ( Hollister and Gillespie, 1975 ; Huestis et al., 1992 ; Järbe et al., 1994 ; Kosersky et al., 1974 ; Lemberger et al., 1973 ). Metabolism of 11-OH-THC yields 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH). THC-COOH is non-psychoactive, but its long half-life (~140 hours) makes it a common biomarker in urine testing for cannabis use.Many individuals are passively exposed to secondhand cannabis smoke given the current prevalence and patterns of cannabis use, however, there has been little controlled research examining the consequences of secondhand exposure. Most research on secondhand cannabis smoke exposure has focused on detection of cannabinoids (e.g., THC, 11-OH-THC, THC-COOH) in various biological matrices. Cone and Johnson (1986) exposed five healthy men to passive smoke from either 4 or 16 cannabis cigarettes (2.8% THC) in a small, enclosed room for one hour each day on six consecutive days. This secondhand smoke exposure reliably produced detectable levels of cannabinoids in urine and plasma, which varied in an orderly relation to dose (i.e., cannabinoid levels were higher after exposure to smoke from 16 cannabis cigarettes vs. 4 cigarettes). Similar results were obtained from studies using comparable designs (i.e., secondhand cannabis smoke exposure in small closed rooms or motor vehicles; Law et al., 1984 ; Mason et al., 1983 ; Mørland et al., 1985 ; Perez-Reyes et al., 1983 ).At least four limitations impede interpretation of these studies with regard to current real-world secondhand cannabis smoke exposure scenarios. First, exposure in these studies always occurred under the “extreme” conditions (i.e., in small spaces without ventilation). Because secondhand cannabis exposure in the real world occurs under conditions with different degrees of air ventilation (e.g., in rooms with air conditioning or open windows, or outdoors), research examining the effects of ventilation on exposure levels is needed. Second, the average potency of “street” cannabis has increased more than 3-fold in the time since these studies were conducted (sinsemilla cannabis seized from 2002–2008 by federal and state law enforcement agencies in the U.S. averaged 11.1% to 11.9% THC; Mehmedic et al., 2010 ). To our knowledge, only one controlled study has examined passive exposure to higher potency cannabis (10.4% THC) that more closely resembles street cannabis available today ( Niedbala et al., 2005 ). A more thorough examination of secondhand exposure using higher potency cannabis is needed to better model passive exposure to today’s cannabis and its potential effects on drug test results. Third, only one study has reported both physiological and subjective effects of secondhand cannabis exposure ( Cone and Johnson, 1986 ). Cone and Johnson (1986) reported that secondhand cannabis exposure had no systematic effects on heart rate or blood pressure, and that participant’s ratings of subjective drug effects increased significantly after exposure to smoke from 16 cannabis cigarettes relative to placebo ratings. These effects were most pronounced during the first hour after exposure, and resolved within three hours. Fourth, no prior studies have evaluated the effects of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure on behavioral/cognitive performance. Expanded research on the effects of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure in the areas outlined above is timely and warranted.The present study was conducted to examine the influence of variations in cannabis potency (5.3% THC vs. 11.3% THC) and in room ventilation (unventilated vs. standard residential ventilation) on the effects of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure. The primary objective of the study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of cannabinoids in various biological matrices following secondhand smoke exposure in order to inform federal workplace drug testing standards. A detailed report of the urine cannabinoid concentrations has been previously published ( Cone et al., 2015 ). Here, we report the outcomes of pharmacodynamic assessments, cannabinoid concentrations in whole blood, and provide a brief summary of the urine results. Data analysis was restricted to comparisons of the ventilated vs. unventilated sessions with the same potency of cannabis (11.3% THC) because over 40% more 11.3% THC cannabis was consumed than 5.3% THC cannabis (14.4 grams total vs. 10.2 grams total) in comparable (unventilated) study sessions. The different levels of cannabis consumption between these 2 conditions preclude our ability to validly compare the effects of cannabis potency on study outcomes, particularly pharmacodynamic measures. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate the effect of room ventilation on secondhand cannabis smoke exposure and is among the few secondhand cannabis smoke studies to examine pharmacodynamic outcomes or utilize cannabis with a potency that is representative of current “street” cannabis.2. METHODS2.1. Participants2.1.1. RecruitmentFrequent cannabis users and cannabis nonusers were recruited from the greater Baltimore, MD area via media advertising and word-of-mouth communication. Interested participants completed a screening session to determine eligibility. Participants provided written informed consent during the screening session. The Institutional Review Board at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine approved this study.2.1.2. SmokersCannabis users were eligible to participate as smokers if they: (1) were 18–45 years old, (2) reported using cannabis at least two times per week throughout the past 90 days, (3) provided a urine specimen that was positive for THC-COOH and negative for other drugs of abuse at screening and on the day of each study session, (4) had a negative breath alcohol reading at screening and on the day of each study session, (5) had a body mass index of 19–34 kg/m2, (6) were judged to be in good general heath based on physical examination, and (7) were not pregnant or nursing. Cannabis users were encouraged to participate in all three of the exposure sessions as a means of reducing between-session variability in smoke exposure among nonsmokers. Smokers were instructed to remain abstinent from cannabis overnight prior to exposure sessions.2.1.3. NonsmokersIndividuals who were not current cannabis users were eligible to participate in the study if they: (1) were 18–45 years old, (2) reported cannabis use at least once in their lifetime, but not within the prior 6 months, (3) provided a urine specimen that was negative for drugs of abuse at screening and on the day of study admission, (4) had a negative breath alcohol reading at screening and on the day of participation, (5) had a BMI ranging from 19–34 kg/m2, (6) were judged to be in good general heath based on a full physical examination, and (7) were not pregnant or nursing. Each nonsmoker participated in only one exposure session due to concern that residual effects of cannabis exposure in one session might influence results of subsequent sessions. Because the primary aim of this study was to examine the pharmacokinetic profile of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure, we restricted the nonsmoker group to individuals who were not current cannabis users so that they would not have residual cannabinoids in biological matrices (e.g., urine, saliva) at baseline.2.2. Experimental ProcedureThree secondhand cannabis exposure sessions were conducted at the Johns Hopkins University Bayview campus. The first session involved exposure to cannabis containing 5.3% THC in an unventilated environment, the second session involved exposure to cannabis containing 11.3% THC in an unventilated environment, and the third session involved exposure to cannabis containing 11.3% THC in a ventilated environment. We only describe results from the second and third sessions here.Smokers and non-smokers arrived at approximately 0700 hours on session days. Drug and alcohol testing was conducted upon arrival to confirm that participants still met study eligibility requirements regarding substance use. Smokers were reminded of abstinence requirements the day before each session took place, and study staff met with active smokers when they arrived on session days to check for signs of recent cannabis use (e.g., bloodshot eyes, odor of cannabis smoke) to verify reported abstinence. Nonsmokers were required to urine test negative for cannabis. Nursing staff placed an intravenous catheter in the non-dominant arm of each participant for repeated blood sampling. Tobacco and caffeine use was not permitted during study sessions. One nonsmoker was a daily tobacco user, and was provided with nicotine patches in order to reduce the potential effect of nicotine withdrawal on study outcomes.After completing baseline assessments, 6 cannabis smokers and 6 nonsmokers entered a specially constructed smoke exposure chamber (approximately 0900 hours). The chamber measured 10 ft. × 13 ft. (3.05 m × 3.96 m) with a 7 ft. (2.13 m) ceiling, was constructed using a combination of Plexiglas and aluminum support beams, and incorporated an adjustable ventilation/exhaust system. Smokers and nonsmokers sat around a table in alternating seats. All participants wore protective clothing over their normal clothes (disposable booties, jumpsuits) during the exposure session, and were provided with swimming goggles to prevent eye irritation from accumulated smoke.During the unventilated exposure session, ducts at both the intake and exhaust manifolds of the chamber were capped, eliminating the inflow/outflow of air. During the ventilated session a central air conditioning unit fed cool air through a 9.5 in2 (24 cm2) intake register at one end of the chamber. On the opposite end, air was exhausted through a 9.5 in2 (24 cm2) register into a ventilation shaft that contained a motorized fan. The ventilation system was calibrated to achieve an airflow rate of 11 air-exchanges/hour, which is consistent with residential ventilation standards based on the size of the chamber. Other than the differences in ventilation and select study participants, both session protocols were identical.Each smoker was provided with 10 cannabis cigarettes obtained from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Drug Supply Program and a CReSS Pocket smoking topography device (Borgwaldt KC, Richmond, VA, USA). Each cannabis cigarette contained approximately 1 gram of high potency (11.3% THC) cannabis. The door to the chamber was sealed using magnetic strips around the frame of the door at the start of each 60-minute exposure session. Active smokers were instructed to smoke the provided cannabis cigarettes ad libitum through the CReSS device, which measured the number of puffs taken, puff volume, and other parameters of smoking behavior. Participants were instructed to remain seated for the entirety of the session, but were allowed to engage in leisure activities (e.g., talking, reading, using personal electronic devices, etc.). Research staff monitored the exposure session from outside the chamber to ensure nonsmokers did not actively inhale from the cannabis cigarettes and that smokers only consumed cigarettes from their own supply. Pulse oximeters were used to monitor blood oxygen concentration of study participants every 15 minutes to ensure an adequate oxygen supply was maintained in the chamber.After 60 minutes the door to the exposure chamber was opened; participants then exited the chamber, immediately discarded protective clothing, and washed their hands and face to minimize contamination of biological samples collected after exposure. Participants then proceeded to a large room where they completed study assessments at regular intervals for 8 hours post-exposure among smokers and 34 hours post-exposure among non-smokers.2.3. Assessments2.3.1. Measures of cannabis exposureThe total weight of cannabis cigarettes, including butts and loose plant material, was obtained for each participant prior to and immediately after each session to determine the amount of cannabis combusted. We examined CReSS data on total puff volume to assess temporal characteristics of cannabis consumption. Biological samples (blood, urine, saliva, hair) were obtained for 8-hours post exposure among smokers and for up to 34 hours among nonsmokers. Whole blood specimens (10 mL) were obtained from indwelling venous catheters using grey-top vacutainer blood collection tubes at baseline, immediately after exiting the smoke chamber (Time “0”) and 0.5 (30 minutes), 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 22, 26, 30, and 34 hours after exposure. Spot urine specimens were collected hourly for the first 4 hours and then pooled specimens were obtained for hours 6–8, 8–10, 10–12, 12–22, 22–26, 26–30, and 30–34. Quantitative testing for cannabinoids (THC, 11-OH-THC, THC-COOH) in whole blood was conducted by Immunalysis Corp (Pomona, CA) using LC/MS/MS, with a 0.5 ng/mL limit of quantitation. Urinalysis testing for THC-COOH was performed by Clinical Reference Laboratory (Lenexa, KS) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) with cut-offs of both 20 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL and confirmatory GS/MS with a 0.75 ng/mL limit of quantitation (see Cone et al., 2015 ).2.3.2. Physiological AssessmentsHeart rate (BPM) and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mm/hg) were measured using automated monitors while participants were in the seated position at baseline, immediately after exiting the smoke exposure chamber (Time “0”), and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 22, 26, 30, and 34 hours post-exposure.2.3.3. Self-Report AssessmentsParticipants completed a 15-item Drug Effect Questionnaire (DEQ) to assess subjective ratings of drug effects. Individual items on the DEQ included three ratings of drug effects (“do you feel a drug effect?,” “do you feel a pleasant drug effect?,” “do you feel an unpleasant drug effect?”) and twelve ratings of behavioral/mood states often associated with cannabis intoxication (“sick”, “heart racing”, “anxious”, “relaxed”, “paranoid”, “tired”, “alert”, “irritable”, “vigorous”, “restless”, “hungry/have munchies”, “craving cannabis”). Participants rated each item using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) anchored with “not at all” on one end and “extremely” on the other. The DEQ was administered at baseline and at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 22, 26, 30, and 34 hours post-exposure.2.3.4. Behavioral/Cognitive AssessmentsParticipants completed three different computerized behavioral tasks to assess aspects of psychomotor/cognitive performance known to be sensitive to the acute effects of smoked cannabis and relevant to functioning in the workplace and/or operating a motor vehicle or heavy machinery ( Hooker and Jones, 1987 ; Wilson et al., 1994 ). Study participants completed each task three times during the screening visit while under the supervision of study staff in order to ensure proper understanding and minimize the influence of practice effects on task performance during the study, and were administered at baseline and at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 hours post-exposure.2.3.4.1. Divided Attention Task (DAT; Casswell and Marks, 1973 )On this task, participants simultaneously tracked a central stimulus and monitored peripheral stimuli. The central stimulus was a diamond that moved back and forth horizontally across the computer screen. Participants were instructed to track this stimulus using the computer mouse while monitoring a target digit at the lower center of the computer screen. Peripheral stimuli were digits (1–9) that appeared in each of the four corners of the screen. Participants were instructed to click the computer mouse once each time one of the digits in the corners of the screen matched the target digit. Task duration was 6 minutes. Primary outcomes on the DAT are the number of correct peripheral targets identified, reaction time (milliseconds) on correct responses, and mean distance (number of pixels) of cursor from the central stimulus.2.3.4.2. Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST; McLeod et al., 1982 )On this task, participants viewed a series of nine geometric patterns. Each pattern was numbered (1–9) and consisted of three highlighted squares on a 3×3 grid. When the number associated with a particular pattern appeared on the center of the screen, participants were instructed to replicate the shape of that pattern using the an assigned 3×3 section of the computer keyboard. Task duration was 90 seconds. Primary outcomes of the DSST were total number of trials attempted, total number correct, and percentage of attempted trials completed correctly.2.3.4.3. Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT; Gronwall et al., 1977 )On this task, participants were presented with a string of single digit integers on the computer screen. Participants were instructed to calculate the sum of each successive pair of integers presented and select the correct answer from a list of choices displayed on the screen using the computer mouse. These integers appeared on the screen every 2.8 seconds during the initial battery of 30 trials. Following a 30 second break, integers appeared every 2.4 seconds during the second battery of 60 additional trials. Task duration was 5 minutes. Primary outcomes on the PASAT were total number of trials correct, and reaction time (milliseconds) on correct items.2.4. Data AnalysisDemographic variables were compared between smokers and nonsmokers, and between nonsmokers in unventilated and ventilated sessions using independent-samples t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. We limited analyses to the time window when subjective and behavioral/cognitive effects were likely to be observed because of the abundance of zero or near-zero blood cannabinoids levels and subjective drug effect ratings at later post-exposure time points. To select this window, we plotted levels of THC and of 11-OH-THC in whole blood at baseline and during the first four hours post-exposure to examine total intoxicant exposure during the post-exposure timeframe when effects are typically present. Blood cannabinoid levels peaked immediately after exposure and declined to below the level of quantitation by 90 minutes post-exposure among nonsmokers. DEQ ratings of “feel drug effect” appeared to parallel changes in blood cannabinoid levels among both smokers and nonsmokers (see Figure 1 ). Consequently, we limited outcome analyses of physiological, subjective, and behavioral/cognitive effects to the first hour after cannabis exposure.Figure 1Whole blood THC levels, whole blood 11-OH-THC levels, heart rate (BPM) and DEQ visual analog scale ratings (VAS, 0–100) of “feel drug effect” among smokers and nonsmokers in unventilated and ventilated study conditions. Error bars ...We fit mixed effects regression models ( Gueorguieva and Krystal, 2004 ) to assess differences between baseline and the first hour post-exposure for each measure. This model allowed us to compare the mean difference between baseline values and post-exposure values while accounting for (1) within-subject variability among post-exposure time points collected during the first hour after exposure within each session, and (2) between-session variability among baseline measures and post-exposure measures for the five active smokers who completed both exposure sessions. Data from active smokers who participated in multiple sessions were analyzed together and are presented together because their levels of cannabinoid exposure did not significantly differ as a function of room ventilation (see Figure 1 ). The absence of significant effects of cannabis exposure on heart rate among active smokers using mixed effects regression models that included data from the first hour post exposure prompted follow up comparisons between heart rate at baseline and heart rate at Time 0 using a second set of mixed effects regression models in order to examine if any transient effects on heart rate were present in smokers and in nonsmokers. Smokers and nonsmokers were not compared. Data on smokers are presented to serve as a reference for evaluating the levels of biological exposure and corresponding drug effects among nonsmokers. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and significance was determined at p < 0.05.3. RESULTS3.1. ParticipantsTable 1 shows demographics of the nineteen participants (7 smokers and 12 nonsmokers) who completed the high potency (11.3% THC) unventilated and ventilated sessions of the study. Seven smokers were included in analyses because one of the original six participants who completed the unventilated session withdrew from the study and was replaced. There were no significant differences between these groups on any of the variables examined.Demographic characteristics among smokers, nonsmokers in the unventilated session, nonsmokers in the ventilated session. Average grams of cannabis consumed per study session among smokers.3.2. Exposure Session ConditionsSmokers consumed a considerable amount of cannabis in both the unventilated (14.4 grams total) and ventilated (16.5 grams total) exposure sessions. The chamber was visibly very smoky during the unventilated session (became difficult to see through to the opposing wall clearly; see Figure 2 in Cone et al., 2015 ). Cannabis smoke was visible during the ventilated session, but it did not obstruct chamber transparency. CReSS data were available for 10/12 smoking bouts (one CReSS device malfunctioned in the unventilated session and the battery died for one unit during the ventilated session). Data on puff volume indicated that smokers consumed 34% less cannabis during the second 30 minutes of the exposure period than during the first 30 minutes. Participants tolerated both study sessions well, with some complaints of mild eye irritation during the unventilated session, mainly among participants who did not wear or removed their protective eye goggles.3.3. Effects of Cannabis Exposure on Cannabinoid Levels in Blood and Urine3.3.1. SmokersFigure 1 shows mean blood THC levels, blood 11-OH-THC levels, heart rate, and ratings of “feel drug effect” among smokers and nonsmokers at baseline and during the first four hours after exposure. All smokers had detectible levels of THC (mean 4.5 ng/ml) and 11-OH-THC (mean 2.4 ng/ml) at baseline, though all reported overnight abstinence and did not show any evidence of recent cannabis use (e.g., cannabis odor, bloodshot eyes). Blood levels of THC and 11-OH-THC peaked immediately following exposure in both sessions (means of 20.7 ng/ml and 5.6 ng/ml, respectively), and returned to baseline within 4 hours.3.3.2. Nonsmokers3.3.2.1. Unventilated SessionNone of the nonsmokers in the unventilated session had detectable blood cannabinoids at baseline, but all six had detectible levels of THC following secondhand smoke exposure. Levels peaked immediately following exposure (Time 0 mean = 3.2 ng/ml), and remained detectible (>0.5 ng/mL) for 1–3 hours post-exposure. Only one participant had detectible levels of 11-OH-THC following exposure. One urine specimen tested positive in accordance with federal drug testing guidelines (screen with ELISA >50 ng/ml THC-COOH and confirmed with GC/MS >15 ng/ml THC-COOH) 4 hours post-exposure. Using a lower cut-off that is common in some commercial drug testing programs (ELISA >20 ng/ml THC-COOH; GC/MS > 15 ng/mL), 4 of 6 nonsmokers produced urine samples that screened and confirmed positive with a window of detection that ranged from 2 to 22 hours post-exposure.3.3.2.2. Ventilated SessionNone of the nonsmokers in the ventilated session had detectable blood cannabinoids at baseline. Four of the six nonsmokers had detectible levels of blood cannabinoids immediately following exposure. These levels were lower than those observed in the unventilated session (Time 0 mean = 0.7 ng/ml), and were not detectable after Time 0. None of these participants had detectible levels of 11-OH-THC following exposure. No urine samples collected from nonsmokers in the ventilated session screened positive, even using the lower (ELISA >20 ng/ml) cut-off level.3.4. Physiological Effects3.4.1. SmokersTable 2 shows detailed outcomes and results from analyses comparing baseline values to values from the first hour post-exposure for physiological, subjective, and behavioral/cognitive study measures. No significant effects on heart rate were observed using the mixed effects regression model that compared baseline to the first hour post exposure (see Table 2 ). Follow-up analyses that compared baseline heart rate to heart rate at Time 0 indicated no main effect of ventilation condition [beta = 1.21 (SEM = 3.33), p = 0.72], a significant main effect of time, [beta = 10.00 (SEM = 3.20) p = .002), and no ventilation condition by time interaction [beta = −4.83 (SEM = 4.53), p = 0 .29]. These results indicate that heart rate was significantly higher at Time 0 compared with baseline (heart rate increased from 66.8 BPM vs. 76.8 BPM in the unventilated session, and 70.0 BPM vs. 75.2 BPM in the ventilated session following cannabis exposure) and that there was no statistically significantly difference in the effect of time on heart rate between the unventilated and ventilated conditions. A modest but statistically significant reduction in systolic blood pressure was observed after cannabis use among smokers (see Table 2 ). No effect on diastolic blood pressure was observed.Physiological, subjective, and behavioral/cognitive measures among smokers in both sessions, nonsmokers in the unventilated session, and nonsmokers in the ventilated session at the baseline assessment (pre) and the average of assessments during the first ...3.4.2. Nonsmokers3.4.2.1. Unventilated SessionNo significant effect on heart rate was observed with the initial fixed effect regression model comparing baseline heart rate to heart rate during the first hour post exposure (see Table 2 ). Follow up analyses comparing baseline heart rate to heart rate at Time 0 indicated a small, but statistically significant increase in heart rate [65.7 BPM vs. 71.7 BPM, beta = 6.00 (SEM = 2.78) p = 0.03]. There was a non-significant trend toward increased systolic blood pressure following exposure and no effect on diastolic blood pressure (see Table 2 ).3.4.2.2. Ventilated SessionNo significant effects on heart rate or blood pressure were observed (see Table 2 ).3.5. Subjective Effects3.5.1. SmokersRatings of “drug effect,” “pleasant drug effect,” “relaxed,” “vigorous,” and “hungry/have munchies” were significantly higher than baseline during the hour following cannabis exposure. Craving for cannabis was significantly lower than baseline during this period. All of these effects resolved (i.e., returned to baseline) within 4 hours.3.5.2. Nonsmokers3.5.2.1. Unventilated SessionRatings of “drug effect,” “pleasant drug effect,” “tired,” and “hungry/have munchies” were significantly higher than baseline during the hour post exposure. Ratings of “alert” and “vigorous” were significantly lower. These effects resolved within 1.5 hours post exposure.3.5.2.2. Ventilated sessionRatings of “hungry/have munchies” increased significantly from baseline during the first hour post exposure. No other subjective ratings showed significant changes.3.6. Behavioral/Cognitive Effects3.6.1. SmokersAverage cursor distance from target increased significantly from baseline during the first hour post exposure on the DAT, indicating decreased tracking accuracy. Performance did not differ from baseline on any other measures examined.3.6.2. Nonsmokers3.6.2.1. Unventilated sessionThe number of DSST patterns attempted increased significantly from baseline during the hour post-exposure, but the percentage of attempted patterns that were completed correctly decreased significantly. There were no significant changes in total number correct on the DSST or performance on the DAT or PASAT.3.6.2.2. Ventilated sessionThe number of DSST patterns attempted and the number completed correctly increased significantly from baseline during the hour post exposure without a change in percent correct. Total number correct on the PASAT also increased significantly from baseline. Reaction time on the PASAT did not change, nor did performance on the DAT.4. DISCUSSIONThis report describes the first study of which we are aware to examine the influence of room ventilation on secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke, and the first study to examine the effects of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure on behavioral/cognitive performance. Exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke in an unventilated chamber the size of a small room produced minor increases in heart rate, mild to moderate subjective drug effects, and minor, but detectible, levels of performance impairment on some behavioral/cognitive assessments. The time course of these effects paralleled the levels of psychoactive cannabinoids in blood and was followed by detectable levels of THC-COOH in urine. The THC-COOH concentration in one specimen was sufficient to trigger a positive urine drug screen at a cut-off of >50 ng/ml (i.e., the cut-off recommended for use by the SAMHSA mandatory guidelines for federal workplace drug testing programs), and multiple positive urine results were observed for four participants using a more stringent cut-off of >20 ng/ml, which is used by some commercial/private workplace drug testing programs, within a day of exposure. Ventilating the exposure chamber in a manner that approximated standard residential heating or air conditioning units dramatically reduced levels of exposure among nonsmokers, evidenced by much lower (in some cases undetectable) levels of cannabinoids in blood and urine and the absence of subjective and behavioral/cognitive effects.We observed some notable patterns in subjective drug effects. First, the effects reported by nonsmokers in the unventilated condition were small in magnitude and predominantly sedative in nature (increased ratings of “tired” decreased ratings of “alert” and “vigorous”). In contrast, the subjective effects reported by active smokers were larger in magnitude and not exclusively sedative (increases in both “relaxed” and “vigorous”). Differential effects after smoking high-potency cannabis (9.75% and 23.12% THC) have been reported elsewhere in the literature (e.g., decreases in both “alertness” and in “calmness”; Hunault et al., 2014 ). Second, although absolute levels were low, the rise and fall of blood cannabinoid levels observed in nonsmokers following exposure in the unventilated condition paralleled the time course of subjective effects. Because nonsmokers in the ventilated condition did not report subjective drug effects, it is unlikely that the subjective intoxication reported by nonsmokers after the unventilated session was the result of social contagion, since nonsmoking participants were around equivalently-intoxicated active smokers during both study sessions while assessments were being completed. Furthermore, in a prior study of controlled smoked cannabis in our laboratory, subjective drug effects remained elevated from baseline an hour after exposure, while mean plasma THC levels had returned to baseline (about 7 ng/mL) ( Milman et al., 2014 ; Vandrey et al., 2013 ). Indeed, blood cannabinoid concentrations typically peak immediately after inhalation and degrade rapidly, and do not necessarily reflect levels of intoxication (see Hollister et al., 1981 ). However, the influence of expectancy effects resulting from the smokiness of the chamber in the unventilated session was not controlled for, may have affected results, and should be considered when interpreting these outcomes.Nonsmokers in the ventilated session did not have detectable levels of cannabinoids in blood beyond the initial 30 minutes following the exposure period, did not screen positive on urine tests, and did not report significant increases in subjective drug effects except for “hungry/have munchies.” Because this increase did not correspond with any other ratings of drug effect, we interpret the increase in hunger as unrelated to cannabis exposure (lunch hour was approaching). These findings suggest that ventilation dramatically reduces secondhand smoke exposure, even when large quantities of cannabis (~16.5 grams) are smoked in relatively small spaces in a short amount of time. Although room ventilation reduced levels of exposure among nonsmokers, ventilation appeared to have very little effect on levels of cannabinoids in blood or subjective effects among smokers. Smokers consumed an average of 2.6 grams of cannabis each through active smoking, thus, the comparatively small amounts of THC absorbed passively by smokers in the unventilated condition were likely not sufficient to produce additional effects.The finding that exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke under extreme unventilated conditions can produce minor, but detectible impairments in performance on a task that measures psychomotor ability and working memory is novel. Passive exposure increased speed of responding but decreased accuracy, reflecting speed-accuracy trade-offs that are consistent with the effects of THC on behavioral/cognitive performance observed among infrequent cannabis users (e.g., Curran et al., 2002 ). In addition, individuals in the ventilated session showed post-exposure increases in both speed and accuracy on the DSST, and increases in accuracy on the PASAT. The lack of such practice effects among individuals in the unventilated condition may be further evidence of impaired performance, but that cannot be determined with confidence based on the design and small sample size of the present study.Interestingly, although smokers consumed large quantities of cannabis, had increased blood cannabinoid levels, and reported moderate to high levels of subjective effects, the expected increase in heart rate commonly associated with cannabis use was relatively small and only very minor signs of decreased performance on one measure of behavioral/cognitive performance (i.e., the DAT) were observed. This may reflect pharmacodynamic tolerance, as all of the active smokers were chronic heavy cannabis users. It is also possible that larger effects on heart rate and performance were missed. Smokers consumed cannabis over a 60-minute time period, and consumed 34% less cannabis during the second 30 minutes of the exposure period than during the first 30 minutes. Thus, it is possible that more robust physiological changes occurred and smokers were impaired during the exposure period, but this impairment resolved prior to post-exposure testing. The effects of cannabis smoking on heart rate may resolve within 45 minutes of smoking ( Vandrey et al., 2013 ; Cooper and Haney, 2014 ), and heart rate was assessed 30, 60, and 90 minutes after many of the active smokers had ceased intensive smoking. The fact that significant differences in heart rate were observed among smokers when comparing baseline to Time 0, but not when comparing baseline to the first hour post exposure suggests that any effects on heart rate were transient. Although acute THC has been shown to reliably produce cognitive/working memory impairment (see Ranganathan and D’Souza, 2006 for review), many of these studies recruited infrequent or moderate cannabis users. Heavier users may show little if any impairment ( Ramaekers et al., 2009 ). Alternatively, the absence of observed cognitive effects may be the result of acute tolerance within study sessions. Additional research evaluating the effects of cannabis on working memory with infrequent users as smokers utilizing the current study procedure would help with interpretation of these results.The results of this study must be considered in light of its limitations. First, we did not conduct a placebo exposure session (i.e., session where cannabis devoid of THC was smoked), making it impossible to determine whether the subjective and behavioral/cognitive effects observed among active smokers and among nonsmokers in the unventilated session were the result of THC exposure or of expectancy. The design of this study would make a placebo session difficult, as active smokers would likely recognize 0% THC cannabis as placebo during the study session. Thus, it would be unlikely they would smoke sufficient quantities, and likely that they would be vocal about the absence of drug effects during the study session, thereby unblinding nonsmokers. There were a relatively small number of participants in each study session, and all participants were exposed to cannabis smoke and completed assessments simultaneously in the same laboratory room. As a result, it is possible that subjective and behavioral/cognitive effects reported by non-smokers may have been influenced by suggestibility or study demand characteristics. However, the finding that nonsmokers in the ventilated session did not show any drug effects, and that the effects observed among nonsmokers in the unventilated session closely paralleled levels of cannabinoids in blood indicate these effects may be the result of passively-absorbed THC. In addition, the experimental conditions created here do not reflect the full spectrum of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure scenarios that occur outside of the laboratory, and should not be interpreted to reflect normative conditions. This study models two scenarios of acute exposure in an enclosed room. The size of room, amount of cannabis consumed, duration of exposure, and frequency of such exposure are all variables that likely would influence outcomes in the real world. That said, several study participants reported previous secondhand exposure experiences that resembled the unventilated study condition, which indicates our exposure model has some degree of ecological validity. Furthermore, testing the effects of passive exposure among a balanced sample of women and men should be regarded as a strength because it speaks to the generality of our results.In conclusion, this study indicates that absorption of cannabinoids can result from secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke. Room ventilation had a significant impact on the degree of cannabinoid absorption and on resultant pharmacodynamic effects. Nonsmokers exposed under unventilated conditions reported low to moderate levels of sedative drug effects that corresponded with minor impairment in cognitive performance, while nonsmokers exposed under ventilated conditions reported no significant subjective effects and did not have impairment in cognitive performance. These results suggest that extreme conditions like those examined in this study may result in biological exposure sufficient to produce measureable subjective effects, decreases in behavioral/cognitive performance, and could produce a positive drug test result within a short window of time following exposure.​Exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke results in absorption of cannabinoids.Secondhand exposure can produce mild subjective and behavioral/cognitive effectsRoom ventilation ameliorates the effects of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure.AcknowledgmentsRole of Funding SourceFunding for this project was provided by SAMHSA.

I am not a doctor or a scientist or a chemist. I just don’t want what happened to my daughter to happen to anyone else.If you have elementary age kids, you are probably familiar with the current slime obsession. My daughter and her friends became obsessed with it a few months ago and couldn’t get enough of it. So much so that they decided they would start making it themselves at home, a simple endeavor providing you have the right ingredients.Basically, homemade slime consists of:BoraxShaving CreamFood Coloring (optional)You might have also heard how stores can’t even keep enough glue in stock. True story… we had a horrible time finding Elmer’s Glue at our local Walmart, Hobby Lobby and Target.There are variations of the above for sure, but these ingredients are what my daughter and her friends were using to create their slime.We are a pretty healthy family. We get our flu shots each year and my kids have never had strep or flu or bronchial illnesses. They have never had more than your basic cold that lasted a few days. When my 12 year old got sick, we thought it was the same basic cold. Symptoms were the same: cough, sore throat, stuffy nose. She was also complaining about headaches and general achiness. Assuming her symptoms would be relieved in a few days, we didn’t pay them much mind. Unfortunately, they didn’t go away. At all. Weeks later, we were still left wondering what on earth was going on. To the doctor we went. We had her take a throat culture, check her lungs, and ears and sinuses. She found nothing. Other than your basic cold symptoms, there wasn’t anything wrong with her on the surface.You know how as a parent you just kind of the get the feeling that there is more to something than meets the eye? My husband was actually the one who connected the dots. He told me one night, “Do you think it could have something to do with the slime she’s been making?”It was like a lightbulb went off. It kind of made sense all of a sudden. From that moment, we banned her from making, holding, touching or even looking at that darn slime.The very next day, her headache went away. Her throat didn’t hurt anymore. She still had some congestion, but wasn’t coughing. Two days later, the congestion started going away. She was breathing better and talking better. No more achiness.What the what??? Could the homemade slime have been poisoning my daughter?Then this article started to make it around on some of my friends’ Facebook feeds: Schoolyard Slime Craze Risk to Children Says Experts .So I started to investigate a little more about what on earth my child was getting into. What I found out was disturbing.BORAX – From the website, CQ Concepts :Boric acid, sodium borate, and sodium perborate are estimated to have a fatal dose from 0.1 to 0.5g/kg. These substances are toxic to all cells, and have a slow excretion rate through the kidneys. Kidney toxicity is the greatest, with liver fatty degeneration, cerebral edema, and gastroenteritis. Boric acid solutions used as an eye wash or on abraded skin are known to be especially toxic to infants, especially after repeated use due to its slow elimination rate.GLUE – From the website, Mediline Plus :Symptoms of breathing in (“sniffing”) glue fumes may include:AnxietyConvulsions (from breathing in large amounts)Drunk, dazed, or dizzy appearanceExcitability	1
https://www.snopes.com/america-first-ku-klux-klan-slogan/	Was ‘America First’ a Slogan of the Ku Klux Klan?	true	['america first', ' coin', ' kkk', ' ku klux klan', ' political slogans', ' trump administration']	http://time.com/	http://time.com/4309786/read-donald-trumps-america-first-foreign-policy-speech/	2018/02/09	By Ryan Teague BeckwithUpdated: April 27, 2016 1:37 PM ETRepublican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump outlined an “America first” foreign policy approach in what was billed as a major address at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C.Here is a full transcript of the speech.Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you, and thank you to the Center for National Interest for honoring me with this invitation. It truly is a great honor. I’d like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country, one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace.TRUMP: It’s time to shake the rust off America’s foreign policy. It’s time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold, something we have to do. The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle. My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else. It has to be first. Has to be.That will be the foundation of every single decision that I will make. America…(APPLAUSE)America first will be the major and overriding theme of my administration. But to chart our path forward, we must first briefly take a look back. We have a lot to be proud of.In the 1940s we saved the world. The greatest generation beat back the Nazis and Japanese imperialists. Then we saved the world again. This time, from totalitarianism and communism. The Cold War lasted for decades but, guess what, we won and we won big. Democrats and Republicans working together got Mr. Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan, our great president, when he said, tear down this wall.(APPLAUSE)History will not forget what he did. A very special man and president. Unfortunately, after the Cold War our foreign policy veered badly off course. We failed to develop a new vision for a new time. In fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense. Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, which led to one foreign policy disaster after another.They just kept coming and coming. We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obama’s line in the sand in Syria. Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper. Very bad. It all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interests in becoming a western democracy.We tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed. Civil war, religious fanaticism, thousands of Americans and just killed be lives, lives, lives wasted. Horribly wasted. Many trillions of dollars were lost as a result. The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill. Iran, too, would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment.They have benefited so much, so sadly, for us. Our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster. No vision. No purpose. No direction. No strategy. Today I want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy.First, our resources are totally over extended. President Obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy. He’s crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders. Our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year.We’re rebuilding other countries while weakening our own. Ending the theft of American jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military, which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength. I am the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem.I’m the only one — believe me, I know them all, I’m the only one who knows how to fix it.(APPLAUSE)Secondly, our allies are not paying their fair share, and I’ve been talking about this recently a lot. Our allies must contribute toward their financial, political, and human costs, have to do it, of our tremendous security burden. But many of them are simply not doing so.TRUMP: They look at the United States as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us. In NATO, for instance, only 4 of 28 other member countries besides America, are spending the minimum required 2 percent of GDP on defense. We have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia.The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense, and if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves. We have no choice.(APPLAUSE)The whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security. A Trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded, and funded beautifully.Thirdly, our friends are beginning to think they can’t depend on us. We’ve had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies, something that we’ve never seen before in the history of our country. He negotiated a disastrous deal with Iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry. Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, cannot be allowed. Remember that, cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.(APPLAUSE)And under a Trump administration, will never, ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon.(APPLAUSE)All of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the United States with Iran’s treatment of our ten captured sailors — so vividly I remember that day. In negotiation, you must be willing to walk. The Iran deal, like so many of our worst agreements, is the result of not being willing to leave the table.When the other side knows you’re not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win — you just can’t win. At the same time, your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them. You’ve made that agreement, you have to stand by it and the world will be a better place. President Obama gutted our missile defense program and then abandoned our missile defense plans with Poland and the Czech Republic. He supported the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel, and then helped bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power in its place.Israel, our great friend and the one true democracy in the Middle East has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity. Just a few days ago, Vice President Biden again criticized Israel, a force for justice and peace, for acting as an impatient peace area in the region.President Obama has not been a friend to Israel. He has treated Iran with tender love and care and made it a great power. Iran has, indeed, become a great, great power in just a very short period of time, because of what we’ve done. All of the expense and all at the expense of Israel, our allies in the region and very importantly, the United States itself.We’ve picked fights with our oldest friends, and now they’re starting to look elsewhere for help. Remember that. Not good.Fourth, our rivals no longer respect us. In fact, they’re just as confused as our allies, but in an even bigger problem is they don’t take us seriously anymore. The truth is they don’t respect us. When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, to leader was there, nobody, to greet him.Perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One. Then amazingly, the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia. It’s called no respect. Absolutely no respect.TRUMP: Do you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to Copenhagen, Denmark, to get the Olympics for our country, and after this unprecedented effort, it was announced that the United States came in fourth — fourth place? The president of the United States making this trip — unprecedented — comes in fourth place. He should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment. We were laughed at all over the world, as we have been many, many times.The list of humiliations go on and on and on. President Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach. Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea. We have the leverage. We have the power over China, economic power, and people don’t understand it. And with that economic power, we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with North Korea, which is totally out of control.He has even allowed China to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engaged in industrial espionage against the United States and its companies. We’ve let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything, and they do. They do at will. It always happens. If President Obama’s goal had been to weaken America, he could not have done a better job.Finally, America no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals. Since the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union, we’ve lacked a coherent foreign policy. One day, we’re bombing Libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians. The next day, we’re watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart. Lives lost, massive moneys lost. The world is a different place.We’re a humanitarian nation, but the legacy of the Obama-Clinton interventions will be weakness, confusion and disarray, a mess. We’ve made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before. We left Christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide.(APPLAUSE)We have done nothing to help the Christians, nothing, and we should always be ashamed for that, for that lack of action. Our actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS, and we’re in a war against radical Islam, but President Obama won’t even name the enemy, and unless you name the enemy, you will never ever solve the problem.(APPLAUSE)Hillary Clinton also refuses to say the words radical Islam, even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country. After Secretary Clinton’s failed intervention in Libya, Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans. Then, instead of taking charge that night, Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep. Incredible.Clinton blames it all on a video, an excuse that was a total lie, proven to be absolutely a total lie. Our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state misled the nation. And, by the way, she was not awake to take that call at 3 o’clock in the morning. And now ISIS is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling Libya oil. And you know what? We don’t blockade, we don’t bomb, we don’t do anything about it. It’s almost as if our country doesn’t even know what’s happening, which could be a fact and could be true.TRUMP: This will all change when I become president.To our friends and allies, I say America is going to be strong again. America is going to be reliable again. It’s going to be a great and reliable ally again. It’s going to be a friend again. We’re going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon American interests and the shared interests of our allies.(APPLAUSE)We’re getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world. Our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water’s edge. We need a new rational American foreign policy, informed by the best minds and supported by both parties, and it will be by both parties — Democrats, Republicans, independents, everybody, as well as by our close allies.This is how we won the Cold War and it’s how we will win our new future struggles, which may be many, which may be complex, but we will win if I become president.(APPLAUSE)First, we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam. Containing the spread of radical Islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the United States and indeed the world. Events may require the use of military force, but it’s also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the Cold War.In this, we’re going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence, attacks and everything else. It is a dangerous world, more dangerous now than it has ever been.We should work — thank you.(APPLAUSE)We should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical Islam. But this has to be a two-way street. They must also be good to us. Remember that. They have to be good to us, no longer one way. It’s now two-way. And remember, us and all we’re doing, they have to appreciate what we’ve done to them. We’re going to help, but they have to appreciate what we’ve done for them. The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens and dozens more. We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies. We have no idea where these people are coming from. There’s no documentation. There’s no paperwork. There’s nothing. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant.A pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next San Bernardino or frankly, much worse. All you have to do is look at the World Trade Center and September 11th, one of the great catastrophes, in my opinion, the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country; worse than Pearl Harbor because you take a look at what’s happened, and citizens were attacked, as opposed to the military being attacked — one of the true great catastrophes.And then there’s ISIS. I have a simple message for them. Their days are numbered. I won’t tell them where and I won’t tell them how. We must…(APPLAUSE)… we must as a nation be more unpredictable. We are totally predictable. We tell everything. We’re sending troops. We tell them. We’re sending something else. We have a news conference. We have to be unpredictable. And we have to be unpredictable starting now.But they’re going to be gone. ISIS will be gone if I’m elected president. And they’ll be gone quickly. They will be gone very, very quickly.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Secondly, we have to rebuild our military and our economy. The Russians and Chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look at what’s happened to us. Our nuclear weapons arsenal, our ultimate deterrent, has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal. And it has to happen immediately. Our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today. The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time. The Air Force is about one-third smaller than 1991. Pilots flying B-52s in combat missions today. These planes are older than virtually everybody in this room.And what are we doing about this? President Obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that in real dollars, cuts nearly 25 percent from what we were spending in 2011. Our military is depleted and we’re asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming.We will spend what we need to rebuild our military. It is the cheapest, single investment we can make. We will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind. Our military dominance must be unquestioned, and I mean unquestioned, by anybody and everybody.But we will look for savings and spend our money wisely. In this time of mounting debt, right now we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem. But I do. No one dollar can be wasted. Not one single dollar can we waste. We’re also going to have to change our trade, immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again. And to put Americans first again.This will ensure that our own workers, right here in America, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues, increase our economic might as a nation, make us strong financially again. So, so important. We need to think smart about areas where our technological superiority, and nobody comes close, gives us an edge.This includes 3D printing, artificial intelligence and cyber warfare. A great country also takes care of its warriors. Our commitment to them is absolute, and I mean absolute. A trump administration will give our servicemen and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve and where they serve. And the best care in the world when they return as veterans and they come back home to civilian life. Our veterans…(APPLAUSE)Our veterans have not been treated fairly or justly. These are our great people and we must treat them fairly. We must even treat them really, really well and that will happen under the Trump administration.(APPLAUSE)Finally, we must develop a foreign policy based on American interests. Businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries. Look at what happened in the 1990s. Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania — and this was a horrible time for us — were attacked. and 17 brave sailors were killed on the USS Cole.And what did we do? It seemed we put more effort into adding China into the World Trade organization, which has been a total disaster for the United States. Frankly, we spent more time on that than we did in stopping Al Qaida. We even had an opportunity to take out Osama bin Laden and we didn’t do itAnd then we got hit at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Again, the worst attack on our country in its history. Our foreign policy goals must be based on America’s core national security interests. And the following will be my priorities.In the Middle East our goals must be, and I mean must be, to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change. We need to be clear sighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies. And believe me, we have groups that no matter what you do, they will be the enemy.TRUMP: We have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are, who those people are, and not help them. And we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends.(APPLAUSE)We desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China. We have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes, but we are not bound to be adversaries. We should seek common ground based on shared interests.Russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism. I believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible. Common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon. Good for both countries.Some say the Russians won’t be reasonable. I intend to find out. If we can’t make a deal under my administration, a deal that’s great — not good, great — for America, but also good for Russia, then we will quickly walk from the table. It’s as simple as that. We’re going to find out.Fixing our relations with China is another important step — and really toward creating an even more prosperous period of time. China respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically, which they are doing like never before, we have lost all of their respect.We have a massive trade deficit with China, a deficit that we have to find a way quickly, and I mean quickly, to balance. A strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China, better than we have right now. Look at what China is doing in the South China Sea. They’re not supposed to be doing it.No respect for this country or this president. We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways. If need be, that’s what’s going to have to happen.After I’m elected president, I will also call for a summit with our NATO allies and a separate summit with our Asian allies. In these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges. For instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade NATO’s outdated mission and structure, grown out of the Cold War to confront our shared challenges, including migration and Islamic terrorism.(APPLAUSE)I will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative. But if America fights, it must only fight to win.(APPLAUSE)I will never sent our finest into battle unless necessary, and I mean absolutely necessary, and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital V.(APPLAUSE)Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction. The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy. With President Obama and Secretary Clinton we’ve had the exact opposite — a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy, one that has blazed the path of destruction in its wake.After losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worst shape in the Middle East than ever, ever before. I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of Obama/Clinton. It has been a complete and total disaster.I will also be prepared to deploy America’s economic resources. Financial leverage and sanctions can be very, very persuasive, but we need to use them selectively and with total determination.TRUMP: Our power will be used if others do not play by the rules. In other words, if they do not treat us fairly. Our friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce that line in the sand. Believe me.(APPLAUSE)However, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct. You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy. A superpower understands that caution and restraint are really truly signs of strength. Although not in government service, I was totally against the war in Iraq, very proudly, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East. Sadly, I was correct, and the biggest beneficiary has been has been Iran, who is systematically taking over Iraq and gaining access to their very rich oil reserves, something it has wanted to do for decades.And now, to top it off, we have ISIS. My goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations. That’s why I also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect resumes but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war. We have to look to new people.(APPLAUSE)We have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly don’t know what they’re doing, even though they may look awfully good writing in the New York Times or being watched on television.Finally, I will work with our allies to reinvigorate Western values and institutions. Instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants, we should understand that strengthening and promoting Western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions.(APPLAUSE)These are my goals as president. I will seek a foreign policy that all Americans, whatever their party, can support, so important, and which our friends and allies will respect and totally welcome. The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies, that’s what we want. We want them to be our allies.We want the world to be — we want to bring peace to the world. Too much destruction out there, too many destructive weapons. The power of weaponry is the single biggest problem that we have today in the world.To achieve these goals, Americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership. Again, many Americans must wonder why we our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than in defending their own. Americans…(APPLAUSE)Americans must know that we’re putting the American people first again on trade.(APPLAUSE)So true. On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy. The jobs, incomes and security of the American worker will always be my first priority.(APPLAUSE)No country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first. Both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must start doing the same. We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism. The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony. I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down and will never enter…(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And under my administration, we will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs.(APPLAUSE)NAFTA, as an example, has been a total disaster for the United States and has emptied our states — literally emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs. And I’ve just gotten to see it. I’ve toured Pennsylvania. I’ve toured New York. I’ve toured so many of the states. They have been cleaned out. Their manufacturing is gone.Never again, only the reverse — and I have to say this strongly — never again; only the reverse will happen. We will keep our jobs and bring in new ones. There will be consequences for the companies that leave the United States only to exploit it later. They fire the people. They take advantage of the United States. There will be consequences for those companies. Never again.Under a Trump administration, no American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of a foreign country.(APPLAUSE)I will view as president the world through the clear lens of American interests. I will be America’s greatest defender and most loyal champion. We will not apologize for becoming successful again, but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are.The world is most peaceful and most prosperous when America is strongest. America will continue and continue forever to play the role of peacemaker. We will always help save lives and indeed humanity itself, but to play the role, we must make America strong again.(APPLAUSE)And always — always, always, we must make, and we have to look at it from every angle, and we have no choice, we must make America respected again. We must make America truly wealthy again. And we must — we have to and we will make America great again. And if we do that — and if we do that, perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever, ever known. Thank you very much, everybody. I appreciate it. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)	1

https://www.snopes.com/david-clarke-military-medals/	Does Sheriff David Clarke Wear ‘Fake’ Military Medals?	false	['david clarke', ' donald trump', ' outrage', ' salon', ' stolen valor']	http://americannewsx.com/	http://americannewsx.com/hot-off-the-press/another-unqualified-bigoted-fraud-joining-440s-cabinet-sheriff-david-clarke/	2017/05/23	May 21, 2017 Laura Keeling Gun Violence , News , Op/Ed , Politics , Racism 0Sheriff Clarke, self-declared Trump appointee, brings more plagiarism and less valorTrump advocate, controversial Milwaukee County Sheriff, David Clarke, announced on Wednesday that he has been appointed as an  Assistant Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.  Though, there has been no corroboration of his appointment, as of yet, from the White House. As we’ve observed from previous appointments, Trump requires neither qualifications, experience nor training in the specific field, only undying loyalty to him. In the area of undying loyalty, Clarke excels. In the arena of qualifications and experience, he leaves much to be desired.In fact, CNN reported today that the sheriff had plagiarized portions of his Master’s thesis on US security. In fact, there were 47 incidents in his thesis of direct quotes from sources being included in his text without quotation marks. Clarke had been awarded the degree from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. He is not the first of Trump’s cabinet picks to have had plagiarism troubles, either, but the fourth . In his short tenure, Betsy DeVos, Neil Gorsuch, Monica Crowley and even Trump’s wife have all been accused of plagiarism.The specific position for which Clarke is reportedly being considered is Assistant Secretary in the Office of Partnership and Engagement where his primary function will be “to serve as liaison with state, local and tribal law enforcement and governments.” This is a position for which Clarke is uniquely unqualified. He’s a staunch conservative who’s made no bones about his intense dislike of Liberals/Democrats saying :“The only time I’d only reach across the aisle to a Democrat is to grab them by the throat.”This is not the attitude of a person who will be open to listening and considering different or opposing ideas or positions. What type of relationship does Trump think Clarke will have with Democrats or even moderate Republicans with this hard-line stance? Or does Trump even know what the position requirements are? Knowing Trump, probably not. Trump apparently thinks he’s “diversifying his cabinet.” It’s the diversity of ideas that’s important, not diversity in skin color.Clarke, like his hero Trump, is also impulsive. He, too, shoots from the hip spewing fact-free rhetoric from questionable sources or making claims that have already been debunked. His attacks on Black Lives Matter have been copious, vitriolic and unrelenting, but rarely based on facts.Following the shooting of two police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, he claimed that America was at war and that BLM was the enemy. However, the police chiefs in both cities had, after conducting a thorough investigation, publicly stated that neither perpetrator had been associated with Black Lives Matter. What the shooters did have in common was that both were ex-military, Afghan war veterans . It’s much more like likely that both were suffering from untreated PTSD than anything else. But, that doesn’t fit Sheriff Clarke’s hate-filled rhetoric, so he ignored it. Or, perhaps he never even considered PTSD as an option since he, like Trump, has never served in the military. Which brings me to my final point.Stolen Valor:2/ Look at this fucking guy's uniform. You see all that shit pinned all over his dress uniform jacket? That's not supposed to be there. pic.twitter.com/0QZlBxQjI8— Charles Clymer (@cmclymer) May 17, 2017Clarke loves posing with his chest full of medals except they’re neither military nor law enforcement. They have more in common with Army/Navy Store designer decorations for the chicken hawk out to impress the gullible than any sort of service. Several veterans have called him on this blatant attempt at passing himself off as a military hero. Just as he’s not a military hero, he’s not a law enforcement hero either if deaths within the jails you oversee is a measure. Four inmates died in the Milwaukee county jails in 2016. One from being denied water for 7 days.Clarke is also the subject of several lawsuits, as covered by Snopes.com, many stemming from unnecessary deaths under his watch. He also favors attacking the press if they dare report the truth about him. You can see why Trump would want him in his cabinet, though the White House does seem to be casting doubt on the appointment that Clarke is claiming:DHS has not confirmed that Clarke has been offered a position with the department. On 17 May 2017, the department’s official Twitter account posted :[Senior] positions are announced when made official by the [Secretary]. No such announcement w/ regard to the Office of Public Engagement has been made.Clarke is an uncaring, unfeeling, unyielding, uncompromising, old fashioned misogynist who embarrasses himself with his inability to adapt to changing times, situations or updated facts. Put it all together, a perfect fit for the Trump administration.	1

(Michael Desmond / CBS)Even thoughhas evidently canceled ""Mike & Molly,"" network brass has decided the topic is off-limits.But that's not stopping unhappy cast members from sounding off.Rondi Reed, the veteran stage actress who plays the tough mother to Chicago cop Mike Biggs (Billy Gardell), reported in a Facebook  post last week that ""Mike & Molly"" will come to an end with season 6, which will air early next year. Shooting on the sitcom will finish in late January, she wrote, and only 13 episodes will be completed rather than the 22 originally ordered.""The network has its reasons, and I will not get into a debate, discussion, or campaign to get them to change their minds,"" Reed wrote, adding that executive producerChuck Lorreand studio Warner Bros. Television tried to find another home for the show but had no luck.""It is a fact and we have known for a few weeks,"" Reed wrote. Indeed, Gardell tweeted on Dec. 3 that fans would soon see ""our last episodes,"" although the tweet did not make the same splash that Reed's post did.Melissa McCarthy, the film star who plays Mike's wife, ex-teacher Molly Flynn,  tweeted Monday that she was ""shocked and heartbroken"" when CBS canceled the show.Ratings for ""Mike & Molly"" have tapered since season 1, although not alarmingly so. Season 5 averaged a still-respectable 9.9 million total viewers in live + same day viewing, according to Nielsen. However, production costs rise substantially the longer a show is on the air, partly because of prenegotiated cast salary increases. That's why even modestly falling ratings can spell the end for an aging show.Typically in a case like this, the network would announce the show's termination well in advance of the final episode, giving the cast members and creators plenty of time to ruminate in the media and take a victory lap before the series finale.But CBS has apparently decided that's not happening this time. Network spokespersons had no comment to the cast's posts and tweets. CBS would not even confirm that the show is ending.Why not? That will have to remain open to speculation, unless Reed or someone else wants to start discussing things.What do you think of ""Mike & Molly"" ending its run?Twitter:  @scottcollinsLATALSO:"	1
https://www.snopes.com/politics/sexuality/doping.asp	Is ‘Abortion Doping’ a Real Practice?	unproven	['moral outrage', ' olympics']	https://www.nytimes.com/	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/sports/olympics/russia-doping-olympics.html?_r=0	2017/12/11	Bring on the comeuppance. The remaining big question, with the I.O.C.’s beleaguered president Thomas Bach expected to make an announcement on Tuesday, is whether there should be any Russian athletes in Pyeongchang. Should some be allowed to compete as individuals without any of the nationalistic trappings after proving they are subject to strict drug-testing regimens? Richard Pound, the senior I.O.C. member, thinks not. “I think it has gone too far, and the government shows no contrition or recognition regarding the established facts,” Pound said in an email message on Saturday. With Russian leader Vladimir V. Putin having suggested that he would resist sending athletes to compete as neutrals, Pound thinks the message from the I.O.C. “The I.O.C. needs to take control of the situation, rather than allow the Russians to pre-empt it by walking away,” Pound said. A 75-year-old Canadian tax lawyer and former Olympic swimmer, Pound has been one of the key figures in the fight to make Russia accountable. He was chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency commission that first confirmed the scale of Russian cheating in track and field in November 2015 in the wake of a report by the German television network ARD. “It’s worse than we thought,” Pound said then before also making it clear that he hoped the Russians would take the hint, make the necessary institutional and cultural changes and not be banned from the upcoming Olympics. A blanket ban could generate legal appeals. For Pound to advocate such a penalty represents a significant hardening in his position. And though he is the only I.O.C. member to have taken this stance publicly, one suspects Bach and many of his lieutenants were feeling rather embittered themselves as they listened to Vitaly Mutko last week. Mutko, the former Russian sports minister now in charge of organizing the FIFA World Cup in Russia in 2018, engaged in a filibuster devoted to denial at a FIFA news conference in which he lashed out at the I.O.C. and others and continued to reject the notion of state involvement in Russian doping. If this was contrition, it certainly did not sound like it. Nor does it help that Mutko, one of the alleged overseers of the doping effort in Sochi, actually got a promotion after those Games and is now deputy prime minister. But more earnest attempts at kowtowing could be forthcoming, perhaps even a rapid marginalization of Mutko, which the I.O.C. would likely perceive as too little too late. For now, the lobbying is accelerating. Yevgenia Medvedeva, the Russian who has dominated women’s figure skating since the Sochi Games, is expected to give a speech to the I.O.C. executive board as part of the Russian delegation to Tuesday’s meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland. Medvedeva would be one of the main attractions in Pyeongchang if allowed to compete. Meanwhile, the leaders of three international winter sports federations — ice hockey, luge and curling — have made it clear that they do not support a blanket ban on Russian athletes in Pyeongchang.

The trouble is that in Russia’s situation, individual clemency would seem more a case of not sanctioning the few for the actions of the many. The numbers are stunning, and they continue to tick upward. The I.O.C. has now retroactively banned 25 Russians who competed in the Sochi Games for doping offenses, stripping 11 medals, and it is not over yet. As of Sunday, 99 Russians had been disqualified from all past Olympics: more than three times the total of any other nation. Collective punishment already applies in other instances in sports. Consider relay team members who are stripped of medals because of a teammate’s doping violation; or athletes who have been forced to comply with their nation’s Olympic boycotts. There have been plenty of lost generations for both just causes and more dubious causes. In Pound’s veteran view (he has been an I.O.C. member since 1978), the Russian situation has much in common with the I.O.C. banning South Africa — and all of its athletes — from the Olympics from 1964 through 1988 because of the nation’s segregationist apartheid policies. “At a certain point, everyone in Russia is part of the corrupted system and must suffer the consequences of such involvement,” Pound said. “The I.O.C. The I.O.C. already has missed one opportunity to send an unmistakably strong message to Russia and the athletes it has defrauded: declining to ban the Russian team from last year’s Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Instead the I.O.C., citing the need to complete its own investigations, left it up to individual federations to make the call. Track and field’s governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, was the only one that banned the Russian team, although it did allow one Russian athlete, long jumper Darya Klishina, to take part as an independent athlete because she had been based outside of Russia and was subject to extensive international antidoping controls. With Russia still banned from track and field this year, Klishina was part of a delegation of 19 authorized neutral athletes who competed in the world championships in London in August. That presumably would be the template if the I.O.C. does the expected and allows independent Russian athletes but no Russian team in Pyeongchang. It would be, as it was in London, an odd arrangement: muted celebrations, laps of honor without flags, the Olympic anthem on the podium. But in Russia and elsewhere, the medals won by neutrals would still be perceived as Russian medals. That is if Putin allowed neutrals to compete: something he has said would be “humiliation for the country” and something he is presumably not eager to accept with Russian presidential elections coming in March. “You probably cannot divorce this issue from the dynamics and politics of the presidential election,” said Michael Payne, the global sports consultant and former I.O.C. marketing director. But Bach and the I.O.C. can no longer be concerned with Russian politics or Putin’s credibility at this very late stage in the Games. The future of their own organization and their own credibility is too much at stake. Based on what they and we now know, the I.O.C. must, at the very least, ban Russia from Pyeongchang. Don’t be shocked if it follows Pound’s advice and bans the Russians, too. A version of this article appears in print on December 5, 2017, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: Russian Doping: The Case for Barring a Nation Entirely.	1
https://www.snopes.com/noonan-on-trump/	Peggy Noonan on Donald Trump	attribution-false	['donald trump', ' peggy noonan']	https://www.reddit.com/	https://www.reddit.com/r/forwardsfromgrandma/comments/3g2lt8/fwd_fw_trump_things_you_might_not_know/	2016/01/12	Something to think about! As candidates for president emerge it is important to know where each stands on issues that are important to AMERICA. The USA cannot afford to make another mistake in electing an anti-American Socialist, someone with a poor track record of public service, or someone who values illegal invaders more than hard-working, loyal Americans and her military. Trump, hopefully, is waking some of the RINOs up.  The criticisms of Trump are amazingly​ missing something. They are​ lacking in ​negative stories from those who work for him or have had business dealings with him. After all the employees he’s had and all the business deals he’s made there is a void of criticism. In fact, long term employees call him a strong and merciful leader and say he is far more righteous and of high integrity​ than people may think​. And while it may surprise many, he’s actually humble when it comes to his generosity and kindness. A good example is a story that tells of his limo breaking down on a deserted highway outside of New York City. A middle-aged couple stopped to help him and as a thank you he paid off their mortgage, but he didn’t brag about that. Generous and good people rarely talk of charity they bestow on others.​But as much as all this is interesting, the real thing that people want to know is what Donald Trump’s plan is for America. It’s funny how so many people say they don’t know what it is, or they act like Trump is hiding it. The information is readily available if people would just do a little homework. But, since most Americans won't do their own research, here, in no particular order, is an overview of many of Trump's positions and plans: 1.) Trump believes that America should not intervene militarily in other country’s problems without being compensated for doing so. If America is going to risk the lives of our soldiers and incur the expense of going to war, then the nations we help must be willing to pay for our help. Using the Iraq War as an example, he cites the huge monetary expense to American taxpayers (over $1.5 trillion, and possibly much more depending on what sources are used to determine the cost) in addition to the cost in human life. He suggests that Iraq should have been required to give us enough of their oil to pay for the expenses we incurred. He includes in those expenses the medical costs for our military and $5 million for each family that lost a loved one in the war and $2 million for each family of soldiers who received severe injuries. 2.) Speaking of the military, Trump wants America to have a strong military again. He believes the single most important function of the federal government is national defense. He has said he wants to find the General Patton or General MacArthur that could lead our military buildup back to the strength it needs to be. While he hasn’t said it directly that I know of, Trump’s attitude about America and about winning tells me he’d most likely be quick to eliminate rules of engagement that handicap our military in battle. Clearly Trump is a “win at all costs” kind of guy, and I’m sure that would apply to our national defense and security, too. 3.) Trump wants a strong foreign policy and believes that it must include 7 core principles (which seem to support my comment in the last point): ·     American interests come first.  Always. No apologies.·     Maximum firepower and military preparedness.·     Only go to war to win.·     Stay loyal to your friends and suspicious of your enemies.·     Keep the technological sword razor sharp.·     See the unseen. Prepare for threats before they materialize.·     Respect and support our present and past warriors. 4.) Trump believes that terrorists who are captured should be treated as military combatants, not as criminals like the Obama administration treats them. 5.) Trump makes the point that China’s manipulation of their currency has given them unfair advantage in our trade dealings with them. He says we must tax their imports to offset their currency manipulation, which will cause American companies to be competitive again and drive manufacturing back to America and create jobs here.  Although he sees China as the biggest offender, he believes that America should protect itself from all foreign efforts to take our jobs and manufacturing. For example, Ford is building a plant in Mexico and Trump suggests that every part or vehicle Ford makes in Mexico be taxed 35% if they want to bring it into the U. S., which would cause companies like Ford to no longer be competitive using their Mexican operations and move manufacturing back to the U. S., once again creating jobs here. 6.) Trump wants passage of NOPEC legislation (No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act – NOPEC – S.394), which would allow the government to sue OPEC for violating antitrust laws. According to Trump, that would break up the cartel. He also wants to unleash our energy companies to drill domestically (sound like Sarah Palin’s drill baby, drill?) thereby increasing domestic production creating jobs and driving domestic costs of oil and gas down while reducing dependence on foreign oil. 7.) Trump believes a secure border is critical for both security and prosperity in America. He wants to build a wall to stop illegals from entering and put controls on immigration. (And he says he’ll get Mexico to pay for the wall, which many have scoffed at, but given his business successes I wouldn’t put it past him.) He also wants to enforce our immigration laws and provide no path to citizenship for illegals. 8.) Trump wants a radical change to the tax system to not only make it better for average Americans, but also to encourage businesses to stay here and foreign businesses to move here. The resulting influx of money to our nation would do wonders for our economy. He wants to make America the place to do business. He also wants to lower the death tax and the taxes on capital gains and dividends. This would put more than $1.6 trillion back into the economy and help rebuild the 1.5 million jobs we’ve lost to the current tax system. He also wants to charge companies who outsource jobs overseas a 20% tax, but for those willing to move jobs back to America they would not be taxed. And for citizens he has a tax plan that would allow Americans to keep more of what they earn and spark economic growth. He wants to change the personal income tax to:·     Up to $30,000 taxed at 1%·     From $30,000 to $100,000 taxed at 5%·     From $100,000 to $1,000,000 taxed at 10%·    $1,000,000 and above taxed at 15% 9.) Trump wants Obamacare repealed. He says it’s a “job-killing, health care-destroying monstrosity” that “can’t be reformed, salvaged, or fixed.” He believes in allowing real competition in the health insurance marketplace to allow competition to drive prices down. He also believes in tort reform to get rid of defensive medicine and lower costs. 10.) Trump wants spending reforms in Washington, acknowledging that America spends far more than it receives in revenue.  He has said he believes that if we don’t stop increasing the national debt once it hits $24 trillion it will be impossible to save this country. 11.) Even though he says we need to cut spending, he does not want to harm those on Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security. He believes that the citizens have faithfully paid in to the system to have these services available and that the American government has an obligation to fulfill its end of the bargain and provide those benefits. Therefore, he wants to build the economy up so that we have the revenue to pay those costs without cutting the benefits to the recipients. He disagrees with Democrats who think raising taxes is the answer and says that when you do that you stifle the economy. On the other hand, when you lower taxes and create an environment to help businesses they will grow, hire more workers, and those new workers will be paying taxes that become more tax revenue for the government. 12.) Trump also wants reform of the welfare state saying that America needs “a safety net, not a hammock.” He believes in a welfare to work program that would help reduce the welfare roles and encourage people to get back to work. And he wants a crackdown on entitlement fraud. 13.) Trump believes climate change is a hoax. 14.) Trump opposes Common Core. 15.) Trump is pro-life, although he allows for an exception due to rape, incest, or the life of the mother. 16.) Trump is pro 2nd Amendment rights. 17.) Trump’s view on same-sex marriage is that marriage is between a man and a woman, but he also believes that this is a states rights issue, not a federal issue. 18.) Trump supports the death penalty. Trump believes that there is a lack of common sense, innovative thinking in Washington (Hmmm… looks like he believes in horse sense!). He says it’s about seeing the unseen and that’s the kind of thinking we need to turn this country around. He tells a personal story to illustrate the point: “When I opened Trump National Golf Club at Rancho Palos Verdes in Los Angeles, I was immediately told that I would need to build a new and costly ballroom. The current ballroom was gorgeous, but it only sat 200 people and we were losing business because people needed a larger space for their events. Building a new ballroom would take years to get approval and permits (since it’s on the Pacific Ocean), and cost about $5 million. I took one look at the ballroom and saw immediately what needed to be done. The problem wasn’t the size of the room, it was the size of the chairs. They were huge, heavy, and unwieldy. We didn’t need a bigger ballroom, we needed smaller chairs! So I had them replaced with high-end, smaller chairs. I then had our people sell the old chairs and got more money for them than the cost of the new chairs. In the end, the ballroom went from seating 200 people to seating 320 people. Our visitors got the space they desired, and I spared everyone the hassle of years of construction and $5 million of expense.  It’s amazing what you can accomplish with a little common sense.    On top of his saving years of construction and $5 million in expenses, he also was able to keep the ballroom open for business during the time it would have been under remodeling, which allowed him to continue to make money on the space instead of losing that revenue during construction time. Donald Trump’s entire life has been made up of success and winning. He’s been accused of bankruptcies, but that’s not true.  He’s never filed personal bankruptcy. He’s bought companies and legally used bankruptcy laws to restructure their debt, just as businesses do all the time. But he’s never been bankrupt personally. He’s a fighter that clearly loves America and would fight for our nation.  Earlier I quoted Trump saying, “I love America. And when you love something, you protect it passionately – fiercely, even.”   We never hear that from Democrats or even from most Republicans.  Donald Trump is saying things that desperately need to be said but no other candidate has shown the fortitude to stand up and say them.  Looking over this list of what he wants for America I see a very necessary set of goals that are long past due. Before we criticize someone because the media does, maybe we should seriously consider what he has to offer.	0

Thanks to the generous support of local sponsors, this year's festival promises to be a community celebration that continues to provide needed resources to local charitable organizations. More... About the Song ""Jingle Bells,"" the now world famous holiday tune, was composed at the Simpson Tavern in Medford, Massachusetts in 1850 by James Pierpont (1822-1893). The tavern stood at the site which is now 19 High Street in Medford Square. The song was composed in the presence of Mrs. Otis Waterman, who later verified the location of the song's composition. In 1857, James Pierpont, while living in Georgia, copyrighted ""Jingle Bells."" The lyrics of the song tell of the sleigh rides held on Salem Street in the early 1800s.

Doctors on the case at Southern Utah Medical Center say that Cameron is “in the advanced stages” and that if they can find a cure, they’ll have less than a day to administer it:“The problem is, there’s no research on the disease because not enough people have it. I mean, sure there would be enough data to do an analysis and it’s a fairly simple organism causing it, but still…why develop something that will do nothing but cost the shareholders money. To save a dozen people?”Cameron’s family has asked for privacy. His sister, the famous actress sister, the beautiful Candace Cameron, said he probably contracted the disease while on mission in Western Africa:“Kirk was there and he heard of someone with the disease and he wanted to meet him. Ironically he was convinced that anyone who was afflicted with such a rare and deadly pathogen had to be chosen by God to be struck down.We haven’t ruled out that Kirk has a secret sin and is paying for it with his life. His maker may want to see him sooner than later. Ultimately we’re hoping that he is cured by a miracle.”Cameron isn’t expected to make it through the night.

https://www.snopes.com/politics/conspiracy/guillotines.asp	Did the U.S. Government Purchase 30,000 Guillotines?	false	['guillotines']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/HWmri	2013/06/22	Video courtesy of:  FBCFilmsHB 1274 authorizes the state of Georgia to execute citizens by guillotine:Georgia House of Representatives – 1995/1996 Sessions HB 1274 – Death penalty; guillotine provisions Code Sections – 17-10-38/ 17-10-44 A BILL TO BE ENTITLED AN ACT1- 1 To amend Article 2 of Chapter 10 of Title 17 of the Official1- 2 Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to the death penalty1- 3 generally, so as to provide a statement of legislative1- 4 policy; to provide for death by guillotine; to provide for1- 5 applicability; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other1- 6 purposes.1- 8 The General Assembly finds that while prisoners condemned to1- 9 death may wish to donate one or more of their organs for1-10 transplant, any such desire is thwarted by the fact that1-11 electrocution makes all such organs unsuitable for1-12 transplant. The intent of the General Assembly in enacting1-13 this legislation is to provide for a method of execution1-14 which is compatible with the donation of organs by a1-15 condemned prisoner.source:  http://www.cephas-library.com/nwo/nwo_guillotine_provisions_in_georgia.htmlOne question to consider:If Georgia was planning to utilize guillotines as a method of execution, how could this be carried out without purchasing guillotines?NOTE: Special Agent Ted Gunderson wrote the original of this article prior to his death in 2011.http://www.myfoxmemphis.com/story/18527976/former-memphis-fbi-chief-diesby, Ted Gunderson (Retired FBI Agent)Think about this; Why does the US government need 30,000 Guillotines and over 600 Million rounds of hollow point bullets?There are over 800 prison camps in the United States. All fully operational and ready to receive prisoners. They are all staffed and even surrounded by full-time guards. But they are all empty. These camps are to be operated by FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) should Martial Law need to be implemented in the United States and all it would take is a presidential signature on a proclamation and the attorney general’s signature on a warrant to which a list of names is attached. Ask yourself if you really want to be on THE list.The Rex 84 Program was established on the reasoning that if a “mass exodus” of illegal aliens crossed the Mexican/US border, they would be quickly rounded up and detained in detention centers by FEMA. Rex 84 allowed many military bases to be closed down and to be turned into prisons. Operation Cable Splicer and Garden Plot are the two sub programs which will be implemented once the Rex 84 program is initiated for its proper purpose. Garden Plot is the program to control the population. Cable Splicer is the program for an orderly takeover of the state and local governments by the federal government. FEMA is the executive arm of the coming police state and thus will head up all operations. The Presidential Executive Orders already listed on the Federal Register also are part of the legal framework for this operation.The camps all have railroad facilities as well as roads leading to and from the detention facilities. Many also have an airport nearby. The majority of the camps can house a population of 20,000 prisoners. Currently, the largest of these facilities is just outside of Fairbanks, Alaska. The Alaskan facility is a massive mental health facility and can hold approximately 2 million people. Now let’s review the justification for any actions taken. Executive Orders associated with FEMA that would suspend the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. These Executive Orders have been on record for nearly 30 years and could be enacted by the stroke of a Presidential pen:EXECUTIVE ORDER 10990 allows the government to take over all modes of transportation and control of highways and seaports.EXECUTIVE ORDER 10995 allows the government to seize and control the communication media.EXECUTIVE ORDER 10997 allows the government to take over all electrical power, gas, petroleum, fuels and minerals.EXECUTIVE ORDER 10998 allows the government to seize all means of transportation, including personal cars, trucks or vehicles of any kind and total control over all highways, seaports, and waterways.EXECUTIVE ORDER 10999 allows the government to take over all food resources and farms.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11000 allows the government to mobilize civilians into work brigades under government supervision.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11001 allows the government to take over all health, education and welfare functions.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11002 designates the Postmaster General to operate a national registration of all persons.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11003 allows the government to take over all airports and aircraft, including commercial aircraft.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11004 allows the Housing and Finance Authority to relocate communities, build new housing with public funds, designate areas to be abandoned, and establish new locations for populations.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11005 allows the government to take over railroads, inland waterways and public storage facilities.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11051 specifies the responsibility of the Office of Emergency Planning and gives authorization to put all Executive Orders into effect in times of increased international tensions and economic or financial crisis.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11310 grants authority to the Department of Justice to enforce the plans set out in Executive Orders, to institute industrial support, to establish judicial and legislative liaison, to control all aliens, to operate penal and correctional institutions, and to advise and assist the President.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11049 assigns emergency preparedness function to federal departments and agencies, consolidating 21 operative Executive Orders issued over a fifteen year period.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11921 allows the Federal Emergency Preparedness Agency to develop plans to establish control over the mechanisms of production and distribution, of energy sources, wages, salaries, credit and the flow of money in U.S. financial institution in any undefined national emergency. It also provides that when a state of emergency is declared by the President, Congress cannot review the action for six months. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has broad powers in every aspect of the nation. General Frank Salzedo, chief of FEMA’s Civil Security Division stated in a 1983 conference that he saw FEMA’s role as a “new frontier in the protection of individual and governmental leaders from assassination, and of civil and military installations from sabotage and/or attack, as well as prevention of dissident groups from gaining access to U.S. opinion, or a global audience in times of crisis.” FEMA’s powers were consolidated by President Carter to incorporate the National Security Act of 1947 allows for the strategic relocation of industries, services, government and other essential economic activities, and to rationalize the requirements for manpower, resources and production facilities. 1950 Defense Production Act gives the President sweeping powers over all aspects of the economy. Act of August 29, 1916 authorizes the Secretary of the Army, in time of war, to take possession of any transportation system for transporting troops, material, or any other purpose related to the emergency. International Emergency Economic Powers Act enables the President to seize the property of a foreign country or national. These powers were transferred to FEMA in a sweeping consolidation in 1979.If playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.Your browser doesn't support full screen.

He mocks conservatives, so therefore he’s a fantastic astrophysicist! He thinks people who believe in God are idiots, so therefore he’s a fantastic astrophysicist! He’s on PBS, so therefore he’s a fantastic astrophysicist! I wouldn’t exactly say this emperor has no clothes, but I would say this emperor might have only a speedo and a wristband. Maybe some sunglasses. Snarky science is not better science.I could be wrong. Seriously. He might be the bee’s knees of cosmology. I’m just suggesting that Tyson — and other similar science celebs like Bill Nye and Richard Dawkins — may be a bit overestimated because the zeitgeist likes their conclusions. They are scientists on the leading edge of culture, but are they actually on the leading edge of science, too? It would be interesting to discover from the true and quiet humble giants of scientific thought — those not seeking television shows, book deals, and societal approbation — where these celebrity-scientist hybrids rank.I’ve listened to Neil deGrasse Tyson before. And what I observe is a smart guy who consistently enjoys asserting his intellectual supremacy over others more than he actually likes educating. In one of his worse moments, Tyson mocked a 12-year-old girl who suggested she’d like to live on Jupiter. He ridiculed her in the midst of a crowd, then later, several times, on Twitter. That told me everything I needed to know about Neil deGrasse Tyson.For that moment he was just a horse’s astrophysicist.Associated Press award-winning columnist Neal Larson of Idaho Falls is also the author of “Living in Spin.” He is a conservative talk show host on KID Newsradio 590 AM, 106.3 and 92.1 FM, and also at www.kidnewsradio.com . “The Neal Larson Show” can be heard weekday mornings from 8 to 10.

When Edison was seven his family moved to Port Huron, Michigan. Edison lived here until he struck out on his own at the age of sixteen. Edison had very little formal education as a child, attending school only for a few months. He was taught reading, writing, and arithmetic by his mother, but was always a very curious child and taught himself much by reading on his own. This belief in self-improvement remained throughout his life.Edison began working at an early age, as most boys did at the time. At thirteen he took a job as a newsboy, selling newspapers and candy on the local railroad that ran through Port Huron to Detroit. He seems to have spent much of his free time reading scientific, and technical books, and also had the opportunity at this time to learn how to operate a telegraph. By the time he was sixteen, Edison was proficient enough to work as a telegrapher full time.The development of the telegraph was the first step in the communication revolution, and the telegraph industry expanded rapidly in the second half of the 19th century. This rapid growth gave Edison and others like him a chance to travel, see the country, and gain experience. Edison worked in a number of cities throughout the United States before arriving in Boston in 1868. Here Edison began to change his profession from telegrapher to inventor. He received his first patent on an electric vote recorder, a device intended for use by elected bodies such as Congress to speed the voting process. This invention was a commercial failure. Edison resolved that in the future he would only invent things that he was certain the public would want.Edison moved to New York City in 1869. He continued to work on inventions related to the telegraph, and developed his first successful invention, an improved stock ticker called the ""Universal Stock Printer"". For this and some related inventions Edison was paid $40,000. This gave Edison the money he needed to set up his first small laboratory and manufacturing facility in Newark, New Jersey in 1871. During the next five years, Edison worked in Newark inventing and manufacturing devices that greatly improved the speed and efficiency of the telegraph. He also found to time to get married to Mary Stilwell and start a family.In 1876 Edison sold all his Newark manufacturing concerns and moved his family and staff of assistants to the small village of Menlo Park, twenty-five miles southwest of New York City. Edison established a new facility containing all the equipment necessary to work on any invention. This research and development laboratory was the first of its kind anywhere; the model for later, modern facilities such as Bell Laboratories, this is sometimes considered to be Edison's greatest invention. Here Edison began to change the world. Edison's first phonograph - 1877.NPS PhotoThe first great invention developed by Edison in Menlo Park was the tin foil phonograph. The first machine that could record and reproduce sound created a sensation and brought Edison international fame. Edison toured the country with the tin foil phonograph, and was invited to the White House to demonstrate it to President Rutherford B. Hayes in April 1878.Edison next undertook his greatest challenge, the development of a practical incandescent, electric light. The idea of electric lighting was not new, and a number of people had worked on, and even developed forms of electric lighting. But up to that time, nothing had been developed that was remotely practical for home use. Edison's eventual achievement was inventing not just an incandescent electric light, but also an electric lighting system that contained all the elements necessary to make the incandescent light practical, safe, and economical. After one and a half years of work, success was achieved when an incandescent lamp with a filament of carbonized sewing thread burned for thirteen and a half hours. The first public demonstration of the Edison's incandescent lighting system was in December 1879, when the Menlo Park laboratory complex was electrically lighted. Edison spent the next several years creating the electric industry. In September 1882, the first commercial power station, located on Pearl Street in lower Manhattan, went into operation providing light and power to customers in a one square mile area; the electric age had begun. An early sketch from a laboratory notebook of an electric lightbulb.NPS PhotoThe success of his electric light brought Edison to new heights of fame and wealth, as electricity spread around the world. Edison's various electric companies continued to grow until in 1889 they were brought together to form Edison General Electric. Despite the use of Edison in the company title however, Edison never controlled this company. The tremendous amount of capital needed to develop the incandescent lighting industry had necessitated the involvement of investment bankers such as J.P. Morgan. When Edison General Electric merged with its leading competitor Thompson-Houston in 1892, Edison was dropped from the name, and the company became simply General Electric.This period of success was marred by the death of Edison's wife Mary in 1884. Edison's involvement in the business end of the electric industry had caused Edison to spend less time in Menlo Park. After Mary's death, Edison was there even less, living instead in New York City with his three children. A year later, while vacationing at a friends house in New England, Edison met Mina Miller and fell in love. The couple was married in February 1886 and moved to West Orange, New Jersey where Edison had purchased an estate, Glenmont, for his bride. Thomas Edison lived here with Mina until his death.When Edison moved to West Orange, he was doing experimental work in makeshift facilities in his electric lamp factory in nearby Harrison, New Jersey. A few months after his marriage, however, Edison decided to build a new laboratory in West Orange itself, less than a mile from his home. Edison possessed both the resources and experience by this time to build, ""the best equipped and largest laboratory extant and the facilities superior to any other for rapid and cheap development of an invention "". The new laboratory complex consisting of five buildings opened in November 1887. A three story main laboratory building contained a power plant, machine shops, stock rooms, experimental rooms and a large library. Four smaller one story buildings built perpendicular to the main building contained a physics lab, chemistry lab, metallurgy lab, pattern shop, and chemical storage. The large size of the laboratory not only allowed Edison to work on any sort of project, but also allowed him to work on as many as ten or twenty projects at once. Facilities were added to the laboratory or modified to meet Edison's changing needs as he continued to work in this complex until his death in 1931. Over the years, factories to manufacture Edison inventions were built around the laboratory. The entire laboratory and factory complex eventually covered more than twenty acres and employed 10,000 people at its peak during World War One (1914-1918).After opening the new laboratory, Edison began to work on the phonograph again, having set the project aside to develop the electric light in the late 1870s. By the 1890s, Edison began to manufacture phonographs for both home, and business use. Like the electric light, Edison developed everything needed to have a phonograph work, including records to play, equipment to record the records, and equipment to manufacture the records and the machines. In the process of making the phonograph practical, Edison created the recording industry. The development and improvement of the phonograph was an ongoing project, continuing almost until Edison's death.While working on the phonograph, Edison began working on a device that, ""does for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear"", this was to become motion pictures. Edison first demonstrated motion pictures in 1891, and began commercial production of ""movies"" two years later in a peculiar looking structure, built on the laboratory grounds, known as the Black Maria. Like the electric light and phonograph before it, Edison developed a complete system, developing everything needed to both film and show motion pictures. Edison's initial work in motion pictures was pioneering and original. However, many people became interested in this third new industry Edison created, and worked to further improve on Edison's early motion picture work. There were therefore many contributors to the swift development of motion pictures beyond the early work of Edison. By the late 1890s, a thriving new industry was firmly established, and by 1918 the industry had become so competitive that Edison got out of the movie business all together.The success of the phonograph and motion pictures in the 1890s helped offset the greatest failure of Edison's career. Throughout the decade Edison worked in his laboratory and in the old iron mines of northwestern New Jersey to develop methods of mining iron ore to feed the insatiable demand of the Pennsylvania steel mills. To finance this work, Edison sold all his stock in General Electric. Despite ten years of work and millions of dollars spent on research and development, Edison was never able to make the process commercially practical, and lost all the money he had invested. This would have meant financial ruin had not Edison continued to develop the phonograph and motion pictures at the same time. As it was, Edison entered the new century still financially secure and ready to take on another challenge.Edison's new challenge was to develop a better storage battery for use in electric vehicles. Edison very much enjoyed automobiles and owned a number of different types during his life, powered by gasoline, electricity, and steam. Edison thought that electric propulsion was clearly the best method of powering cars, but realized that conventional lead-acid storage batteries were inadequate for the job. Edison began to develop an alkaline battery in 1899. It proved to be Edison's most difficult project, taking ten years to develop a practical alkaline battery. By the time Edison introduced his new alkaline battery, the gasoline powered car had so improved that electric vehicles were becoming increasingly less common, being used mainly as delivery vehicles in cities. However, the Edison alkaline battery proved useful for lighting railway cars and signals, maritime buoys, and miners lamps. Unlike iron ore mining, the heavy investment Edison made over ten years was repaid handsomely, and the storage battery eventually became Edison's most profitable product. Further, Edison's work paved the way for the modern alkaline battery.By 1911, Thomas Edison had built a vast industrial operation in West Orange. Numerous factories had been built through the years around the original laboratory, and the staff of the entire complex had grown into the thousands. To better manage operations, Edison brought all the companies he had started to make his inventions together into one corporation, Thomas A. Edison Incorporated, with Edison as president and chairman. Edison was sixty-four by this time and his role with his company and in life began to change. Edison left more of the daily operations of both the laboratory and the factories to others. The laboratory itself did less original experimental work and instead worked more on refining existing Edison products such as the phonograph. Although Edison continued to file for and receive patents for new inventions, the days of developing new products that changed lives and created industries were behind him.In the 1915, Edison was asked to head the Naval Consulting Board. With the United States inching closer towards the involvement in World War One, the Naval Consulting Board was an attempt to organize the talents of the leading scientists and inventors in the United States for the benefit of the American armed forces. Edison favored preparedness, and accepted the appointment. The Board did not make a notable contribution to the final allied victory, but did serve as a precedent for future successful cooperation between scientists, inventors and the United States military. During the war, at age seventy, Edison spent several months on Long Island Sound in a borrowed navy vessel experimenting on techniques for detecting submarines.Edison's role in life began to change from inventor and industrialist to cultural icon, a symbol of American ingenuity, and a real life Horatio Alger story. In 1928, in recognition of a lifetime of achievement, the United States Congress voted Edison a special Medal of Honor. In 1929 the nation celebrated the golden jubilee of the incandescent light. The celebration culminated at a banquet honoring Edison given by Henry Ford at Greenfield Village, Ford's new American history museum, which included a complete restoration of the Menlo Park Laboratory. Attendees included President Herbert Hoover and many of the leading American scientists and inventors.The last experimental work of Edison's life was done at the request of Edison's good friends Henry Ford, and Harvey Firestone in the late 1920s. They asked Edison to find an alternative source of rubber for use in automobile tires. The natural rubber used for tires up to that time came from the rubber tree, which does not grow in the United States. Crude rubber had to be imported and was becoming increasingly expensive. With his customary energy and thoroughness, Edison tested thousands of different plants to find a suitable substitute, eventually finding a type of Goldenrod weed that could produce enough rubber to be feasible. Edison was still working on this at the time of his death.During the last two years of his life Edison was in increasingly poor health. Edison spent more time away from the laboratory, working instead at Glenmont. Trips to the family vacation home in Fort Myers, Florida became longer. Edison was past eighty and suffering from a number of ailments. In August 1931 Edison collapsed at Glenmont. Essentially house bound from that point, Edison steadily declined until at 3:21 am on October 18, 1931 the great man died.Last updated: February 26, 2015"	1

Stay over 180 days would therefore require a visa.Trump says this measure is to strengthen trade between the United States and Pakistan.However, Pakistanis who hold dual nationality will be banned from entering the United States if their other passport is from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen — the seven Muslim-majority countries “of concern”.It has emerged that trade and bilateral visa deals have been discussed by Trump and Pakistani Diplomats in the States.A source at the White House has hinted that Trump may revoke Australia’s opportunity of traveling to the United States without visas after cancelling all trade deals with the country.Allowing Pakistanis to the United States freely is not the only order signed into force by Trump since assuming office. He has signed five new executive orders – including one to expedite environmental review and approval of high-priority infrastructure projects.President Donald Trump signed executive orders to advance the construction of the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines.He also signed an executive order on Monday barring federal funds from organizations that promote abortion around the world, including the International Planned Parenthood Federation, in what activists say is the president’s first major pro-life action while in office.No more funds for Abortion-promotion organizationsThe policy, known as the Mexico City Policy or the Global Gag Rule, was first ushered in under Ronald Reagan and bars federal funds from going to foreign organizations that perform abortions overseas or lobby for the practice’s legalization in other countries.He has formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal on Monday, distancing America from its Asian allies as China’s influence in the region rises.Fulfilling a campaign pledge to end American involvement in the 2015 pact, Trump signed an executive order in the Oval Office pulling the United States from the 12-nation TPP.Donald Trump signs a visa-free travel policy for Pakistan added by onFebruary 11, 2016	1
https://www.snopes.com/sarah-palin-blames-mexican-muslims/	Sarah Palin Blames ‘Mexican Muslim’ Immigration for Fort Lauderdale Shooting?	false	['muslims', ' sarah palin']	http://politicono.com/	http://politicono.com/palin-blames-florida-shooting-obamas-policy-allowing-mexican-muslims-walk-freely-streets/	2017/01/12	Palin Blames Florida Shooting On “Obama’s Policy Of Allowing Mexican Muslims To Walk Freely On Our Streets”Written by Alex Stevan January 6th 2017(Photo Credit: Fox News)Five people have been shot dead by a gunman at Fort Lauderdale airport in Florida, say officials. It happened at the baggage claim area in Terminal 2, just before 1300 local time (1800 GMT), the airport confirmed. Five people were killed, eight injured and one person was unharmed in custody, said police and local officials. Hundreds of people were standing on the tarmac outside the terminal as dozens of police cars and ambulances rushed to the scene. A witness told MSNBC that the gunman was a “slender man” who was wearing a Star Wars T-shirt. Florida Senator Bill Nelson told media that the gunman has been identified as Esteban Santiago, but that has not been confirmed by law enforcement.Former half-term governor of Alaska Sarah Palin took to the press to offer her thoughts and prayers to the families of the victims, but also used the opportunity to once again criticize former President Barack Obama’s policy on illegal immigration. “First of all, I’d like to offer my condolences to the families of the victims of the Fort Lauderdale terrorist attack, as well as my support to those who have been injured in the incident,” she said. “Make no mistake – this was a full-on terrorist attack, the likes of which we’ve had several in the past months and years. These lone-wolf terrorist attacks have today become a danger far greater than any terrorist cell that might be planning an attack on U.S. soil. It is terrible that we are faced with such an unpredictable network of individuals who will stop at nothing in order to harm innocent civilians.”She added, “However, don’t be fooled by the idea that there was no stopping this sort of escalation of terrorist violence. We could have prevented all of this 8 years ago, but unfortunately, the citizens of this country – more specifically, true, conservative Americans were outvoted by those who believed Barack Obama was the right choice for president. Eight years later, I’m sad to say America is choking on terrorism, racial issues and gender catastrophes the likes of which are unknown in its recent history. Not only were the liberals not right; they have single-handedly surrendered this country into the hands of a man who’s done more damage to it than any Bush, Reagan or Stalin, for that matter, ever could.”“It is Barack Obama’s policy of allowing Mexican Muslims to walk freely on our streets that has caused so much death and destruction recently, including this latest incident which has taken 5 innocent lives,” she continued. “Think about that for a second. Why were Mexican Muslims even allowed to walk our streets in the first place, I ask you? They’re, like, double the threat – they’re half Muslim, which means that they hate all of America by default, and the other half is Mexican, which means they can be very hard-working, but at the same time, they’re also very jealous of white people. And if, by some miracle, you were to add just an ounce of Germanic heritage to that, you’d have Hitler in the mix as well. That means they’d be the ultimate killing machine. They should have been incarcerated from the beginning. Instead, we’re left with this situation.”“I guarantee you no potential gunman would have ever seen the light of day other than through prison bars if anyone other than Barack Obama had been president. All Muslim Mexicans would be scrutinized several times, compared to normal Muslims and Mexicans, the majority of whom would only be subjected to one scrutinization process yearly. Instead, they were left to their own twisted behavior under the excuse of civil liberties, and what happened? We had the Orlando gay club massacre, and now Fort Lauderdale. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out there’s a pretty obvious pattern here. And you better believe there’s more of them coming. So, when the next one happens, I’m not even going to look into who or what the shooter was. I’m directly going after Obama for carelessness on the job and dereliction of duty. Because, he was many things as president, but a patriot was not one of them,” Palin concluded.Most Popular >>	1

The American military has, characteristically, co-opted this information--and the related technology--for its own ends, developing two secret, and originally unrelated, programs.  One, Project Scoop, was set up to carefully harvest new and deadly pathogens from space for future use in the Cold War. The other, Project Wildfire, was charged with figuring out how to deal with alien organisms should they happen to make it to Earth.  The two projects collide when a mysterious space capsule recovered by the puzzled inhabitants of tiny Piedmont, Ariz., (population: 48) turns out to be the latest Scoop satellite--newly returned from a disastrously successful mission.  Only two of the locals, a crying baby and a crotchety old man, escape the wave of sudden and bizarre deaths that follows.The events at Piedmont activate Project Wildfire, throwing together a team of four brilliant and idiosyncratic scientists.  The team descends into a laboratory bunker that's been painstakingly designed to allow a rigorous, wide-ranging and cutting-edge study of lethal organisms in total isolation.  Unfortunately, a simple but important imperfection in this splendid bunker mirrors the fallibility of the scientists working in it.This is a story not of machines and computers, but of men who must deal with a heart-stopping crisis. Told in retrospect, as if the events described were a matter of record, The Andromeda Strain cagily discloses the scientists' mistakes as well as their breakthroughs. As the pressure builds and the clock ticks down, readers are left in anxious suspense over how these remarkable men at the end of their rope will prevent total catastrophe.Mixing suspense and science fictionMichael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain is a science fiction landmark. On its surface, it's the prototype of the techno-thriller, the forerunner not only of Richard Preston's The Hot Zone but also of Tom Clancy and Dean Koontz. It's also, at its core, one of the purest specimens of science fiction on bookshelves today.  This book explores not imagined worlds in far-off galaxies, but where science leads humanity, and where humanity leads science.Crichton crafts a story that's unhurried but immediate, carefully researched but with an everyday plausibility that strikes close to home.  There's nothing extraneous: even where he seems to dally for a moment, he's surreptitiously building the story around readers brick by brick, shunting them deeper into the tale.  His cleanness and clearness in exposing the raw humanity of his characters pays off in a climax that feels like a shot of adrenaline.Crichton's effort to explain technologies that were new or theoretical in 1969 ought to make the narration feel quaint and dated.  Instead, these explanations are written in such a way that the advanced capabilities of the Wildfire laboratory are placed in context, allowing readers to react to each innovation with contemporary eyes.  This is the key to making a techno-thriller, which might have fallen flat over time (once things like computer time-sharing were old news), into an engrossing time capsule not only of technologies but of attitudes and expectations.  (The complete absence of substantive female characters, while troubling, may be viewed in this context as well: The scientific establishment's boy's-club mentality was still a potent force in 1969.)Compared with the turgid, commercial works of today, The Andromeda Strain stands out as a singular achievement both for science fiction and for Crichton himself.For any fan of taut, suspenseful science fiction, The Andromeda Strain is a must-read. -- Mark	0
https://www.snopes.com/robert-gallo-invented-hiv-aids/	Did the Man Who Discovered the HIV Virus Confess to ‘Inventing’ It?	false	['aids', ' anti news network', ' conspiracy theories', ' fake news', ' hiv', ' robert gallo', ' your news wire']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/K4IWw	2017/06/12	 Post Views: 29,290Dr. Gallo: “I Invented AIDS To Depopulate Humanity”:Dr. Robert Gallo, the scientist credited with ‘discovering’ the HIV virus in 1984, has admitted that he created AIDS in order to reduce the world’s population. In 1984, Gallo filed a U.S. patent application for his invention of the HIV/AIDS virus.Dailypost.co.za   reports:Normally, when a patent is filed and approved, as Dr. Gallo’s was, anyone who uses the product or invention owes a royalty payment to the artificer.Thus, holding the intellectual property laws to their fullest interpretations, one must solely marvel why Dr. Gallo has yet to file a proceedings seeking to recover damages from the usage of his invention? As odd as this state of affairs could sound, it bears need for extra scrutiny.The scientific evidence is complete and compelling, the AIDS Virus is a designer bi-product of the U.S. Special Virus program. The Special Virus program was a federal virus development program that persisted in the U.S from 1962 until 1978…..The U.S. Special Virus was then added as ‘compliment’ to vaccinum inoculations in Africa and Manhattan. Shortly thereafter the world was engulfed with mass infections of somebody’s animal virus that differed from any illustrious human sickness, it was highly contagious and additional significantly,A review of the Special Virus Flow Chart (“research logic”) reveals the United States was seeking a ‘virus particle’ that might negatively impact the defense mechanisms of the system. The program sought to modify the ordination of the virus particle during which to splice in associate degree animal “wasting disease” referred to as “Visna”.According to the Proceedings of the us of America, AIDS is an biological process, laboratory development of the peculiar Visna Virus, first detected in Icelandic sheep. Recently, American and world scientists ensure with 100 percent certainty the laboratory genesis of AIDS.This fact is more underscored once one reviews the ‘multiply-spliced’ nature of the HIV ‘tat’ sequence and Dr. Gallo’s 1971 Special Virus paper, “Reverse Transcriptase of Type-C virus Particles of Human Origin”.Dr. Gallo’s 1971 Special Virus paper is identical to his 1984 announcement of AIDS. Upon further review the record reveals that he filed his patent on AIDS, before he made the announcement with Secretary troubler. Earlier this year, Dr. Gallo conceded his role as a ‘Project Officer’ for the federal virus development program, the Special Virus.The Flow Chart of the program and the 15 progress reports are undeniable proof of the United States’ game to cull world populations via the unleashing of a stealing biological organism that may ‘waste’ humanity.In light of this true genesis of the world’s most divesting biological scourge, it is the u. s. that owes ‘royal’ payments to the innocent victims. Each associated each victim of AIDS is worthy of a proper apology and a way of economic closure for an invention of death and despair, perpetrated by the United States.The eyes of the world are upon the overall Accounting Office’s Health Care Team, under the direction of William J. Scanlon. Between 1964 and 1978, the secret federal virus program spent $550 million dollars of payer cash to create AIDS. It is now necessary to pay no matter it takes to dismantle associate invention that has junction rectifier to the best crime against humanity within the history of the globe.	1

This week, the states Republican-led senate passed the so-called Mississippi Church Protection Act which would militarize the states churches while also walking back gun regulations and stripping away oversight.The bill would allow churches to create security programs and designate and train members to carry concealed weapons. It would provide criminal and legal protections to those serving as church security.The bill also would allow concealed carry in a holster without a permit in Mississippi, expanding a measure passed last year that allowed concealed carry without a permit in a purse, satchel or briefcase, and another recent law that allows open carry in public.The bill also seeks to prohibit Mississippi officials from enforcing any federal agency regulations or executive orders that would violate the state constitution  an attempt to federal gun restrictions not passed by Congress.Mississippi church goers will now get to assign church members as security which can carry concealed weapons without permits and are protected from legal liability if their actions result in death based on a designation of justifiable homicide  the same legal standing that we afford police officers on duty.@pourmecoffee It passed pic.twitter.com/H8WvOdHFA4 pourmecoffee (@pourmecoffee) March 30, 2016What could go wrong?Much of this baffling new legislation is in direct response to NRA lobbying directives to erode existing gun laws in order to create a polite society of heavily-armed citizens. Exploiting tragedy (and ignoring irony) the NRA has used recent mass shootings to push for more guns, not less.

Data suggests that as the number of guns increase, the risk of someone being shot by those guns also increases. Places with a lot of good guys with guns tend to have higher incidences of gun injuries. Go figure. At the same time, anecdotal evidence supports these warnings as well. Weve seen that guns in churches often lead to disastrous accidents, while at the same time not once stopping a mass shooting in a house of worship.With the removal of even permit requirements, Mississippi is planning on handing over the power of life and death to a bunch of untrained, untested amateurs who wont even have the risk of prosecution keeping their index finger off the trigger.

									 Update 12:20 pm 11/09/16: You can read our retraction and apology here. Update 11:16 AM 11/09/16: We have received reports that “pro-life” was removed from Trump’s list of policies several days ago or, counter to our understanding when this was published, may never have been there at all. Other pro-life content seems to have been removed from Trump’s site between Nov 6 and today. We will update further as soon as we have anything clearer than that. I mentioned this in my earlier post but I need to emphasize it right now. Less than half a day after Donald J. Trump was elected president of the United States, he removed the words “pro-life” from his list of policies on his official website. Have a look for yourself. Yes. The man who was always pro-abortion, who conveniently discovered the value of unborn human life after announcing his candidacy for president, has removed “pro-life” from his policies less than a day after using the pro-life movement and getting what he wanted from them. Congratulations to all of the staunch conservative “pro-lifers” who decided this was their one issue and the only way to achieve it was to vote Republican. Congratulations to everybody who called me a pro-abort when I said that ‘pro-life” leaders needed to repent of their Republican idolatry. He used you and dumped you, just as Steel Magnificat and anyone else with more sense than gravel predicted from the beginning. Now you know what his ex wives feel like. I hope you feel filthy. You elected a pro-abortion philandering racist narcissist, because you thought it was the only way to be “pro-life.”
	

	
You sold your birthright for a bowl of lentils and now you don’t get to eat the lentils either. I wonder if the disgraced perpetrator of public sacrilege Father Frank Pavone, who devoted the past year to getting Trump elected and who is currently under investigation by his bishop for desecrating a naked dead infant and a holy altar, still thinks he’s going to be put on Trump’s Catholic advisory board. As I’ve previously stated, if anyone wants to join with me in forming a movement that actually respects all life from conception until natural death, I’m keen, but I feel like I should never use “pro-life” without scare quotes again. The “pro-life” movement as it stands today is nothing but a group of Republican shills and they’ve gotten exactly what they deserved.

https://www.snopes.com/john-mccain-fire-uss-forrestal/	Did John McCain Cause a Fire Aboard the USS Forrestal that Killed 134 People?	false	['john mccain', ' uss forrestal', ' uss forrestal fire']	https://www.dailykos.com/	https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2008/9/12/596595/-	2017/10/24	"In 1967, the USS Forrestal suffered near catastrophic damage from a fire that raged on-board for nearly two days. John McCain was stationed on the Forrestal at the time and was quite likely responsible for the fire that killed 134 sailors and injured 62 others. Hot dog pilots were well known for their ""wet-starts,"" a process which allows fuel to build up in the engine before hitting the plane's start switch. The result of the wet-start is a long flame erupting from the tail of the plane. It was done simply for effect, a showy procedure meant to draw attention to the pilot. On June 29, 1967, John McCain is alleged to have used a wet-start to ""shake up"" a pilot in the plane behind him. The result was a fired rocket, dropped bombs and a fire that raged for nearly two days. 134 sailors lost their lives and another 62 were badly injured. McCain never had to answer for the incident. His father and grandfather were Navy admirals with a great deal of sway. Three months after the Forrestal disaster McCain was shot down over North Vietnam. You know the rest of the story. Is this man a maverick or a dangerous lunatic? Should we wait until he is president to know the answer?"	1

Secret Service agents rushed the stage to protect the billionaire business mogul.Thomas Dimassimo was identified as the barrier jumper. He was charged with inducing panic and disorderly conduct, Montgomery County Sheriff Phil Plummer said.Trump’s path continued onto Kansas City, Mo. where he was interrupted numerous times. At least seven individuals stalled the rally in the first few minutes.""I think they're Bernie [Sanders] supporters,"" Trump said of the protesters, pointing to at least one protester the Republican frontrunner said was holding a sign in support of the Democratic presidential candidate.Trump canceled his rally at the University of Illinois at Chicago on Friday after violence broke out in the arena where he was scheduled to speak. He spoke later to Fox News, saying he canceled the event because he didn’t want to see “people get hurt.”He said he made the decision to cancel after meeting with law enforcement authorities. Trump also said his First Amendment rights had been violated.Hours earlier, Trump supporters and opponents stood calmly in a line together waiting to get inside. Police horses and barricades kept the bulk of the demonstrators across the street.Trump opponents were protesting what they called his divisive comments, particularly about Muslims and Mexicans. Dozens of UIC faculty and staff had petitioned university administrators to cancel the rally, citing concerns it would create a ""hostile and physically dangerous environment.""At one point, nearly 20 officers who had been manning barricades suddenly bolted for an intersection across a street bridge over a freeway -- where protesters shouted at and jostled with police already there. An officer was seen walking from that intersection with blood on his head.For Sunday, Trump is expected to make a stop in Bloomington, Illinois. He is expected to be met with more protests and local officials said they would be deploying extra police.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Advertisement"	0

As a teen, he dreamed of becoming an anthropologist and later an illustrator, which his father, the owner of a stationery store, called ""not a proper occupation."" But Lucas is sure that the Force was always with him. ""I believe that even if I had become an anthropologist, I still would've started making movies and ended up right where I am now,"" he says. ""This path has been too strongly etched, and it's too winding."" While he has been wandering, we've been wondering:

Q: You're only now making the beginning of the Star Wars series. Why didn't you start with the beginning in 1977, instead of with Episode IV? A: Originally when I wrote Star Wars, it was meant to be one episode of a Saturday-matinee serial and you came in in the middle of it. I wrote a couple of screenplays, and they got very big, so I took the first act and made a movie out of that, but I swore to make the rest of the movie in three parts. In order to do that, I had to write a back story, so I said maybe I'll do the prequels. Q: You started out as an avant-garde director. How did you end up making movies for 12-year-olds? A: American Graffiti got so successful, I thought, Gee, making films for younger people actually is not a bad thing. I've always been very curious about culture, how a society develops its own equilibrium. I realized we were out of equilibrium at some point. We had reached a period in terms of our society of not having a mythology, a code that you pass down to the next generation. Friendship is valuable, honor is valuable. There wasn't a movie genre like that aimed at younger people, the 12-year-olds coming of age. Q: The morals we learn from Darth Vader's lifeabout letting go and making amendsare dominant themes in 12-step programs. Did you ever go through recovery for drugs or alcohol? A: I never did drugs. Drinking was never a problem. But I've done a lot of research, and those [morals] are very valid. The interesting thing about the 12 steps is that they work, and not just for addictive people. I'm very interested in psychology. I dabble in that stuff with my friends. I spend most of my fun time arguing, pontificating, discussing those things. Q: What religion are you? A: I was raised Methodist. Now let's say I'm spiritual. It's Marin County. We're all Buddhists up here. Q: Do you read reviews? A: I gave up reading reviews a long time ago. It's become a medium that is more like gossip. Q: Do you read about Star Wars on the Internet? A: When I was working on Phantom Menace, I saw a lot of the Internet stuff. I lasted about six weeks. Q: Why do the women in your movies have such crazy hairdos? A: In the 1977 film, I was working very hard to create something different that wasn't fashion, so I went with a kind of Southwestern Pancho Villa woman revolutionary look, which is what that is. The buns are basically from turn-of-the-century Mexico. Then it took such hits and became such a thing. In the new trilogy, the same thing applies, to try and do something timeless. I'm just basically having a good time.

The victims, all black men in their early 20s, were torn limb from limb and fed to Scott’s impressive collection of deadly reptiles.While she refused to answer questions, her lawyer did disclose that Ms. Scott was the victim of several black men in her early 20s:“One left when she got pregnant, forcing her to abort. One took everything she owned and slipped out in the middle of the night and the last one, when she told him about her misfortune and told him she wanted to go slow, raped her and got away with it.My client has a reason to dislike young, attractive black men.”Some would agree. Most would also say that just because you’re the victim of hood rats and thugs doesn’t give you the right to go and murder people. Maybe if it were self-defense, but she lured all of her subsequent victims with marijuana and home cooking. She recorded every moment.The case against her will certainly ruin Senator Montgomery, as much of the carnage happened when he was the governor of Delaware right in the Executive Mansion. The Delaware Attorney general says she will definitely be seeking the death penalty. Join America's Last Line of Defense And Share This Article Now!2.3k	1

Read moreStrange is facing a runoff election on Tuesday for the GOP nomination to hold the seat he was appointed to in February. The former state attorney general was handed the seat after former senator Jeff Sessions was appointed attorney general by Trump. Strange is currently trailing in the polls against Roy Moore, an ardent social conservative who has twice been removed as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court.The race has become a top priority for Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and a superPAC affiliated with him will spend over $9m on Stranges behalf. The Alabama senator is seen as reliable vote for Republican priorities while Moore has mused about making homosexual conduct illegal and suggested that the terrorist attacks of 11 September may have been divine retribution for the United States turning away from God. The campaign has largely focused on McConnell. Moore has attacked the Senate majority leader as a creature of the swamp that Trump wishes to drain while Strange has tried to distance himself from the Kentucky Republican. Strange went as far as to assert in his brief introductory remarks on Friday night that Trump was backing him so that he could have the votes in the Senate to stand up to Mitch McConnell. The President later asserted that Strange didnt know the Senate majority leader. Trump repeatedly praised Strange and often calling the 69ft senator Big Luther. However, he did note that Moore, who has been backed by a number of prominent conservatives including former Trump aide Steve Bannon, was a good man and that he would campaign for him if the former chief justice won on Tuesday. Instead of direct criticism, Trump simply claimed Moore would a face a difficult general election in deep red Alabama. He said Moore has a very good chance of not winning a general election. Trump also dwelled on the political risk he was taking backing Strange, insisting that the media would attack him if the Alabama Republican lost.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Senator Strange prepares to introduce the President Trump during the rally in Huntsville. Photograph: Marvin Gentry/ReutersIn between his praise of Strange, Trump touched on a smorgasbord of topics. He renewed his criticism of Kim Jong-un, whom he called both Rocket Man and Little Rocket Man and warning of the risk posed by North Koreas nuclear program and its recent threats to test a hydrogen bomb. Now hes talking about a massive weapon exploding over the Pacific Ocean, which causes calamity. Where the plume goes, so goes cancer, so goes tremendous problems. However, Trump confidently said Im going to handle it.Hours after John McCain torpedoed Republican hopes to repeal and replace Obamacare, Trump expressed his disappointment. He said McCains opposition was totally unexpected and terrible. He also chided the Arizona Republican for what he saw as hypocrisy. Repeal and replace, John McCain if you look at his last campaign its all about repeal and replace and thats fine, we still have a good chance [of repealing and replacing Obamacare. He described his attempts to court senators on health care, saying Im on the phone screaming at people all day long for weeks.Trump also returned to some of his favourite topics. He talked at length about the wall he hopes to build on the Mexican border, insisting it needed to be see-through. Trump said this was because drug dealers are currently using catapults to send 100 pound bags of drugs over the existing concrete wall and they are landing on peoples heads in the United States. He also responded the familiar cheers of lock her up directed at Hillary Clinton by telling the crowd you gotta speak to Jeff Sessions about that.The president also dwelled on NFL players who take a knee during the National Anthem in peaceful protest. He asked the crowd, Wouldnt you love one of the NFL owners when someone disrespects our flag, get that son of a bitch off the field right now. He told attendees, If you see it, leave the stadium, I guarantee things will stop. Since 2016, a number of African American NFL players have taken a knee during the National Anthem. It was spurred by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who was the first to do so in protest what he saw as oppression of people of color. Several other players have since followed suit and it has sparked national controversy.Trumps visit to Alabama comes just four days before the primary runoff and only hours after Ben Carson, a member of Trumps cabinet, issued a quasi-endorsement of Moore. In a statement issued by Moores campaign, Trumps secretary of housing and urban development said Judge Moore is a fine man of proven character and integrity, who I have come to respect over the years.

Does one have to be over 40 years unemployed not married and not procreated. Also does one have to scout the internet for 14 hours a day reading about weird stuf reposting this in an own theory? Maybe I am the best Conspiracy theorist the world has ever seen. I hold a golden nugget of secret super classified information. I am going to spill a small bean of the master plan. It is up to the second best conspiracy theorist to find my jar. So we all talk about the illuminati but what do we actually know. I for one can tell you every women that gives birth to a child is actually an officer in the illuminati procreation wing of the establishment. They are made to breed on a pure and mixed illuminati new arian order. This order is being brainwashed by there mothers. The mothers are created around the Atlantic ocean where the lizard people from Planet X landed and still live . These lizard people are actually close relatives to the bildenbergers who made the shell corporation in contract with the lizard people. Its actually very easy because the lizardpeople live in the ground the have created an easy to mine and easy to create power source named OIL. What I am trying to say is that the lizard people produce oil which is not a fossil fuel in contract with the Bilderbergers to create a dependency around the world. Without us knowing we are actually enslaved by the lizard people. If we look close in the religions there is a little hint at who could be the lizard people. Ask yourself who has all the oil also who covers a part of their civilization in burkas to cover up there lizardpeople like trait from the rest of the humanity?"	0

https://www.snopes.com/tourist-assaulted-orangutan/	Was an Irish Tourist ‘Savagely Raped’ by a Huge Orangutan?	false	['fake news', ' indonesia', ' orangutan', ' world news daily report']	https://archive.is/	https://archive.is/fbLV5	2017/04/26	initialinitialinitialsinitial TweetKalimantan | An ecologist’s dream to watch orangutans in their natural habitat quickly turned into his worst nightmare after being savagely attacked and raped by a 400-pound orangutan in the jungle of Borneo.Zack O’Reilly, a young 26-year-old from Ireland, who is presently studying biology at Dublin city University and has been a Greenpeace activist for the past three years, had always dreamed of seeing orangutans in their natural habitat and was a strong advocate against the palm oil industry, which is a great threat to the endangered species.“ He always dreamed of seeing orangutans in the jungle. I used to tease him, saying he looked like one and that he’d find his soulmate in the jungle. Never would I have thought he would be sexually assaulted by one ”– Kelly O’Reilly, motherThe young man was quickly brought back to a missionary hospital near Kalimantan where he lay unconscious for many hours and where doctors found traces of internal bleeding.Kelly O’Reilly, the victim’s mother, says she used to tease him, telling her son he looked like a orangutan, but she never suspected he would be sexually assaulted by one, she told reporters in tearsFamiliar traitsKekbek Mahlouiak, one of the tour guides present on the dramatic trip, says he has warned various tourists to be careful around the animals.“I specifically told him to wear a hat and hide his orange hair, that it could entice the orangutans. I’m not surprised of what has happened, I warned him many times. He did not listen,” he told local reporters.“It is very dangerous for people with orange hair, the males get very excited. A male followed us deep into the jungle many kilometers, he was very aggressive. There is nothing I could do,” he added.An isolated incidentA spokeswoman for the Borneo Tourism Board said it is the first time an orangutan has physically assaulted a tourist on one of their jungle treks.“We are deeply horrified and saddened by the whole affair. We have offered the young victim a free tour if he ever wishes to come back again and will provide increased security for our travelers in the future,” she added.A similar incident was previously reported in a Jakarta zoo in 2014, when a young red-haired woman was hospitalized after an orangutan broke out of its cage and tried to mate with the visitor, resulting in the death of the animal by zoo employees.	1
https://www.snopes.com/uber-increase-london-attack/	Did Uber Increase its Prices in London After a Terror Attack?	mixture	['london', ' london attack', ' uber']	http://money.cnn.com/	http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/04/technology/uber-london-attack-surge-pricing/index.html	2017/06/05	"Uber criticized for surge pricing after London terror attackby Charles Riley   @CRrileyCNN June 4, 2017: 8:59 AM ETLondon terror attacks: How they unfoldedUber has been accused of taking too long to turn off its ""surge pricing"" feature after a deadly terror attack in the heart of London.App users complained that they were being charged inflated prices on Saturday night after a van plowed into pedestrians on London Bridge and three knife-wielding men attacked revelers in a nearby nightlife district.The backlash was intense on social media, where commentators said that Uber should have immediately disabled surge pricing for people trying to make their way home across the capital.""Hey @Uber -- you're really going to surge price x2.1 during a terrorist attack in #London???"" said one Twitter user. ""Lower than low.""Hey @Uber -- you're really going to surge price x2.1 during a terrorist attack in #London ??? Lower than low. #londonbridge #emergency pic.twitter.com/yXHFZsYZkT— Amber Clemente (@yankeeamber) June 3, 2017Another said: ""Big fan of @Uber but bitterly disappointed in profiting from a terrorist attack.""Tom Elvidge, the general manager of Uber in London, said the company would not charge users for rides taken from areas near the attack. He also defended the company's response.""As soon as we heard about the incident we immediately suspended dynamic pricing all around the area of the attacks -- and shortly afterward across the whole of central London -- just as we did following the attacks in Manchester and Westminster,"" he said.Uber fares are calculated using an algorithm that reacts to demand. The controversial pricing model, which is designed to lure drivers to areas where demand is high, is typically suspended during disasters and emergencies.But the company has been criticized for not acting quickly enough.On Saturday, the first calls to emergency services in London were made at 10:08 p.m. Uber said it had disabled surge pricing in the immediate area of the attack by 10:50 p.m. and extended the suspension to include all of central London by 11:40 p.m.Forty-eight people were injured in the attack and at least seven were killed. Police officers pursued and shot dead three attackers within eight minutes of the first emergency call, London police said.CNNMoney (London) First published June 4, 2017: 8:59 AM ET"	1
