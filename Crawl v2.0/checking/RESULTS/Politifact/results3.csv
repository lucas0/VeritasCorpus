It was fitting that the quarterback capped off the weeks demonstrations, seeing as he was the one who launched the largest social justice protest the NFL has ever seen.But he was far from alone. Seventeen other players across the league joined him by kneeling or raising their fists during the playing of the national anthem before their games to draw attention to police brutality against minorities and spur conversations about social justice. The Seahawks Jeremy Lane opted to sit during the preseason, but joined in his teams demonstration of locking arms on Sunday instead.Here are a few striking photos that captured the moments.1.

In August 2016, prolonged rainfall in southern parts of the U.S. state of Louisiana resulted in catastrophic flooding that submerged thousands of houses and businesses. Louisiana's governor, John Bel Edwards, called the disaster a ""historic, unprecedented flooding event"" and declared a state of emergency. Many rivers and waterways, particularly the Amite and Comite rivers, reached record levels, and rainfall exceeded 20 inches (510 mm) in multiple parishes. Because of the large number of homeowners without flood insurance that were affected, the federal government is providing disaster aid through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The flood has been called the worst US natural disaster since Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Thirteen deaths have been reported as a result of the flooding. A map of radar-estimated rainfall accumulations across Louisiana between August 9 and 16, 2016; areas shaded in white indicate accumulations in excess of 20 in (510 mm). Early on August 11, a mesoscale convective system flared up in southern Louisiana around a weak area of low pressure that was situated next to an outflow boundary. It remained nearly stationary, and as a result, torrential downpours occurred in the areas surrounding Baton Rouge and Lafayette. Rainfall rates of up to 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) an hour were reported in the most deluged areas. Totals exceeded nearly 2 feet (61 cm) in some areas as a result of the system remaining stationary. Accumulations peaked at 31.39 inches (797 mm) in Watson, just northeast of Baton Rouge. The Washington Post noted that the ""no-name storm"" dumped three times as much rain on Louisiana as Hurricane Katrina. It dropped the equivalent of 7.1 trillion gallons of water or enough to fill Lake Pontchartrain about four times. Hurricane Katrina, by comparison, dumped about 2.3 trillion gallons of rainwater in the state (though more in other states). The flood also dumped more water than Hurricane Isaac. According to the National Weather Service Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center, the amount of rainfall in the hardest-hit locations had a less than 0.1 percent chance of happening or was a (less than) 1-in-1,000-year event. Because the rain did not fall from a named storm, there was less warning to the public for emergency preparations. GPM provides a closer look at the Louisiana floods. A rapid attribution study that was published within one month after the event  indicates an anthropogenic climate warming role in the increased probability of the return time of a similar extreme event happening in the future. A follow-on peer-reviewed paper  indicates that the catastrophic flood in Louisiana was a result of intense precipitation produced by a slow-moving tropical low pressure system interacting with an eastward-traveling baroclinic trough to the north. While tropical-midlatitude interactions of this nature are rare, they are not unprecedented. Analyses presented point towards the tendency for more and perhaps stronger upper level troughs propagating out of the western U.S. in summer; these then have an increasing potential to cross paths with low pressure systems that form around the Gulf Coast. Combined with the projected increase in precipitable water, resulting precipitation magnitude would increase. Large-ensemble modeling indicates that the prospect of future tropical-midlatitude interactions is a scenario that Louisiana will face in the future. Regional simulations suggest that the climate warming since 1985 may have increased the event precipitation (11-14 August 2016) on the order of 20%. Rainfall like this and the emergency help needed after the flooding subsides are straining the federal system for aid to states; some wonder if this is the new normal for storms and floods. Flooding began in earnest on August 12. On August 13, a flash flood emergency was issued for areas along the Amite and Comite rivers. By August 15, more than ten rivers (Amite, Vermilion, Calcasieu, Comite, Mermentau, Pearl, Tangipahoa, Tchefuncte, Tickfaw, and Bogue Chitto) and many more had reached a moderate, major, or record flood stage. Eight rivers reached record levels including the Amite and Comite rivers. The Amite River crested at nearly 5 ft (1.5 m) above the previous record in Denham Springs. Nearly one-third of all homes—approximately 15,000 structures—in Ascension Parish were flooded after a levee along the Amite River was overtopped. Water levels began to slowly recede by August 15, though large swaths of land remained submerged.Livingston Parish was one the hardest hit areas; an official estimated that 75 percent of the homes in the parish were a ""total loss"". It was thought over 146,000 homes were damaged in Louisiana. This mass flooding also damaged thousands of businesses. Thirteen people have been confirmed dead as a consequence of the flooding. The latest, according to WBRZ, is an elderly woman in Livingston Parish. Parish officials confirmed her death. A man's body was found Wednesday on Whitehall Avenue in Denham Springs. Officials said they found a man in his 50's in the South Point subdivision off of Walker South. They added the man had no obvious signs of trauma, and the area he was found in had five-feet of water in it at one point. Of the other deaths, five people have died in East Baton Rouge Parish, three in Tangipahoa Parish, two in St. Helena Parish, two in Livingston Parish and one in Rapides Parish from the storms and their aftermath. The US Coast Guard coordinating rescue operations with the St. Amant Fire Department in the Baton Rouge area. The widespread flooding stranded tens of thousands of people in their homes and vehicles. At least 30,000 people were evacuated by local law enforcement, firefighters, the Louisiana National Guard, the Coast Guard and fellow residents, from submerged vehicles and flooded homes. Many boat-owning residents of Louisiana and Mississippi, together with other volunteers, formed an informal rescue service known as the Cajun Navy and navigated through flooded areas to answer calls for help that they received via social media. They rescued as many as a thousand people and pets and distributed emergency supplies. A group of 70 volunteers from St. Bernard Parish conducted hundreds of boat rescues in East Baton Rouge Parish. By August 15, approximately 11,000 people sought refuge in 70 shelters. Flash flooding swamped a 7-mile (11 km) section of Interstate 12 between Tangipahoa Parish and Baton Rouge, stranding 125 vehicles. At one point, an approximately 62-mile stretch was closed because of flooding concerns. State police and the National Guard used high-water vehicles to rescue trapped motorists, but many remained stuck for over 24 hours. A cellular network outage complicated rescues over the affected area. On August 12, a state of emergency was activated for the whole of Louisiana. The Baton Rouge River Center served as a shelter for hundreds of displaced flood victims. With an estimated 146,000 homes damaged in the flooding—characterized as the worst US natural disaster since Hurricane Sandy in 2012—thousands of Louisianians were forced into shelters, with more than 11,000 in state-operated shelters. This prompted an estimated 1,500 American Red Cross volunteers to travel to Louisiana, along with other groups to send volunteers such as Louisiana State University, the Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New Orleans, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Celebration Church, Grace Church of Central, and the Church of Scientology. There were media reports of one man who cooked 108 pounds (49 kg) of brisket for displaced people. The Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals attempted to rescue stray pets, and the Second Harvest Food Bank and the United Way of Southeast Louisiana sent supplies and food. More than 109,398 individuals and households have registered for FEMA assistance. FEMA has approved $132 million for assistance. Singer Beyoncé, along with sister Solange and Kelly Rowland, held an event to help raise money for those affected by the floods in Baton Rouge. They raised more than $4 million thanks to their presence. In addition, singer Taylor Swift donated $1 million to Louisiana's relief fund. Another singer, Lady Gaga, donated an unspecified amount of money. On August 13, the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters was activated by the USGS, allowing for the humanitarian redeployment of satellite assets by the international community.AT&T donated US$100,000 to be split between the Baton Rouge Area Foundation and DonorsChoose.org for flood relief.Randy Jackson and Harry Connick Jr. were scheduled to host a benefit concert at the Baton Rouge River Center Theatre on September 5, featuring over a dozen artists; all proceeds are going to the American Red Cross Louisiana Flood Relief fund. On the ""Ellen"" show Friday (Sept. 9), host Ellen DeGeneres announced that she and Britney Spears would each donate $125,000 to help victims of the Louisiana Flood of 2016. Both celebrities are from Louisiana. Spears gave $125,000 to the Louisiana Red Cross to buy a new emergency response vehicle. DeGeneres received a letter from Betsey Baldwin, a P.E. teacher at Galvez Middle School in Ascension parish, which was inundated with two feet of water. The school has 620 students, who after the floods have been forced to study at another, nearby school. ""I thought of one person that would help me, and it was you,"" Baldwin said. The company Shutterfly, at the request of DeGeneres, donated $125,000 to help Galvez Middle School recover. Since the start of the floods, around 265,000 children have been out of school, nearly 30% of the school-aged population in the state of Louisiana. The initiation of the school year has been difficult due to the direct damage many schools received, the damage of many teachers' homes, and the large number of students in between homes after being displaced by the floods. There were reports that 6 schools were heavily flooded in East Baton Rouge Parish with another 15 in Livingston Parish. Livingston Parish's Superintendent, Rick Wentzel, believes that their school system is in a similar position compared to the Northshore following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and he held a meeting with the school district to discuss possible options. Livingston Parish conducted a teacher survey August 23–24, and a parent survey August 25 to assess how those are affected, and on Friday, August 26, 2016, Superintendent Rick Wentzel announced that Livingston Parish Public Schools will be resuming class on September 12, 2016. Wentzel, who was affected by the flooding himself, said he was ""very pleased"" that all schools will be resuming together. The late restart date is because LPPS received the most extensive damage with eight of the 15 flooded schools having ""extensive damage"". Wentzel said that each school will have a welcome back event for parents and students before returning on September 12, 27 school days following the August 4th start date. Wentzel said that the restart will have some unfortunate ""side effects"" as some schools will be temporarily platooned. The exact school and class times will be announced at a later date, but it is known that Denham Springs High School will be at Live Oak High School, Denham Springs Freshman High will be at Live Oak Middle School, Southside Junior High will be at Juban Parc High School, and Springfield High School will be at Springfield Middle School. LPSB announced that all host and platooned schools will follow a similar time for class. All host schools will be in session from 6:30 am until 11:40 am and all platooned schools will be in class from 2:25 pm until 5:37 pm. The two elementary schools will be in class alongside their relocated school. It is unknown if class sizes will be increased or where the extra students will be held. It is known, however, that Denham Springs Elementary will be split among Eastside Elementary (Grades: PreK, K, 1, 2) and Freshwater Elementary (Grades: 3, 4, 5) while Southside Elementary will be split among Lewis Vincent Elementary (Grades: PreK, K, 1) and Juban Parc Elementary (Grades: 2, 3, 4, 5). This announcement also came with Superintendent Wentzel saying ALL students will receive free lunch until September 30. Following a school board meeting on Thursday, September 9, Assistant Superintendent Stephen Parill announced the ""known and confident updates"" for the 2016 Academic Calendar. Only four changes were made to the calendar that include: changing Thursday, September 15 from a half-day to a whole day, removing the parish fair holiday on Friday, October 7 (the fair was cancelled due to the flooding), removing a parent-teacher conference day on Thursday, October 20, and making Wednesday, November 16 a whole day instead of a half-day. The board also voted to add class time to the day. Parill said they are still waiting on their appeal to Louisiana BESE waiving the required minutes of class, and any further changes will be made after BESE's ruling. For the entire state, superintendent John White said that at least 22 schools had heavy damage and will need time to recover. There were also many school closures due to flooding in the Lafayette area as well. Transportation will also pose a challenge, as many kids were displaced from their homes and many school buses were damaged from flood water. Many teachers' homes flooded, with 4,000 staff members' homes in Baker sustaining damage and another 2,000 in East Baton Rouge Parish. East Baton Rouge Parish schools announced they won't open back up until September 6, 25 days after school was originally canceled for the floods on August 12, the third day of school. The Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women (LCIW), located in St. Gabriel and the sole Louisiana state prison for women, had 985 prisoners at the time of the flooding. The prison experienced flooding ranging from 8 inches (200 mm) to 3 feet (0.91 m). LCIW, the only state-operated prison to receive flooding during the incident, temporarily closed. It was the first time in state history that the whole population of a particular prison was evacuated to other facilities. As of 2017[update] the prisoners are still housed in other prisons.Elayn Hunt Correctional Center, next to LCIW, was not evacuated. Damages were anticipated to reach $10-15 billion, with this storm likely ranking as the seventh most expensive of natural disasters in the US since 1978. Because many of the areas that flooded were not in ""high flood risk areas"", the majority of homeowners affected by the flood did not have flood insurance. Across Louisiana, about 21% of all structures have coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program. Despite this, in many parishes that percentage is much lower. In St. Helena Parish, which was among the hardest hit parishes by the floods, less than 1% of all homeowners had flood insurance. Because of the large number of homeowners without flood insurance that were affected, the federal government is providing disaster aid through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The flood has been called the worst US natural disaster since Hurricane Sandy in 2012. FEMA, which has stepped in to help homeowners without flood insurance, has declared these 20 parishes as federal disaster areas: Acadia, Ascension, Avoyelles, East Baton Rouge, East Feliciana, Evangeline, Iberia, Iberville, Jefferson Davis, Lafayette, Livingston, Pointe Coupee, St. Helena, St. Landry, St. Martin, St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Vermilion, Washington, and West Feliciana. Homeowners with damage from the floods in those parishes are eligible for up to $33,000 in federal disaster aid and so far around 102,000 people have applied for help. For business continuity and community rebuilding, private mobile flood recovery centers have also been made available, including a 10-piece modular building complex used in Baton Rouge by FEMA as a portable school for children of displaced families who moved north from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. The national media has been criticized by many leaders in Louisiana for lack of media coverage of the floods, especially compared to other major natural disasters. This seems to have happened because of the heavy coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics and the 2016 U.S. presidential election, along with the fact that the storm did not have a name since it was not a tropical storm nor hurricane. In fact, the storm was not even a tropical depression, the lowest level a tropical system can have. The Times-Picayune expressed their frustrations in an article and noted that CNN and The New York Times had not covered the floods until late Sunday August 14, despite widespread flooding starting on August 12. During the floods, President Barack Obama was on vacation in Martha's Vineyard. On August 18, an editorial in The Advocate criticized the president for not coming to Louisiana during the crisis. However, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards defended the president's handling of the emergency, saying that he had been talking to him daily and that a visit by the president would require road closures for his motorcade and distract first responders when rescues are still underway. On August 23, 2016, Obama visited the Baton Rouge area and made a speech, along with meeting residents affected by the floods. In his speech he said that the floods were not a photo op issue and that ""after the TV cameras leave, the whole country is going to continue to support"" the Louisiana. During his visit he also took the time to visit the family of Alton Sterling and the families of the slain police officers who were killed in a shooting earlier in the summer following unrest in Baton Rouge. Initially, presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump also faced criticism for paying little to no attention to the floods. On August 19, 2016, four days before the President's visit, Trump and his running mate Mike Pence toured the flooded areas. Trump visited affected families in St. Amant, a community southeast of Baton Rouge, and handed supplies from an 18-wheeler truck from a local church. Hillary Clinton said she would not visit Louisiana in the near future, saying that her political campaign would cause distraction, though said she wanted Louisianans to have the resources they needed. High school football brought national coverage of the damage from the floods in September 2016. The focus was the local high school football teams in Livingston Parish. ESPN was ""shining a spotlight"" on Denham Springs High School's football program's rebound following the flooding. DSHS had to forfeit their first game against East Ascension in wake of the flooding, and opened the season at home against Tara. On the night of Thursday, September 8, DSHS hosted a pep rally to get fans and students ready for the upcoming season. During the pep rally, ESPN Sportscenter recorded various clips and interviews that are set to play every hour between 7 am and noon on Friday (September 9). ESPN also held two ""live remote feeds"" covering pregame at Yellow Jacket Stadium from 5-6 pm airing on Sportscenter and ESPN2. Sportscenter ended their national coverage of the flood on Saturday morning (September 10) by having a live broadcast at James Grill in Denham Springs, Louisiana from 6-8am.

He told Politico that his resignation was not in any way related to scandal. Not in any way shape or form. Ive been given more enemas by more people over the last eight years than you can possibly imagine. From the Secret Service to the Democratic Party. I am who I am. If they had something really scandalous, it wouldve come out a long, long time ago.Well, it would be true that it would have come out a long, long time ago had the FBI been investigating Russian money laundering by people involved in the American political process. But until Donald Trump came along, there werent really any major questions about such things in our political process. But we will get into that in a bit.The real scandal here is that somebody wanted to sleep with Jason ChaffetzAnother revelation is that Jason Chaffetz wants to spend more time with his family because he is allegedly having an affair.Latest from a well placed Congressional source is that @jasoninthehouse multi year affair with a woman was about to be revealed. https://t.co/Dg4hKCRtbZ Claude Taylor (@TrueFactsStated) April 20, 2017Just in case you arent familiar with Claude Taylor, he is a veteran of three presidential campaigns and was a White House staffer for the Clinton administration. He also served in the Obama administration. And this is just one piece of possible Russian kompromat on Jason Chaffetz.A 2nd source is claiming that the Russians knew about Chaffetz's affair and were blackmailing him. https://t.co/Dg4hKCzRNp Claude Taylor (@TrueFactsStated) April 20, 2017Chaffetz and Comeys leaked letterChaffetz is also the person responsible for leaking James Comeys letter to the public over the Clinton e-mail scandal. The press continually blamed Comey but the real culprit that used that information to interfere in the election was none other than Jason Chaffetz. This garnered Chaffetz a big fat ethics complaint from Scott Dworkin of the Democratic Coalition.According to a statement from Dworkin: Representative Chaffetz, in an ill-planned partisan attempt, released information that compromised the integrity of the FBI, when he irresponsibly tweeted out that the case investigating Secretary Clintons emails had been reopened, when in fact, it had not been. Members of Congress are elected to make our country a safer, better place  not to use their power to work with leaders such as Comey in a partisan fashion. I hope that both are held accountable for their actions.Some reports also allege that Chaffetz received a check from Trump for a whopping $10 million bucks for leaking the letter. Money that was likely obtained through nefarious means. Russian money laundering, anyone?Chaffetz and Russian Money LaunderingAnother scandal comes amid allegations that Chaffetz along with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell were working on ways to get Russian money into the American political process via dark super PACs that would hide the origin of the money received.According to an article from The Daily Kos:...The laundering of Russian money does make a great deal of sense. Why? Because just a few days ago there was a lot of chatter about an audio tape the FBI took into evidence. This pre-election tape purports to be a recording of Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell discussing how best to wash Russian money through House and senate campaigns via dark money superPACs. Paul Ryans name has already been linked with the Russian hacking of voter data from swing states so money laundering on behalf of the Russians is not a big leap from there and would be entirely in character for both men. Certainly both were desperate to hold onto the power they knew was slipping through their fingers so both would have grabbed at any opportunity for big money assistance without caring much where it came from.That would also explain Chaffetzs desires to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics. After all, with the complaints filed and a looming FBI investigation, that particular office could prove to be quite the thorn in the side of Republicans looking to cover up the crimes of the Trump campaign.According to a report from The Failing New York Times:House Republicans, overriding their top leaders, voted on Monday to significantly curtail the power of an independent ethics office set up in 2008 in the aftermath of corruption scandals that sent three members of Congress to jail.The move to effectively kill the Office of Congressional Ethics was not made public until late Monday, when Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, announced that the House Republican Conference had approved the change. There was no advance notice or debate on the measure.Of course, they failed to gut the OCE due to public outcry but Republicans may still win the day when a new budget passes.So actually, yeah Jason, youre resigning because of a massive scandal. Just not one massive scandal. Unless, of course, Chaffetz doesnt think Russian money laundering is a scandal. We look forward to seeing him do the perp walk with his cohorts in the House and Senate.

Domestic assets are moving into defensive positions. POSSIBLY RELATED MATERIAL (UPDATES CONTINUE BELOW FOLLOWING THIS RELATED MATERIAL)American and Russian fighter jets had a tense showdown in the skies above Syria as the Russians dropped bombs on U.S.-backed rebels.U.S. and Russian fighter jets bloodlessly tangled in the air over Syria on June 16 as the American pilots tried and failed to stop the Russians from bombing U.S.-backed rebels in southern Syria near the border with Jordan.The aerial close encounter underscores just how chaotic Syria’s skies have become as Russia and the U.S.-led coalition work at cross-purposes, each dropping bombs in support of separate factions in the five-year-old civil war.The near-clash also highlights the escalating risk of American and Russian forces actually coming to blows over Syria, potentially sparking a much wider conflict between the world’s leading nuclear powers.The incident began when at least two twin-engine Su-34 bombers, some of Moscow’s most advanced warplanes, struck what the Pentagon described as a “border garrison”  housing around 200 U.S.-supported rebels in At Tanf on the Syrian side of the Syria-Jordan border.The rebels had been “conducting counter-ISIL operations in the area,” the Pentagon stated on June 18, using an alternative acronym for ISIS.The United States and its allies in Syria clearly did not expect the air strike. The rebels in At Tanf are party to a shaky ceasefire agreement between rebel forces and the regime of Syrian president Bashar Al Assad—and, by extension, the Russian military contingent backing Al Assad. The Los Angeles Times reported that Russian planes had not previously been active over At Tanf. The Su-34s’ initial strike wounded, and perhaps killed, some of the rebels in At Tanf.The U.S. Navy scrambled F/A-18 fighters to intercept the Russians, the Los Angeles Times reported. The Navy has deployed two aircraft carriers to the region for strikes on ISIS. As the F/A-18s approached the Su-34s, officials with U.S. Central Command—which oversees America’s wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan—used a special hotline to contact their Russian counterparts directing Russia’s own intervention in Syria.Arriving over At Tanf, the American pilots apparently spoke directly to the Russian aviators. “Pilots CAN communicate with one another on a communications channel set up to avoid air accidents,” Central Command confirmed in a statement to The Daily Beast.Washington and Moscow had established the hotline as part of a so-called “Safety of Flight Memorandum of Understanding” that the two governments signed in October specifically in order to avoid the kind of aerial confrontation that occurred over Syria last week.With the American jets flying close enough to visually identify the Su-34s, the Russians departed the air space over At Tanf. Some time shortly thereafter, the F/A-18s ran low on fuel and left the area in order to link up with an aerial tanker. That’s when the Su-34s reportedly returned to At Tanf —and bombed the rebels again.According to the Los Angeles Times, the second strike killed first-responders assisting survivors of the first bombing run.The next day, senior U.S. Defense Department officials organized an “extraordinary” video conference with Russian counterparts to discuss the incident. The meeting included Acting Assistant Secretary for International Security Affairs Elissa Slotkin and U.S. Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, a strategic planner on the Pentagon’s joint staff, plus unspecified Russian Ministry of Defense officials.“Department officials expressed strong concerns about the attack on the coalition-supported counter-ISIL forces at the At Tanf garrison, which included forces that are participants in the cessation of hostilities in Syria, and emphasized that those concerns would be addressed through ongoing diplomatic discussions on the cessation of hostilities,” Defense Department spokesman Peter Cook explained in a statement.""Regarding safety, department officials conveyed that Russia’s continued strikes at At Tanf, even after U.S. attempts to inform Russian forces through proper channels of on-going coalition air support to the counter-ISIL forces, created safety concerns for U.S. and coalition forces,” Cook continued. “Department officials requested Russian responses to address those concerns.”Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov confirmed, via the country’s state-owned media, that the teleconference took place—but he did not specify the results of the “extraordinary” meeting.Russian warplanes had previously shadowed planes belonging to the U.S.-led coalition over Syria, but the coalition always described the Russians’ behavior as “professional.” By contrast, in April Russian Su-24 bombers repeatedly buzzed the U.S. Navy warship USS Donald Cook while the vessel sailed in international waters in the Black Sea. A Pentagon spokesman called the Russians’ actions in that incident “provocative and unprofessional.”The Kremlin should be keenly aware of the potential for unwanted—and potentially destabilizing—bloodshed that exists in the air over Syria. In November, a Russian Su-24 bomber flying a mission over Syria strayed over the Syria-Turkey border into Turkey—and a Turkish F-16 fighter promptly shot it down .The two Russian crew members ejected. One flier died when Syrian rebels on the ground opened fire on his parachute. Russian, Syrian and Iranian forces launched a complex rescue mission that ultimately retrieved the surviving pilot. One Russian marine died and a helicopter was destroyed during that operation.The fallout from the November incident continues, with Russia and Turkey exchanging threats—and Moscow imposing economic sanctions on Ankarra including limits on some food imports to Russia from Turkey.It’s not clear how close the U.S. fighters came to attacking and potentially shooting down the Su-34s over At Tanf. Central Command declined to say what the rules of engagement are for American pilots flying over Syria. “ROE are actually specifics that we don’t get into,” Central Command said in a statement.The last time a U.S. military warplane shot down a Russian—actually, Soviet—plane was in 1953, over Korea or China, depending on which historians you believe. The last time a Russian or Soviet warplane shot down an American aircraft was in 1970, when a U.S. Army plane strayed over Armenia.#### RESUMING UPDATES . . . .At 4:32 AM EDT -- A huge explosion has struck an ammunition depot at a military firing range in southern Russia. The Defense Ministry said around 600 people have been evacuated.The incident took place at Ashuluk testing range near the city of Astrakhan in southern Russia. As of 6:23 EDT this morning Currently NATO has an abnormal ammount of fighters and c-130s up over europe.x10 F-16"	1

After more than two decades following a “no testing on animals” policy, cosmetics giants Avon, Mary Kay, and Estee Lauder have resumed the practice without letting consumers know. In the late 1980s, PETA’s “Avon Killing” campaign eventually led to the company banning animal testing for their products, with Mary Kay and Estée Lauder following suit.According to a press release from Rush PR, the news was broken after animal rights organization PETA removed the companies from their cruelty-free list after discovering that they had returned to using testing on animals for their products. The three companies began the tests again in order to satisfy regulations from the Chinese government so they could sell their products in China. However, PETA contends that there are alternative testing methods that are just as effective and widely used in the US.Kathy Guillermo, the Vice President of PETA’s Laboratory Investigations was saddened by the move: “Avon, Estée Lauder, and Mary Kay have regressed a generation: Their products are once again being dripped into rabbits’ eyes and smeared onto animals’ abraded skin.” She’s urging customers to choose cruelty-free products instead.Avon spokeswoman Reese Witherspoon may be upset to learn about the new animal testing as well. Late last year she was “dismayed” to learn a bag she was spotted with was made from real python skin and agreed to throw it away. But perhaps she can use her star power to influence Avon to go back to their animal-friendly ways.Keep You Up To Date On All Our Doggie News!Join our mailing list to receive the latest news and updates from Dog Files.SUBMIT!Thank you so much for subscribing to Dog Files!Share:	1
https://www.snopes.com/food/tainted/roundupwheat.asp	The Real Reason Wheat is Toxic	mixture	['asp article', ' gluten', ' monsanto', ' roundup', ' wheat']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/x6ljl	2014/12/25	The Real Reason Wheat is Toxic (it’s not the gluten)by Sarah Updated: February 20, 2017 Green Living Comments: 1,1011.9MShare Tweet Pin Email-The stories became far too frequent to ignore. Emails from folks with allergic or digestive issues to wheat in the United States experienced no symptoms whatsoever when they tried eating pasta on vacation in Italy.Confused parents wondering why wheat consumption sometimes triggered autoimmune reactions in their children but not at other times.Is Your Home Making You Sick?Get a free chapter of my book Living Green in an Artificial World + my newsletter and learn how to start creating a living environment that supports and enhances health!XIn my own home, I’ve long pondered why my husband can eat the wheat I prepare  at home, but he experiences negative digestive effects eating even a single roll in a restaurant.There is clearly something going on with wheat that is not well known by the general public. It goes far and beyond organic versus nonorganic, gluten or hybridization because even conventional wheat triggers no symptoms for some who eat wheat in other parts of the world.What indeed is going on with wheat?For quite some time, I secretly harbored the notion that wheat in the United States must, in fact, be genetically modified.  GMO wheat secretly invading the North American food supply seemed the only thing that made sense and could account for the varied experiences I was hearing about.I reasoned that it couldn’t be the gluten or wheat hybridization. Gluten and wheat hybrids have been consumed for thousands of years. It just didn’t make sense that this could be the reason for so many people suddenly having problems with wheat and gluten in general in the past 5-10 years.Finally, the answer came over dinner a couple of months ago with a friend who was well versed in the wheat production process. I started researching the issue for myself, and was, quite frankly, horrified at what I discovered.The good news is that the reason wheat has become so toxic in the United States is not because it is secretly GMO as I had feared (thank goodness!).The bad news is that the problem lies with the manner in which wheat is grown and harvested by conventional wheat farmers.You’re going to want to sit down for this one.  I’ve had some folks burst into tears in horror when I passed along this information before.Common wheat harvest protocol in the United States is to drench the wheat fields with Roundup several days before the combine harvesters work through the fields as the practice allows for an earlier, easier and bigger harvest.Pre-harvest application of the herbicide Roundup or other herbicides containing the deadly active ingredient glyphosate to wheat and barley as a desiccant was suggested as early as 1980.  It has since become routine over the past 15 years and is used as a drying agent 7-10 days before harvest within the conventional farming community.According to Dr. Stephanie Seneff of MIT who has studied the issue in depth and who I recently saw present on the subject at a nutritional Conference in Indianapolis, desiccating non-organic wheat crops with glyphosate just before harvest came into vogue late in the 1990’s with the result that most of the non-organic wheat in the United States is now contaminated with it.  Seneff explains that when you expose wheat to a toxic chemical like glyphosate, it actually releases more seeds resulting in a slightly greater yield:   “It ‘goes to seed’ as it dies. At its last gasp, it releases the seed” says Dr. Seneff.According to the US Department of Agriculture, as of 2012, 99% of durum wheat, 97% of spring wheat, and 61% of winter wheat has been treated with herbicides. This is an increase from 88% for durum wheat, 91% for spring wheat and 47% for winter wheat since 1998.Here’s what wheat farmer Keith Lewis has to say about the practice:I have been a wheat farmer for 50 yrs and one wheat production practice that is very common is applying the herbicide Roundup (glyposate) just prior to harvest. Roundup is licensed for preharvest weed control. Monsanto, the manufacturer of Roundup claims that application to plants at over 30% kernel moisture result in roundup uptake by the plant into the kernels. Farmers like this practice because Roundup kills the wheat plant allowing an earlier harvest.A wheat field often ripens unevenly, thus applying Roundup preharvest evens up the greener parts of the field with the more mature. The result is on the less mature areas Roundup is translocated into the kernels and eventually harvested as such.This practice is not licensed. Farmers mistakenly call it “desiccation.” Consumers eating products made from wheat flour are undoubtedly consuming minute amounts of Roundup. An interesting aside, malt barley which is made into beer is not acceptable in the marketplace if it has been sprayed with preharvest Roundup. Lentils and peas are not accepted in the market place if it was sprayed with preharvest roundup….. but wheat is ok.. This farming practice greatly concerns me and it should further concern consumers of wheat products.Here’s what wheat farmer Seth Woodland of Woodland and Wheat in Idaho had to say about the practice of using herbicides for wheat dry down:That practice is bad . I have fellow farmers around me that do it and it is sad. Lucky for you not all of us farm that way. Being the farmer and also the president of a business, we are proud to say that we do not use round up on our wheat ever!This practice is not just widespread in the United States either. The Food Standards Agency in the United Kingdom reports that use of Roundup as a wheat desiccant results in glyphosate residues regularly showing up in bread samples. Other European countries are waking up to to the danger, however. In the Netherlands, use of Roundup is completely banned with France likely soon to follow.Using Roundup on wheat crops throughout the entire growing season and even as a desiccant just prior to harvest may save the farmer money and increase profits, but it is devastating to the health of the consumer who ultimately consumes the glyphosate residue laden wheat kernels.The chart below of skyrocketing applications of glyphosate to US wheat crops since 1990 and the incidence of celiac disease is from a December 2013 study published in the Journal Interdisciplinary Toxicology examining glyphosate pathways to autoimmune disease. Remember that wheat is not currently GMO or “Roundup Ready” meaning it is not resistant to its withering effects like GMO corn or GMO soy, so application of glyphosate to wheat would actually kill it.While the herbicide industry maintains that glyphosate is minimally toxic to humans,  research published in the Journal Entropy  strongly argues otherwise by shedding light on exactly how glyphosate disrupts mammalian physiology.Authored by Anthony Samsel and Stephanie Seneff of MIT, the paper investigates glyphosate’s inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, an overlooked component of lethal toxicity to mammals.The currently accepted view is that ghyphosate is not harmful to humans or any mammals.  This flawed view is so pervasive in the conventional farming community that Roundup salesmen have been known to foolishly drink it during presentations!However, just because Roundup doesn’t kill you immediately doesn’t make it nontoxic.  In fact, the active ingredient in Roundup lethally disrupts the all important shikimate pathway found in beneficial gut microbes which is responsible for synthesis of critical amino acids.Friendly gut bacteria, also called probiotics, play a critical role in human health. Gut bacteria aid digestion, prevent permeability of the gastointestinal tract (which discourages the development of autoimmune disease), synthesize vitamins and provide the foundation for robust immunity.  In essence:Roundup significantly disrupts the functioning of beneficial bacteria in the gut and contributes to permeability of the intestinal wall and consequent expression of autoimmune disease symptoms.In synergy with disruption of the biosynthesis of important amino acids via the shikimate pathway, glyphosate inhibits the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes produced by the gut microbiome.  CYP enzymes are critical to human biology because they detoxify the multitude of foreign chemical compounds, xenobiotics, that we are exposed to in our modern environment today.As a result, humans exposed to glyphosate through use of Roundup in their community or through ingestion of its residues on industrialized food products become even more vulnerable to the damaging effects of other chemicals and environmental toxins they encounter!What’s worse is that the negative impact of glyphosate exposure is slow and insidious over months and years as inflammation gradually gains a foothold in the cellular systems of the body.The consequences of this systemic inflammation are most of the diseases and conditions associated with the Western lifestyle:Gastrointestinal disorders	1

Several of the diplomats were recent arrivals at the embassy, which reopened in 2015 as part of former President Barack Obama's reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba.Some of the diplomats' symptoms were so severe that they were forced to cancel their tours early and return to the United States, officials said. After months of investigation, U.S. officials concluded that the diplomats had been exposed to an advanced device that operated outside the range of audible sound and had been deployed either inside or outside their residences. It was not immediately clear if the device was a weapon used in a deliberate attack, or had some other purpose.The U.S. officials weren't authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the U.S. retaliated by expelling two Cuban diplomats from their embassy in Washington on May 23. She did not say how many U.S. diplomats were affected or confirm they had suffered hearing loss, saying only that they had ""a variety of physical symptoms.""The Cuban government said in a lengthy statement late Wednesday that ""Cuba has never permitted, nor will permit, that Cuban territory be used for any action against accredited diplomatic officials or their families, with no exception.""The statement from the Cuban Foreign Ministry said it had been informed of the incidents on Feb. 17 and had launched an ""exhaustive, high-priority, urgent investigation at the behest of the highest level of the Cuban government.""It said the decision to expel two Cuban diplomats was ""unjustified and baseless.""The ministry said it had created an expert committee to analyze the incidents and had reinforced security around the U.S. embassy and U.S. diplomatic residences.""Cuba is universally considered a safe destination for visitors and foreign diplomats, including U.S. citizens,"" the statement said.U.S. officials told The Associated Press that about five diplomats, several with spouses, had been affected and that no children had been involved. The FBI and Diplomatic Security Service are investigating.Cuba employs a state security apparatus that keeps many people under surveillance and U.S. diplomats are among the most closely monitored people on the island. Like virtually all foreign diplomats in Cuba, the victims of the incidents lived in housing owned and maintained by the Cuban government.However, officials familiar with the probe said investigators were looking into the possibilities that the incidents were carried out by a third country such as Russia, possibly operating without the knowledge of Cuba's formal chain of command.Nauert said investigators did not yet have a definitive explanation for the incidents but stressed they take them ""very seriously,"" as shown by the Cuban diplomats' expulsions.""We requested their departure as a reciprocal measure since some U.S. personnel's assignments in Havana had to be curtailed due to these incidents,"" she said. ""Under the Vienna Convention, Cuba has an obligation to take measures to protect diplomats.""U.S. diplomats in Cuba said they suffered occasional harassment for years after the restoration of limited ties with the communist government in the 1970s, harassment reciprocated by U.S. agents against Cuban diplomats in Washington.

These attempts to distort Catholic teaching have weakened the Church’s witness to the truths of the natural and supernatural order and have threatened the well-being of the family, especially its weakest and most vulnerable members.The Apostolic Exhortation Amoris Laetitia is a very lengthy document, which discusses a wide variety of subjects related to the family. There are many passages that faithfully reflect Catholic teaching but this cannot, and does not, lessen the gravity of those passages which undermine the teaching and practice of the Catholic Church. Voice of the Family intends to present full analyses of the serious problems in the text over the coming days and weeks.Voice of the Family expresses the following initial concerns with the greatest reverence for the papal office and solely out of a sincere desire to assist the hierarchy in its proclamation of Catholic teaching on life, marriage and the family and to further the authentic good of the family and its most vulnerable members.We consider that in raising the following concerns we fulfil our duty as clearly laid out in the Code of Canon Law, which states:According to the knowledge, competence, and prestige which they possess, they have the right and even at times the duty to manifest to the sacred pastors their opinion on matters which pertain to the good of the Church and to make their opinion known to the rest of the Christian faithful, without prejudice to the integrity of faith and morals, with reverence toward their pastors, and attentive to common advantage and the dignity of persons. ( Canon 212 §3 )Admission of the “divorced and remarried” to Holy CommunionAmoris Laetitia, over the course of Chapter VIII (paragraphs 291-312), proposes a number of approaches that prepare the way for “divorced and remarried” Catholics to receive Holy Communion without true repentance and amendment of life. These paragraphs include:confused expositions of Catholic teaching on the nature and effects of mortal sin, on the imputability of sin, and on the nature of conscience;the use of ideological language in place of the Church’s traditional terminology;and the use of selective and misleading quotations from previous Church documents.A particularly troubling example of misquotation of previous teaching is found in paragraph 298 which quotes the statement of Pope John Paul II, made in Familiaris Consortio, that there exist situations “where, for serious reasons, such as the children’s upbringing, a man and woman cannot satisfy the obligation to separate.” However in Amoris Laetitia the second half of Pope John Paul II’s sentence, which states that such couples “take on themselves the duty to live in complete continence, that is, by abstinence from the acts proper to married couples” (Familiaris Consortio, No. 84),  is omitted.Furthermore, in the footnote to this misleading quotation, we read:In such situations, many people, knowing and accepting the possibility of living ‘as brothers and sisters’ which the Church offers them, point out that if certain expressions of intimacy are lacking, ‘it often happens that faithfulness is endangered and the good of the children suffers’ (Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World Gaudium et Spes, 51).The document makes reference to this erroneous view but does not explain why it is a false approach, which is namely that: All sexual acts outside of a valid marriage are intrinsically evil and it is never justifiable to commit an intrinsically evil act, even in order to achieve a good end.“Faithfulness is endangered” by acts of sexual intimacy outside of marriage but faithfulness is lived when two individuals in an invalid union refrain from sexual intimacy in fidelity to their original union, which remains valid.The quotation implies that children will suffer because their parents, with the help of divine grace, live chastely. On the contrary, such parents are giving their children an example of fidelity, chastity and trust in the power of God’s grace.The document cites Gaudium et Spes but the passage is quoted out of context and does not support the argument made. The context makes clear that Gaudium et Spes is speaking of married Catholics, in the context of procreation, not those cohabiting in an invalid union. The full sentence is as follows:But where the intimacy of married life is broken off, its faithfulness can sometimes be imperilled and its quality of fruitfulness ruined, for then the upbringing of the children and the courage to accept new ones are both endangered (Gaudium et Spes, No. 51).It is therefore difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Apostolic Exhortation is at least raising the possibility that adulterous sexual acts might in some cases be justifiable and has misquoted Gaudium et Spes as if to provide grounds for this.Other approaches that undermine Catholic doctrine on reception of the sacraments will be discussed by Voice of the Family in due course.Parental rights and sex educationAmoris Laetitia includes a section entitled “The Need for Sex Education” (paragraphs 280-286). This section spans more than five pages without making even one reference to parents. On the other hand there is reference to “educational institutions”. Yet sex education is “a basic right and duty of parents” which “must always be carried out under their attentive guidance, whether at home or in educational centers chosen and controlled by them” (Pope John Paul II, Familiaris Consortio, No. 37). The omission of this teaching seriously fails parents at a time when parental rights regarding sex education are under serious and sustained attack in many nations of the world, and at the international institutions. In this section Amoris Laetitia does not cite any of the previous Church documents that clearly affirm this right; it does however cite a psychoanalyst, Erich Fromm, associated with the Frankfurt school. The document’s earlier references to parental rights (paragraph 84), while welcome, cannot compensate for the exclusion of parents from this section.Homosexual unionsAmoris Laetitia, following an approach similar to that previously adopted in synod documents, implies that “same-sex unions” may offer a “certain stability” and can have a kind of similarity or relation to marriage. It states that:We need to acknowledge the great variety of family situations that can offer a certain stability, but de facto or same-sex unions, for example, may not simply be equated with marriage. (Paragraph 53)There is great pressure at the international institutions for the rejection of the traditional understanding of the family through the adoption of language which refers to “variety” or “diversity” in the forms of the family. The implication that “same-sex unions” form part of the “great variety of family situations” is precisely what pro-family groups are fighting hard to oppose. By using such language the Apostolic Exhortation undermines the pro-family movement’s work to protect the true definition of the family and, consequently, to protect children who depend on the family structure willed by God for their well-being and healthy development.It should be noted that in paragraph 251 the authentic teaching of the Church, that “there are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to God’s plan for marriage and family” is restated.“Gender ideology”Amoris Laetitia endorses a central aspect of “gender ideology” by asserting that it “needs to be emphasized” that biological sex and socio-cultural ‘gender’ can be “distinguished but not separated” (paragraph 56). This acceptance of the underlying principle of gender theory undermines the document’s otherwise welcome criticism of the ideology and its effects. The false notion that biological sex is distinguishable from so-called “gender” was first proposed in the 1950s and is the foundation of “gender ideology”. Opposition to the consequences of “gender ideology”will be impossible if its erroneous first principle is accepted.Attacks on innocent human lifeAmoris Laetitia fails to grapple with the scale of the threat to unborn children, the elderly and the disabled. Conservative estimates indicate that over one billion unborn lives have been destroyed by abortion over the last century. Yet in a document addressing challenges to the family, which is 264 pages long, there are only a small number of passing references to abortion. There is no mention of the destruction caused by artificial methods of reproduction, which have also resulted in the loss of millions of human lives. The absence of serious discussion of attacks on unborn life in this context is a grave omission.There is also minimal reference to euthanasia and assisted suicide despite the increasing pressure for their legalization across the world. Failure to adequately discuss this threat is likewise another very regrettable omission.ContraceptionAmoris Laetitia fails to adequately restate Catholic teaching on the use of contraception. This is a troubling oversight given that (i) the separation of the procreative and unitive ends of the sexual act is a major catalyst for the culture of death and that (ii) there is widespread disobedience and ignorance of the Church’s teaching in this area precisely because of the failure of the hierarchy to communicate this truth.  The document’s discussion of conscience is likewise flawed both in paragraph 222, which deals with “responsible parenthood”, and in Chapter VIII which deals with the admission to the sacraments of those in public adultery. Paragraph 303 is of particular concern, especially in the following assertion:Yet conscience can do more than recognize that a given situation does not correspond objectively to the overall demands of the Gospel. It can also recognize with sincerity and honesty what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God, and come to see with a certain moral security that it is what God himself is asking amid the concrete complexity of one’s limits, while yet not fully the objective ideal. In any event, let us recall that this discernment is dynamic; it must remain ever open to new stages of growth and to new decisions which can enable the ideal to be more fully realized.This statement seems to adopt a false understanding of the “law of gradualness” and suggest that there are certain occasions when sin is not only unavoidable but even actively willed by God for that person. This would clearly be unacceptable.ConclusionsThis is only a brief introduction to the very numerous problems found within Amoris Laetitia. It will take further study to fully draw out all the implications of the text but it is already abundantly clear that the document fails to give a clear and faithful exposition of Catholic doctrine and leads inescapably to conclusions that could result in violations of the immutable teaching of the Catholic Church, and those disciplines which are inextricably founded upon it. Our initial overview provides sufficient cause to regard this document as a threat to the integrity of the Catholic faith and the authentic good of the family.We reiterate once again that we make these criticisms with great reverence for the office of the papacy but with the consciousness of our duties as lay Catholics towards the good of the Church, and our duties as pro-life/pro-family campaigners to work to protect the family and its most vulnerable members.	1

The disease was unknown in Europe or any other continent, occurring only in North America.White snakeroot is a shade-loving plant found throughout Indiana. It is commonly seen growing on roadsides, in damp open areas, or on the shaded north side of ridges. The plant is also found in western Ohio and the wooded parts of Illinois. These three states probably had the greatest quantity of the weed and probably do so today.By definition, milk sickness is poisoning by milk from cows that have  eaten white snakeroot. Many early settlers in the Midwest came into contact with the sickness. In the fall of 1818, Nancy Hanks Lincoln died as milk sickness struck the Little Pigeon Creek settlement.The sickness has been called puking fever, sick stomach, the slows, and the trembles. The illness was most common in dry years when cows wandered from poor pastures to the woods in search of food. In man, the symptoms are loss of appetite, listlessness, weakness, vague pains, muscle stiffness, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, severe constipation, bad breath, and finally coma. Recovery is slow and may never be complete, but more often an attack is fatal, as it was for Nancy Hanks Lincoln. She died on October 5, 1818.While milk sickness usually develops when a person or animal eats the plant, the sickness can also occur if one eats heavily of the flesh of an animal that has died of severe white snakeroot poisoning. Within the present century persons have suffered and died from milk sickness in parts of Indiana, Ohio, and Illinois. It is written that more than half of the deaths that occurred early in the 19th century in Dubois County, Indiana, were caused by milk sickness.In the library of the Surgeon General in Washington, D.C. are some 200 articles pertaining to milk sickness, many of them in medical journals. Until the present century, few people -- including physicians -- knew much of the sickness. Milk sickness or ""trembles"" was more prevalent in late summer and early fall, but records show that many cases occurred in the winter and early summer also. In late summer, when the plant is in full bloom, it is easily recognized, growing to a height of 18 to 48 inches, more woodlands were cleared, cattle had adequate pasture even in dry weather. As a result the incidence of the disease tapered off. The mixing of milk from many cows at the dairy further reduces the chances of milk sickness today.EXPERIENCE YOUR AMERICA""The National Park Service cares for special places saved by the American        people so that all may experience our heritage.""  "	0

It has recently come to the attention of the College that one of the recommended vaccines could possibly be associated with the very rare but serious condition of premature ovarian failure (POF), also known as premature menopause. There have been two case report series (3 cases each) published since 2013 in which post-menarcheal adolescent girls developed laboratory documented POF within weeks to several years of receiving Gardasil, a four-strain human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV4).1,2 Adverse events that occur after vaccines are frequently not caused by the vaccine and there has not been a noticeable rise in POF cases in the last 9 years since HPV4 vaccine has been widely used.Nevertheless there are legitimate concerns that should be addressed: (1) long-term ovarian function was not assessed in either the original rat safety studies3,4 or in the human vaccine trials, (2) most primary care physicians are probably unaware of a possible association between HPV4 and POF and may not consider reporting POF cases or prolonged amenorrhea (missing menstrual periods) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), (3) potential mechanisms of action have been postulated based on autoimmune associations with the aluminum adjuvant used1 and previously documented ovarian toxicity in rats from another component, polysorbate 80,2 and (4) since licensure of Gardasil® in 2006, there have been about 213 VAERS reports (per the publicly available CDC WONDER VAERS database) involving amenorrhea, POF or premature menopause, 88% of which have been associated with Gardasil®.5 The two-strain HPV2, CervarixTM, was licensed late in 2009 and accounts for 4.7 % of VAERS amenorrhea reports since 2006, and 8.5% of those reports from February 2010 through May 2015. This compares to the pre-HPV vaccine period from 1990 to 2006 during which no cases of POF or premature menopause and 32 cases of amenorrhea were reported to VAERS.Many adolescent females are vaccinated with influenza, meningococcal, and tetanus vaccines without getting Gardasil®, and yet only 5.6% of reports related to ovarian dysfunction since 2006 are associated with such vaccines in the absence of simultaneous Gardasil® administration. The overwhelming majority (76%) of VAERS reports since 2006 with ovarian failure, premature menopause, and/or amenorrhea are associated solely with Gardasil®. When VAERS reports since 2006 are restricted to cases in which amenorrhea occurred for at least 4 months and is not associated with other known causes like polycystic ovary syndrome or pregnancy, 86/89 cases are associated with Gardasil®, 3/89 with CervarixTM, and 0/89 with other vaccines administered independently of an HPV vaccine.5 Using the same criteria, there are only 7 reports of amenorrhea from 1990 through 2005 and no more than 2 of those associated with any one vaccine type.Few other vaccines besides Gardasil® that are administered in adolescence contain polysorbate 80.6 Pre-licensure safety trials for Gardasil® used placebo that contained polysorbate 80 as well as aluminum adjuvant.2,7 Therefore, if such ingredients could cause ovarian dysfunction, an increase in amenorrhea probably would not have been detected in the placebo controlled trials. Furthermore, a large number of girls in the original trials were taking hormonal contraceptives which can mask ovarian dysfunction including amenorrhea and ovarian failure.2 Thus a causal relationship between human papillomavirus vaccines (if not Gardasil® specifically) and ovarian dysfunction cannot be ruled out at this time.Numerous Gardasil safety studies, including one released recently,8 have looked at demyelinating and autoimmune diseases and have not found any significant problems. Unfortunately, none of them except clinical safety pre-licensure studies totaling 11,778 vaccinees9 specifically addressed post-vaccination ovarian dysfunction. While data from those studies do not indicate an increased rate of amenorrhea after vaccination, the essential lack of saline placebos and the majority of participants taking hormonal contraceptives in those studies preclude meaningful data to rule out an effect on ovarian function.A Vaccine Safety Datalink POF study is planned to address an association between these vaccines and POF, but it may be years before results will be determined. Plus, POF within a few years of vaccination could be the tip of the iceberg since ovarian dysfunction manifested by months of amenorrhea may later progress to POF. Meanwhile, the author of this statement has contacted the maker of Gardasil, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to make known the above concerns and request that (1) more rat studies be done to look at long-term ovarian function after HPV4 injections, (2) the 89 VAERS reports identified with at least 4 months amenorrhea be reviewed by the CDC for further clarification since the publicly available WONDER VAERS database only contains initial reports, and (3) primary care providers be notified of a possible association between HPV and amenorrhea. A U.S. Government Representative responded that they “will continue to conduct studies and monitor the safety of HPV vaccines. Should the weight of the evidence from VAERS or VSD and other sources indicate a likely causal association between POF and HPV vaccines, appropriate action will be taken in terms of communication and public health response.”The College is posting this statement so that individuals considering the use of human papillomavirus vaccines could be made aware of these concerns pending further action by the regulatory agencies and manufacturers. While there is no strong evidence of a causal relationship between HPV4 and ovarian dysfunction, this information should be public knowledge for physicians and patients considering these vaccines.Primary author: Scott S.

https://www.snopes.com/texas-harvey-israel/	Did a City in Texas Require Harvey Aid Recipients to Promise Not to Boycott Israel?	true	['harvey', ' hurricane harvey', ' israel', ' israel boycott', ' texas']	https://www.texasmonthly.com/	https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/dickinson-harvey-israel/	2017/10/24	8 CommentsQUOTE OF THE DAY“We understand your desire to attend our games as an escape and chosen form of entertainment. In that, we feel there is significant commonality in all of us that allows our community to be so special. That commonality should include aspirations for social justice, freedom of speech in its many forms, and equal opportunity for education and economic advancement regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or religion.”—Manu Ginobili, in a tweet on Thursday, according to the San Antonio Express-News . Before Wednesday’s game, Spurs players—along with retired legends Tim Duncan and David Robinson—locked arms as the above message was displayed on screens inside the AT&T Center.BIG NEWSChris Gaspard helps remove ruined items from his friend Bryan Parson’s home brought on by flooding in the wake of Hurricane Harvey in Dickinson, Texas.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty ImagesBad DealThe city of Dickinson, in Galveston County, was among the hardest-hit places when Hurricane Harvey’s torrential rains slammed Texas . Residents now seeking Harvey relief face a strange ultimatum: agree not to boycott Israel, or your application for aid will be denied. According to the Houston Chronicle , the city’s hurricane repair grant application , which allows residents to apply for funds to help rebuild a home or business impacted by Hurricane Harvey, includes a surprising stipulation. “By executing this Agreement below, the Applicant verifies that the Applicant: (1) does not boycott Israel; and (2) will not boycott Israel during the term of this Agreement,” it states. The application has gotten the attention of the American Civil Liberties Union, which called the prohibition unconstitutional on Thursday. “The First Amendment protects Americans’ right to boycott, and the government cannot condition hurricane relief or any other public benefit on a commitment to refrain from protected political expression,” Andre Segura, the legal director of the ACLU of Texas, told the Chronicle. “Dickinson’s requirement is an egregious violation of the First Amendment, reminiscent of McCarthy-era loyalty oaths requiring Americans to disavow membership in the Communist party and other forms of ‘subversive’ activity.”MEANWHILE, IN TEXASReal TalkFormer President George W. Bush delivered a harshly worded speech on Thursday. He condemned the divisive actions of President Donald Trump , though he stopped short of actually calling out the president by name. “We’ve seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty,” Bush said during a sixteen-minute address at “The Spirit of Liberty” event in New York, sponsored by his presidential center. “Bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone and provides permission for cruelty and bigotry. The only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to them.” Bush said our political system has been corrupted by “conspiracy theories and outright fabrication,” and cautioned against the U.S. turning inward under Trump. “We’ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism, forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America,” Bush said. “We see a fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade, forgetting that conflict, instability and poverty follow in the wake of protectionism. We’ve seen the return of isolationist sentiments, forgetting that American security is directly threatened by the chaos and despair of distant places.” He took aim at white supremacy too. “Our identity as a nation—unlike many other nations—is not determined by geography or ethnicity, by soil or blood,” Bush said. “This means that people of every race, religion, and ethnicity can be fully and equally American. It means that bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed.”On the BrinkThe Houston Astros face a must-win situation Friday night in game six of the American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees. If they win, they live another day, forcing a series-deciding game seven in Houston on Saturday. If they lose, their season is done. As ESPN notes, this is an unusual spot for the ‘Stros to be in. They’ve held onto first place in the American League West for 178 of 183 days during the regular season, every day since April 12, and they held a lead at the end of 25 of 36 innings in the previous round of the playoffs. Even in the ALCS, they were leading or tied through the series’s first nineteen innings, jumping out to a 2-0 series lead. On Friday, the team will turn to starting pitcher Justin Verlander, who dominated the Yankees in the second game of the series, striking out thirteen batters while allowing one run over nine spectacular innings. They’ll also have the support of their home crowd. “Our backs are against the wall,” catcher Brian McCann told ESPN. “We’ll be ready. This team, we’ve played extremely well all season long, and nothing’s going to change. We’ll be ready for game six. We’ve responded all year long.”Fast Food BeefWhataburger is typically considered the undisputed champ of the fast food scene here in Texas, but according to a new ranking by Business Insider , Texans actually prefer California-based chain In-N-Out. Yes, we know, this is truly a travesty. Business Insider’s methodology here is hardly scientific, as it relies solely the publication data from Foursquare, a social media app which lets users “check in” at certain locations, to determine which fast food restaurant was most popular in each state. “For the study, we looked at which chains received the most visits on average in every state based on the total number of visits to each chain divided by the number of locations in that state,” Business Insider wrote. Somehow, that research showed In-N-Out as the top choice among Texans. As the Houston Chronicle notes, In-N-Out only has 35 restaurants in Texas, while Whataburger has nearly 200 locations in the Houston area alone. We think Whataburger still has a leg up on In-N-Out, regardless of what Business Insider says.WHAT WE’RE READINGSome links are paywalled or subscription-only.Laura Bush will appear as a guest in the final season of Fixer Upper  Dallas Morning NewsAustin’s Richard Overton, the oldest living World War II veteran in the U.S., has new digs Austin American-StatesmanA Killeen ISD teacher duct-taped the mouths of ten fifth-graders Killeen Daily HeraldAmazon just opened a giant wind farm in Scurry County CNBCThe death of a pet dog gave a Texan woman “broken-heart syndrome” Washington PostGet Texas Monthly.

It’s why he calls his lab manager, Wade Sanders, “Walter,” after the show’s protagonist, Walter White.And like the famously pure and powerful blue meth White cooked up on Breaking Bad, the product produced by 710 Labs’ fancy equipment is extremely concentrated, powerful, and coveted: butane-extracted hash oil (BHO). The lab’s finished BHO might not look like much—a thin, hard, and shiny brown slab, like peanut brittle without the peanuts—but when a piece of this “shatter,” as it’s called, is placed on the nail of a specially designed pipe that’s been superheated by a blowtorch, it vaporizes and delivers a direct hit of 70 to 90 percent THC, three times the potency of the strongest marijuana strains. As Melshenker puts it, if smoking regular pot is like drinking a beer, “dabbing,” as this process is known, is a shot of hard liquor. Vice calls the result , “The smoothest slow-motion smack in the face of clean, serene stonedness that you’ve ever experienced.” Rolling Stone reports , “Your head spins, your eyes get fluttery, a few beads of sweat surface on your forehead and, suddenly, you're cosmically baked.” Some pot aficionados vow to never smoke the old way again.Gucci Earwax, a butane extraction, made by Mahatma Extreme Concentrates for Karmaceuticals in Denver. It won the first-place medical concentrate trophy at the High Times 2013 Denver U.S. Cannabis Cup.Courtesy of Ry Prichard/CannabisEncyclopedia.comHash, in other words, is no longer just a way to make use of leftover marijuana trim. It’s now becoming the main attraction. (Butane isn’t the only way to extract hash oil from marijuana, either; some concentrate-makers use carbon dioxide– or water-based extraction methods.) At Greenest Green , Melshenker’s Boulder dispensary, the inventory used to be 60 percent marijuana flower, 30 percent BHO, and 10 percent edibles. Now it’s the opposite: 60 percent BHO, 30 percent flower, and 10 percent edibles. And roughly 40 dispensaries statewide contract with 710 Labs to turn their marijuana into shatter or “budder,” a gloopier version. (Because of delays in Boulder’s regulation process, 710 Labs won’t be able to produce recreational BHO until Feb. 17.)AdvertisementHash oil is even fueling its own subculture. Forget 4:20; “dab heads” or “oil kids” light up at 7:10. (Turn the digits upside down and you have “OIL.”) Connoisseurs sport specially designed blowtorches and incredibly pricey “oil rig” pipes; a top-of-the-line rig from Melshenker’s Faulty Pelican glass company sets you back $14,000. There’s even dab gear, made by companies like Grassroots .“There’s a whole industry here,” says Melshenker, whose business card doubles as a stainless-steel dabber, the tool used to apply BHO to an oil rig’s superheated nail.A production process laden with volatile chemicals; a highly concentrated, easily transportable final product; incredibly stoned kids with blowtorches …Colorado’s thriving dabbing scene could just be one more bit of proof that the state is becoming a global mecca for marijuana. After all, the state’s legalized marijuana experiment has so far been an unqualified success. Despite the surprisingly limited number of recreational pot shops that opened their doors on Jan. 1—and the hefty crowds waiting in line to patronize them—the state hasn’t experienced widespread product shortages or weed prices high enough to trigger an Uber-style backlash . Yes, there was that story about 37 deadly marijuana overdoses on the first day of sales , but it turned out to be an obvious hoax. The few pundits who’ve complained about Colorado’s legalized pot, like David Brooks and Nancy Grace, have found their arguments blasted full of holes , not to mention lambasted on Saturday Night Live . The Justice Department is looking into ways to help banks play nice with marijuana businesses — a very serious problem —and even President Obama in a recent New Yorker profile conceded it’s important for the experiment to go forward .Soon enough, then, Colorado’s small-scale experiment should spread far and wide, with controversial drug laws getting the boot, millions of clandestine tokers coming out of the closet, and governments reaping the benefits in taxes and fees. That is unless something goes terribly wrong, derailing the whole legalization movement.AdvertisementSuch a gloomy outcome isn’t out of the question. The only reason that Colorado is enjoying fame as the first place to legalize pot is thanks to a combination of fortunate timing, plucky advocates, forward-thinking lawmakers, and a remarkable lack of snafus. Colorado’s 2012 legalization attempt very well could have floundered if the effort hadn’t enjoyed remarkably positive media coverage. Considering the precipitous rise of the state’s medical marijuana industry and lawmakers’ keen efforts to moderate it, all it could have taken was the right bad headline—a high-profile crime or a boneheaded political move—to set the endeavor back considerably. Recall that alcohol prohibition was built on the temperance movement’s carefully crafted tales of woe and violence. As Salvation Army Commander Evangeline Booth once put it :Drink has drained more blood …Dishonored more womanhood,Blasted more lives,Driven more to suicide, andDug more graves than any other poisoned scourge that ever swept its death-dealing waves across the world.Mixed shatter slab by TC Labs. The product is broken prior to packaging to fit into the 1 gram or less packaging requirements.Courtesy of Ry Prichard/CannabisEncyclopedia.comIn Colorado, however, there have been very few sordid marijuana tales that could be used to demonize the drug—so far. Weed-fueled horror stories could still emerge in the state—and with the world watching, such calamities could have an international impact. So what are the biggest potential risks? A major concern is diversion, taking Colorado’s legal pot and offloading it to the black market or selling it out of state. While Colorado has established an extensive tracking system to prevent this from happening, there will always be tourists trying to take home a pot-infused souvenir. Beyond diversion, there’s the menace of crime—not just the threat of burglaries and organized crime in a largely cash-based industry, but also the distant possibility of banks or other financial institutions getting slapped with federal money laundering charges if they accept any of that free-flowing marijuana cash. Finally, there’s the prospective collateral damage, such as kids accidentally eating pot brownies— something that’s already in the news —or a violent pot-related car crash.If any of these calamities do occur, Colorado’s red-hot dabbing scene could in fact be the source of the problem. Dabbing certainly appears on the surface to be dangerous: Kids are freebasing marijuana! It looks like they’re smoking crack! But it’s important to remember that there’s no evidence that it’s possible to overdose on pot. (Compared to say, acetaminophen, overdoses of which killed more than 1,500 Americans during the past decade.) So you can smoke the strongest dab imaginable—or even, if you’re a showboat, smoke 50 dabs in a row —and science says it won’t kill you. It will just get you really, really high.Mars OG ISO dab, an isopropyl alcohol extraction made by Pink House Labs in Denver.Courtesy of Ry Prichard/CannabisEncyclopedia.comAdvertisementBut just because something won’t poison you the way alcohol can doesn’t mean it can’t lead you to do something stupid enough that will kill you. And there seem to be enough disconcerting variables associated with dabbing culture—a production process laden with volatile chemicals; a highly concentrated, easily transportable final product; and incredibly stoned kids with blowtorches—it seems only a matter of time until somebody in the scene does something very stupid and possibly fatal.Yes, dabbing might not be as inherently dangerous as, say, a bar full of binge-drinkers. But it’s important to remember that recreational marijuana isn’t necessarily replacing alcohol use—it’s just adding a new legal vice to the options people already have. While some researchers predict legalized marijuana will decrease alcohol use , others predict it could lead to “heavy drinking” and “carnage on our highways.” So will folks really reach for a dabbing pipe instead of a shot glass—or will they reach for both?Top CommentNobody tell these fellows about vaporizers. They're going to worry about them detonating the atmosphere, or causing glaciers to melt, or something.   More...-J P McMahonJoin InQuestions like this have led California and Washington to outlaw the production of smokeable marijuana concentrates. Colorado, however, has gone the opposite route: In November it released a draft of proposed concentrate production rules , positioning itself to become the only place in the world where marijuana concentrate production is both legal and regulated. The idea is to police the blooming subculture, to stay on top of it, so it ends up more akin to tattooing than meth. “If we outlaw concentrates, people will make them in their basements and blow themselves up,” says Norton Arbelaez, co-owner of the Denver dispensary RiverRock Wellness , which operates a concentrate production facility. But just because a concentrate extraction system is certified by a third-party industrial hygienist, as will likely be required by Colorado’s concentrate rules, doesn’t mean that system can’t still accidentally blow up.It makes sense that Colorado is at the vanguard of legalized dabbing. It’s made a habit of taking risks when it comes to marijuana. Colorado can’t regulate away the chance that dabbing or some other marijuana-related endeavor will lead to a spectacular accident, either industrial or personal. But so far its legalization effort has taken pains to thoughtfully minimize such risks—and so far, it’s working.	1

Center for Biological DiversityThis story was updated at 6:33 p.m. EST.Looking for some Trump wine for the holiday?Head no farther than Shenandoah National Park, where you can pick it up at the Skyland Resort.That's according to Bill Snape, senior counsel at the Center for Biological Diversity, who wants to get to the bottom of why it's sold there.""Even as we sit down for Thanksgiving dinner on Thursday, Trump wine is everywhere — how?"" Snape said in an interview today.AdvertisementHoping to find answers, Snape filed a request under the federal Freedom of Information Act, asking the National Park Service to provide records regarding the sale of wine and other alcoholic beverages at Shenandoah and other national parks.The request also asks NPS to produce any records or documents that mention Trump, his family members or Trump merchandise.Snape said the discovery of the wine at Shenandoah was first made by one of the center's members, who took photos of the bottles but wants to remain anonymous.""She just stumbled across it and obviously got a little fired up and upset. I checked it out and confirmed it,"" Snape said.Snape added that the issue raises more questions on the extent to which Trump's role as commander in chief collides with his role ""as chief of the Trump empire ... with no understanding of where it begins and where it ends.""""If this is the level of Trumpism at national parks, what other policy issues have that level of Trumpism?"" Snape said. ""It just raises a number of disturbing and intriguing conflict-of-interest issues.""Jeremy Barnum, spokesman for the National Park Service, said the wine is not being sold by Shenandoah National Park, but rather by Delaware North Cos. Inc., the park's licensed concessioner.""The National Park Service authorizes concessioners to sell categories of retail goods and products like t-shirts, baseball hats, and in this case wine. However, the NPS does not specify what brands of these products should be sold,"" Barnum said. ""The concessioner has been selling wine from the distributor of this particular winery in Virginia for years."""	1

I have been in ministry for 13 years. 2) I most identify with the Apostle Paul. I was completely against Jesus at one point in my life, even making fun of His followers.  When Jesus saved me by His grace, I became a person who cannot remain silent about His great love. 3) There are so many things that make Greenwell Springs awesome. The music, the preaching, the activities, and the food are all incredible. However, from my very first day walking into Greenwell Springs, the love and fellowship from the people has been amazing.  My favorite aspect would have to be just being in fellowship with the believers here. 4) The best thing about my area of ministry with students has to be the opportunity I am given to teach the Bible. The students of our day are attacked daily with teachings and culture that go against the Word of God. In return our students are not sure what they believe, and they have so many questions. I am blessed to have a chance to help them find the answers that always lead to God. 5) Sulley from Monsters Inc. always makes me think of myself.  Looks tough on the outside but on the inside he is a softy. 6) I love to travel and I have been many places in the world. So far the main place that I would love to visit again is Hawaii. It was so beautiful there. 7) If I’m not at Greenwell Springs during the day I am mostly likely at a school somewhere hanging out with the students. In the evenings I spend a lot of time either with my family or at the gym training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. 	0
https://www.snopes.com/hillary-bill-clinton-russia-sanctions-speech/	Did Hillary Clinton Side With Kremlin on Sanctions Due to a $500,000 Payment to Bill?	unproven	['dnc hack', ' donald trump', ' fox news', ' hillary clinton', ' magnitsky act', ' russia investigation', ' sanctions', ' sergei magnitsky', ' wikileaks']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/hRd2u	2017/07/20	Now PlayingEmails show Bill Clinton paid thousands for speech in RussiaThe Russian lawyer who landed a meeting with Donald Trump Jr. during last year’s presidential campaign with the promise of dirt on Hillary Clinton had one big thing in common with the Democratic candidate: Both had opposed Russia sanctions targeting human-rights abusers. Further, former Secretary of State Clinton’s initial opposition coincided with a $500,000 speech her husband gave in Moscow – a link her 2016 campaign fought to downplay in the press, according to WikiLeaks-released documents.Trump White House officials now are trying to draw attention to that speech and the Clintons’ ties to Russia in a bid to counter criticism over Trump Jr.’s now-infamous meeting. “If you want to talk about having relationships with Russia, I'd look no further than the Clintons,” Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a briefing last week. “Bill Clinton was paid half a million dollars to give a speech to a Russian bank, personally thanked by President Putin.”“With the help of the research team, we killed a Bloomberg story trying to link HRC’s opposition to the Magnitsky bill a $500,000 speech that WJC gave in Moscow.”- May, 2015 email from Clinton campaign stafferThe former president indeed had received a personal call from then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin expressing his appreciation for the speech. According to Mrs. Clinton’s ethics disclosure form filed while she was secretary of State, Bill Clinton was paid $500,000 by the Russia-based finance company Renaissance Capital for his June 29, 2010, speech in Moscow to its employees and guests attending the company's annual conference. The speech is now coming back to haunt the Clintons, considering the company that cut the check was allegedly tied to the scandal that spurred the Global Magnitsky Act, a bill that imposed sanctions on Russians designated as human-rights abusers and eventually would become law in 2012.Related ImageExpand / CollapseFormer President Bill Clinton with his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton  (AP)This was the same law Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya was lobbying against during her sit-down with Trump Jr. last year. And back in 2010, it would have put the Clintons on her side. Shortly before Bill Clinton’s speech in 2010, when members of Congress pushing the sanctions bill had asked Hillary Clinton to refuse visas to Russian officials implicated under the policy, the State Department denied the request. The Obama administration initially was opposed to the Magnitsky Act because then-President Barack Obama was seeking a “reset” with Russia and did not want to deepen the divide between the two countries.Former President Bill Clinton’s speech to Renaissance just weeks later was all the more curious, considering Renaissance’s Russian investment bank executives would have been banned from the U.S. under the law. Fast-forward to 2015, and the timeline apparently had caught the attention of Bloomberg News. Related ImageExpand / CollapsePortrait of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky held by his mother Nataliya Magnitskaya during 2009 press conference in Moscow.  (The Associated Press)According to a memo from Clinton’s presidential campaign team later published by WikiLeaks , however, the Clinton campaign was able to stop the presses.“With the help of the research team, we killed a Bloomberg story trying to link HRC’s opposition to the Magnitsky bill a $500,000 speech that WJC gave in Moscow,” Jesse Lehrich, on the Rapid Response Communications team for Hillary For America, boasted on May 21, 2015. The Global Magnitsky Act was named for 36-year-old tax attorney Sergei Magnitsky, who died in the custody of the Russian government after accusing the government and organized crime of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from a foreign company, Hermitage Capital Management. Magnitsky, hired by foreign investor and Hermitage owner William Browder, had tracked what turned out to be hundreds of millions of dollars in tax fraud. He reported the fraud to the Russian authorities, but instead of pursuing charges against the alleged offender, Russian authorities jailed Magnitsky.After Magnitsky died in November 2009, Browder said Magnitsky proved Renaissance officials were among those orchestrating the scheme. The State Department finally reversed its position in 2011 and refused visas to some Russians purportedly involved in the financial fraud seeking to enter the country.The Magnitsky Act passed with bipartisan support in 2012.Russia retaliated against the U.S., ending any possibility for Americans to adopt Russian orphans and also banning 18 U.S. officials from entering their country.Malia Zimmerman is an award-winning investigative reporter focusing on crime, homeland security, illegal immigration crime, terrorism and political corruption.

That decision, to play both sides and continue the divisiveness of Barack Obama, has now cost them dearly.Nike, the largest athletic company and number one sponsor of professional sports in the world, has canceled all dealings with the Dallas Cowboys. Company CEO Isaac P. Freely told Fox Sports:“To come out on the field and kneel to thugs and criminals just before saluting the flag was a reprehensible move our company won’t easily forgive. The Dallas Cowboys are no longer licensed to wear, display or sell merchandise with the Nike name or logo on it.”Owner Jerry Jones says he will fight the move, stating that he was showing his players that he was with them but still managed to see that every one of them stood for the National Anthem.Sorry, Jerry, but it isn’t about the National Anthem anymore, it’s about respect. Those people should just take their “protests” to places where they’re welcome.Share This As American As Apple Pie Article Now!11.9k	1

The houses nearby are emptied of the living. The victims symptoms are consistent with sarin, the nerve agent that was dropped on an opposition-held area near Damascus in 2013, killing more than 1,000 people. After that attack the regime supposedly gave up its chemical weapons arsenal.Moscow, Bashar al-Assads principal backer in the war, said the Syrian government had bombed a rebel-run toxic gas manufacturing plant in Khan Sheikhun, and that the gas had subsequently leaked out.

You can look at it ; theres nothing there except maybe some grain and animal dung, and theres even a dead goat there that suffocated in the attack, one person said. Residents responded in disbelief to the Russian allegation.There was no evidence of any building being hit in recent days or weeks near where so many people were killed and wounded by a nerve agent. The homes across the street appeared undamaged from the outside. There was no contamination zone near any building. Instead, the contamination area radiated from a hole in a road.

They offered fresh details that shed light on an incident that has prompted worldwide condemnation and refocused attention on the brutality of the Syrian war. It was like Judgment Day, said Hamid Khutainy, a civil defence volunteer in Khan Sheikhun.Witnesses said the air raids began shortly after 6.30am on Tuesday, with four bombings around the town. Initially they thought it was just another airstrike, until the first responders who arrived at the scene began falling to the ground.Khutainy said: They told us HQ, we are losing control. We had no idea what they were trying to say. Then they said, come save us, we can no longer walk. So the second and third teams went with just face masks. We could smell it from 500 metres away.People described a scene of utter horror at the attack site . The wounded were shaking and convulsing on the ground, foaming at the mouth, their lips blue, passing in and out of consciousness.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Dozens die in suspected chemical attack in Syria  video reportI found children lying on the ground, in their last breaths, their lips going blue, said Abu al-Baraa, who lives nearby and rushed to help when the full extent of what had happened dawned on him. Standing across the street from the crater left by the missile, he added: People on the rooftops and in the basements. People on the ground in the street. Wherever you looked there were dead human beings.Idlib mapThe suffocating patients and those who had died were taken to the nearby civil defence centre and the adjacent clinic built into the side of a rocky mountainous outcrop to withstand potential airstrikes. The dead were laid in a nearby shed while emergency workers hosed down the injured with water, and administered atropine, a nerve agent antidote.But while medical workers were trying to come to grips with the crisis, between eight and 10 airstrikes targeted the medical facility and civil defence centre. The shed collapsed on the dead, and the site was put out of service.Maybe the pilots heard the myth that you could come back to life 48 hours after dying from sarin, so they decided to bomb them again just in case, said an official from the Ahrar al-Sham rebel group who was on the scene. Thank God there is a Day of Judgment in the afterlife.The Guardian visited the destroyed medical facility and civil defence centre briefly. Local people said reconnaissance planes had been spotted in the sky earlier and believed the area might be targeted again later in the day. The site was filled with rubble. Inside, hospital equipment, beds, surgical instruments and small boxes of medicine lay covered in dust or broken on the ground. There were no weapons in sight, and the rooms inside the cave were darkened with the electricity knocked out.Putin stands by Assad as firm evidence of chemical attack mounts Read moreIn a nearby cemetery, the graves were still fresh from funerals the day before, the red soil still upturned. In one corner 18 new graves were set up, the names barely etched with a rough chisel on the tombstones. They contained the bodies of 20 people, including two children who were buried with their mother. They were all from the same family.Abdulhamid al-Yousef, one of the few survivors in the family, was receiving condolences at his home in Khan Sheikhun, a day after burying his wife and nine-month-old twins, Ahmed and Aya, fighting back tears.Yousef had rushed to help the other victims of the attack. He came back instead to find that much of his family had perished, including siblings, nephews and nieces. His wife and children had rushed down to the bomb shelter in their basement, only for the toxic gas to seep into it, which killed them all.That evening at the cemetery, he insisted on carrying his two infants in his arms to bury them himself. Almost in a trance Yousef repeated the childrens names, choking as he did so. Aya and Ahmed, my souls. Yasser and Ahmed, my brothers who had my back.

Introduction""For several months, our nurses have been baffled to find a dead patient in  the same bed every Friday morning"" a spokeswoman for the Pelonomi Hospital  (Free State, South Africa) told reporters. ""There was no apparent cause for  any of the deaths, and extensive checks on the air conditioning system, and a search for possible bacterial infection, failed to reveal any clues.""""However, further inquiries have now revealed the cause of these deaths.  It seems that every Friday morning a cleaner would enter the ward, remove the plug that powered the patient's life support system, plug her floor polisher into the vacant socket, then go about her business. When she had finished her chores, she would plug the life support machine back in and leave, unaware that the patient was now dead. She could not, after all, hear the screams and eventual death rattle over the whirring of her polisher.""We are sorry, and have sent a strong letter to the cleaner in question. Further, the Free State Health and Welfare Department is arranging for an electrician to fit an extra socket, so there should be no repetition of this incident. The enquiry is now closed.""from (Cape Times, 6/13/96)BTW, the headline of the newspaper story was, ""Cleaner Polishes Off Patients.""This is the way the world was introduced, in July 1996, to the story of South Africa's most careless cleaner. There was little reason to disbelieve the tale, as it not only cited a credible source (the Cape Times) and a date of appearance, but also quoted officials confirming the tale quite categorically, even down to the wonderful detail of an electrician fitting an extra socket.Problem one: the story as it appeared throughout the world bore little resemblance to the original Cape Times story, and the original Cape Times story bore little resemblance to the story's first mention in print.Problem two: life support systems not only have battery backups, but include alarm systems to alert staff if anything goes wrong, as well as monitoring equipment that would reveal an interruption in the information flow.2. So what are you saying: this never happened?No; I'm saying that there is no evidence it ever happened. I'm also saying that it is an urban legend, believed by many people around the world, including newspaper editors, who are contributing to its further spread.3. But newspapers require evidence before they report such things, don't they?No; they require a credible source, which is not quite the same thing.4. So what was the source of this story?For most news media that carried it, the Cape Times report was regarded as sufficiently credible source, as it is a highly reputable and respected newspaper.5. But you say they didn't report the Cape Times version of the story. How was their version different from the one above?This is how the story ran on page 1 of the Cape Times on June 13 1996:Cleaner polishes off patientBy Lindiz van ZillaBLOEMFONTEIN: Health authorities  are investigating a series of deaths of patients who all died mysteriously in the same hospital bed over a period of several weeks.Staff at the Pelonomi Hospital here were baffled when each Friday, they would come across another dead patient. Checks on the air-conditioning system and the position of the bed in relation to the windows failed to provide any clues about the deaths, which occurred two years ago.The ""killer disease"" was uncovered when staff came across a cleaner who had unknowingly unplugged the life-support system to plug in her floor polisher. Every Friday she would enter the ward, plus her polisher into the socket meant for the life-support system and calmly go about her business.Upon completing her chores she would reconnect the life-support system, leaving no trace as to the cause of the patient's death.Despite reports of several deaths in this way, only one is being investigated by the Free State Health and Welfare Department.A hospital spokesperson said he did not know about the incident.6. That sounds vaguely conclusive. But it doesn't quite hang together, does it?That's partly because of space constraints that force most South African newspapers to compress stories that they do not consider of vital importance. In this case, one key sentence was left out of the original report. It went like this:Yesterday, a department [of Health and Welfare] spokesman, Mr Victor Litlhakanyane, said: ""Hospital staff haven't yet confirmed the incident, and we are still investigating it.""Combined with a hospital spokesperson not knowing of the incident, it would have set alarm bells ringing. With that little detail, it becomes clear that the rest of the story, at that stage, remained in the realm of rumour, speculation and hearsay.7. Whoa! That's a pretty detailed story for mere speculation. On the other hand, it's still frustratingly vague. Could it be that the Cape Times picked it up from another source, and then merely made a few phone calls to confirm that it hadn't been made up by a rival source?It could be, and it is the way it happened. The Cape Times' deputy news editor, Sybrand Mostert, spotted the story in Cape Town's Afrikaans-language daily newspaper, Die Burger (literally, ""The Citizen""). The story went like this (as found in Die Burger's online archive ):Page 811 June 1996Pasient sterf glo na werker masjien uitpropBLOEMFONTEIN. Familie van 'n pasient wat in een van die waaksale van die Pelonomi Hospitaal hier gesterf het nadat 'n skoonmaker glo die masjiene wat die pasient aan die lewe moes hou, uitgeprop het, word versoek om na vore te kom. Die skoonmaker het glo die kragprop van haar vloerpoleerder by die muursok ingeprop.Dr. Craig Househam, Vrystaatse adjunk-direkteur-generaal van Gesondheid en Welsyn, het gese hy weet van die voorval van meer as 2 jaar gelede. Hy kon nie se of tugstappe teen die werker gedoen en of die familie van die pasient in die beweerde voorval vergoeding ontvang het nie.Aanvanklike gerugte het gelui meer as een pasient is binne 'n paar agtereenvolgende weke elke Vrydag in dieselfde bed oorlede. Toe personeel begin onraad vermoed, het hulle op die werker afgekom wat Vrydae haar vloerpoleerder inprop by die muursok wat vir die lewensnoodsaaklike masjiene bedoel is.Translation:Patient believed to have died after worker unplugged machineBloemfontein: Family of a patient who died in one of the intensive care wards of the Pelonomi Hospital after a cleaner is understood to have unplugged the life support machine, have been requested to come forward. The cleaner presumably plugged her floor polisher into the wall power socket.Dr Craig Househam, the Free State's deputy director general of Health and Welfare, said he had known about the incident for the past two years. He could not say whether disciplinary steps had been taken against the cleaner or whether the family of the patient in the alleged incident had received any compensation.Initial rumours suggested that more than one patient had died in the same bed every Friday for consecutive weeks. When staff began suspecting something amiss, they discovered the worker who, every Friday, plugged her floor polisher into the wall socket intended for the life support machine.Keep an eye on two key phrase there: aanvankilike gerugte"" and ""beweerde voorval"", which I've translated as ""initial rumours"" and ""alleged incident"".It was assumed at the Cape Times that Die Burger had picked up the story from its sister newspaper in Bloemfontein, Die Volksblad, the only daily newspaper serving the whole Free State province. According to Judith Soal, one of the most Internet-savvy sub-editors (that's the South African equivalent of a copy editor) at the Cape Times, Mostert ""found it interesting, wasn't sure whether or not to believe it, decided to put a reporter on it"".8. So what did the reporter find? Did he speak to Die Volksblad? And did he believe the story?""I never got around to speaking to anyone at the Volksblad,"" Lindiz van Zilla advised me by e-mail. ""I did however phone Pelonomi Hospital and spoke to a medical superintendent on duty who informed me of the ongoing investigation. The hospital did not indicate any knowledge of unusual deaths, but said they too had become aware of rumours - they were basing their investigation on these rumours... I personally don't believe the story - a 'genuine' urban legend.""9. The Cape Times couldn't have been too charmed. Did they then just decide to run with the story and forget about the facts?A part-time sub-editor, who does not want to be named, edited the story. He wasn't sure whether to believe it or not, but was told that it had been discussed and the decision had been made to use it.Judith takes up the story, although she wasn't on duty that night:""I think what made them decide to run it was that the hospital had said it was investigating, giving some credibility to the story... The story was much discussed, and it was decided to run it as a lightish thing, not shock horror, because it couldn't be verified... we gave it a fair amount of prominence because of the newsworthiness of the fact that such a story had got so far, and the bizzareness of it all. The original headline was quite straight - along the lines of 'xx die in hospital', and the revise sub [the senior copy editor who makes final revisions of sub-editors' work] changed it.The revise sub, Don Mallett, takes up the story:""Actually I didn't sub or revise the story. However, I did hear my colleagues discussing it and I read it. When I heard someone sing out a headline about it later, I suggested the headline that eventually appeared. Someone else suggested something about ""patients being unplugged"" and the night editor asked the subs' room which we should use and they went for mine.""I realised fully that the headline was insensitive and in poor taste, but felt this would be considerably cushioned by the facts that the story was a couple of years old, no patients or families were identified, and anyone affected would be far from the Cape Times area of circulation.""Judith continues: ""The weird thing is that Pam, another sub here, was sent an e-mail weeks later, with a much-changed version of the story, but the original Cape Times headline.""10. Did Pam get the version I think she did?Yep, word for word as recorded at the beginning of this document. Pam Sykes sent me a copy of the e-mail, which she had received at the beginning of August, from a contact in Montana, USA. By that time, obviously, it was already feverishly circulating on the Internet. At the time of writing this FAQ, the version circulating on the Internet remains word-for-word identical to the first modified version Pam received.11. Okay, so that's how the Cape Times got the blame. Or is it? How did the story change so dramatically?That is the first structural evidence that it is an urban legend. The attribution of spurious quotes to unnamed authorities, the radical transformation of the story in its re-telling, and then the rapid spread of the story as a result of its shock appeal, are all classic hallmarks of urban legend proliferation. It is impossible to trace the moment of transformation unless the individual responsible for the rewriting confesses.12. How could other media fall for the rewritten story? It even looks made up, aside from the Cape Times reference.That reference was crucial. It was responsible for the next step up the ladder of credibility, when it came to the attention of John Hoyland, editor of the lighthearted Feedback column in the respected British popular science magazine New Scientist . He checked with the Cape Times, first speaking to an archivist, and ""she was very emphatic the story was true"". So he ran the story in Feedback - except that it was the Internet-modified version of the tale. For the sake of completeness, this is how it looked when it left his computer:SOME readers may already have seen this story, which appeared originally in South Africa's Cape Times this summer, and is apparently true. We are passing it on for the unenlightened so that they may reflect on the fickleness of the hand of fate that shapes our destinies.""For several months, our nurses have been baffled to find a dead patient in the same bed every Friday morning,"" a spokeswoman for the Pelonomi Hospital (Free State, South Africa) told reporters. ""There was no apparent cause for any of the deaths, and extensive checks on the air conditioning system, and a search for possible bacterial infection, failed to reveal any clues.""However, further inquiries have now revealed the cause of these deaths. It seems that every Friday morning, a cleaner would enter the ward, remove the plug that powered the patient's life support system, plug her floor polisher into the vacant socket, then go about her business. When she had finished her chores, she would plug the life support machine back in and leave, unaware that the patient was now dead. She could not, after all, hear the screams and eventual death rattle over the whirring of her polisher.""We are sorry, and have sent a strong letter to the cleaner in question. Further, the Free State Health and Welfare Department is arranging for an electrician to fit an extra socket, so there should be no repetition of this incident.""The inquiry is now closed.""Says John: ""Apart from the intro, it's word for word what we got off the Net. The reason for saying 'some readers may have already seen this story' is that the story was apparently run earlier in Private Eye magazine, though I never saw it.""Since then, he says, a colleague had talked to the Cape Times again and, once more, they had ""confirmed"" the story - but this time faxed their original article to New Scientist. And lo and behold, it was a rather different story, at least in terms of attributions and confirmations.""I don't mind admitting that I've been had,"" says John, who cooperated warmly in the construction of this FAQ.12. But he didn't start it, did he? You mentioned Die Volksblad - what does that mean, for starters? And did they run the story first? And has anyone confessed to being the original perpetrator?No, the People's Paper, yes, and yes. One of the people of the people's paper is an investigative journalist who was then their medical correspondent, Andreij Horn. On 11 June 1996, his name appeared under the headline:Inligting gesoek oor gerug dat pasient dood is weens skoonmaker se optredeTranslation:Information sought regarding rumour that patient died due to cleaner's actionsNow that doesn't have quite the same ring as ""Cleaner polishes off patients"", but then Die Volksblad had good reason to play this one low key. The story ran like this (original Afrikaans version is available - note that the simultaneous version from Die Burger was obviously lifted from here, and note too the subtle differences between the opening paragraphs, that gave the version from Die Burger an edge of added credibility and removed the powerful shadow of doubt that hangs over the original version):Family of a patient who died in one of the intensive care wards of the Pelonomi Hospital after a cleaner is understood to have unplugged the life support machine, have been requested to come forward. The cleaner allegedly plugged her floor polisher into the wall power socket.Dr Craig Househam, the Free State's deputy director general of Health and Welfare, had earlier told Die Volksblad he knew about the incident, but that it had happened two-and-a-half years ago, and that Die Volksblad had already reported it.He could not say whether disciplinary steps had been taken against the cleaner or whether the family of the patient in the alleged incident had received any compensation. He first wanted to consult the records, since it had happened under the previous management.Die Volksblad could find no reference to the alleged incident in its own records.This follows repeated tip-offs from various sources over the past month that such an incident had in fact taken place at Pelonomi, and had been hushed up. Initial rumours suggested that more than one patient died in the same bed every Friday in consecutive weeks. When staff began suspecting something amiss, they discovered the worker who, every Friday, plugged her floor polisher into the wall socket intended for the life support machine.Yesterday the Department said that no record of such an incident could be traced. Ms Elke Grobler, public relations officer of the department, said the department knew that such rumours were doing the rounds.""The department requests the family of the patient that allegedly died, or anyone who knew something about this, to come forward, so that the allegations can be properly investigated.""Anyone with information can phone the department on (051) 405-4818.The word ""allegedly"" in the second sentence is translated from the Afrikaans phrase ""na bewering"", which Die Volksblad used in its report. Die Burger changed the word to ""glo"", which is a far softer word for ""allegedly"" and is closer to ""believed to have"" or ""presumed to have"", which removes the slight edge of incredulity that ""allegedly"" imparts to the story. In the eyes of health authorities, however, the story is identical, and they would have had no reason to reject the subsequent interpretation by Die Burger when approached by the Cape Times.13. There's a real, live phone number in there somewhere. Did anyone then phone the Department with more information?No.14. You don't think I'm just going to leave it at that, do you? What about the reporter who started the whole thing?Andreij Horn? Definitely the hero in this epic drama. Not least because he was willing and ready to expand on his role. Had the Department of Health and Welfare not made a specific appeal to the public, he says, he would have dropped the story. It was obvious, he says, that it was an urban legend. Had anyone bothered to ask him, it would never have reached the stage where the world demanded a FAQ. He is extremely happy to recount his role, however, and is most polite about the whole fuss. In a telephonic interview from Bloemfontein on November 12 1996, he said (translated from Afrikaans):""When I first came across these rumours, I thought to myself this looks exactly like an urban legend. I approached the report from the point of view that it was an urban legend, but then the department said that, while they had no information about the incident, they wanted to hear from people who did. Nothing came of their appeal, but that was the angle that resulted in it becoming a worldwide urban legend.""In investigating the story, I went to the top - the Department of Health and Welfare. I did not contact the hospital, because that is not the way the channels work here. The hospital is required to report any unusual incidents. If someone died under such circumstances, a judicial hearing would have to be held.""Even if there had been a conspiracy to hush it up, it is such a sensational story that it could never in a million years be kept quiet. I have no doubt in my mind that, if the department has no record of an investigation into possible malpractice, it is an urban legend.""To tell the truth, it was the department's commitment to transparency [an open approach] that gave momentum to the urban legend. They could have dismissed it as a fairy tale, but were prepared to allow the public to assist with the investigation. Had they not done that, my report would never have appeared. The fact that they took it semi-seriously gave momentum to the spread of the urban legend.""Horn then kindly faxed through a copy of the original story.15. But where did he get the story? How long had it been around before he wrote about it? Where did the whole thing start?Sheesh. It's expensive phoning Bloemfontein all the time with your suspicions. Okay then, this was from a follow-up interview on November 13 1996:""We had been receiving calls for quite some time, I'd say two to three months, from people who asked us why we didn't write about this incident that they had heard happened at Pelonomi Hospital. When it reached my news editor for the second or third time, he said it might be worthwhile investigating the matter. Dr Househam was a classic example of how the story developed in people's heads: he had it in the back of his mind that it had happened more than two years ago, but during the previous administration, so he had no personal knowledge about it, and he thought he had read about it in Die Volksblad.""You have to understand here that Die Volksblad is the most important news and information source in the Free State, and when people think they knew about something because they read it in the newspaper - the way people often retell urban legends - then in the Free State they assume they read it in Die Volksblad.""We went to great lengths to try to track down a report of such an incident in our newspaper. All our stories are pasted on pages, which we went through carefully, and we have a card reference system that includes every story that has appeared in the paper since 1954. If it wasn't in that system, then it definitely had not appeared in our newspaper.""I would estimate that I heard my first version of the story about three months before I wrote the report. I should have reacted sooner, but it was such an unlikely story to me, that I had no faith in the rumour whatsoever. Every version was precisely the same, except for the number of patients that had died. Sometimes it was just one, in other versions people said it had carried on for weeks, and in others up to 14 people had died. The more the bodies, the more indignant people were about how many people had to die before the authorities realised there was a problem.""I cannot imagine such a thing happening in a South African hospital  - that people can die in such a fixed pattern without the authorities investigating - no matter how cynical we become about the possible lowering of standards. It simply does not make sense. And I must add that the fact that the Free State health authorities were so willing to respond instantly was an indication to me of how seriously they take their responsibilities and their image. They are extremely conscientious.""16. Okay, I buy it. We're talking urban legend. But does it behave like other urban legends? Are there variations on this theme? Aside from the different versions of the Pelonomi tale? Are their regional variations, for instance?Sure there are.During August 1996 it took on another necessary characteristics of an urban legend (no, they didn't lynch the cleaning lady). Firstly, the story was told by a caller to the Johannesburg-based radio station 702 as having happened at Baragwanath Hospital (listed in the 1997 Guinness Book of Records as the largest hospital in the world) near Soweto. Ironically and tragically, life imitated UL a few weeks later when two babies died at Baragwanath after a power failure during which the emergency generators also failed due to running out of fuel - but this was the subject of a high-level investigation, officially confirmed, and is not an urban legend.Secondly, in subsequent weeks I heard the story told as word-of-mouth, but having happened at the Johannesburg Hospital. It seems, however, that the Pelonomi version then took a firm grip on the public consciousness - partly thanks to the Internet - and all subsequent versions reverted to the original tale from Bloemfontein.17. So it's an authentic, indigenous South African urban legend?I didn't say that. It is likely that it has been around for decades. Take, for instance, this posting from Christopher Becke to the alt.folklore.urban newsgroup on November 11 1996:On HBO on Sunday morning was a movie starring George Wendt (of Cheers Fame) in some sort of Teacher role.  The movie was called Plain Clothes (1988). In it, one of the characters is telling the other about the untimely demise of the husband (or was it the father) of another character. Apparently, the gentleman was hooked up in an iron lung, and the cleaning woman knocked out the plug with the vacuum cleaner. Although it wasn't a case of unplugging the one to plug in the other, I thought it may have provided a source for the now famous UL.18. Ha! We've found the true origin! Haven't we?Afraid not. I've been told that the story was circulating in Wales in the early 1980s. It is also used as an example in debates among Jewish religious scholars about the acceptability of taking people off life support and allowing them to die naturally. The broadly accepted view is that, while one is not obliged to place someone on life support and can allow them to die naturally if there is little hope of saving them, the picture changes once someone is actually on life support.According to the argument, it is unacceptable for any human being to cut off the life support machine - intentionally - regardless of how hopeless the situation may be, since a decision to end a life may only be taken by God. However, and this is exactly as it was put to me by one scholar, should ""a cleaner accidentally unplug the machine to plug in a cleaning machine, you are not obliged to switch the machine back on again"". Of course, this is a completely theoretical argument, as many of these theological arguments are, and the example is used merely to advance a hypothesis.It is even possible that such hypothetical debates may have sparked the legend, but I have no evidence for that, either.19. So that's where you're going to leave it?Of course not. Anyone with variations on any of the above stories is urged to contact me by e-mail on arthurg@is.co.za , with any material or interpretations that may be added to future versions of this FAQ.20.

Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Friday that he discovered Friday that it fell to him to shut down the government — “which is kind of cool.”Welcome to the whatever shutdown.The attitude permeating the Trump administration reflects, to some degree, the confidence that comes from finding that the world keeps spinning every time they do something they’ve been warned would have dire consequences, like withdrawing from the Paris climate accord or announcing plans to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.According to a half-dozen White House officials and outside advisers, Trump is viewing the shutdown through a similar lens, a view encouraged by White House aides, including senior adviser Stephen Miller and congressional liaison Marc Short, who urged him on Friday not to give in to Democratic demands, particularly on immigration.Several presidential advisers expressed confidence that Democrats, who offered no philosophical objections to the 30-day continuing resolution approved by House Republicans, wanted to make a statement but don’t want to hurt federal workers, tens of thousands of whom will be staying home from work without pay if government funding isn’t restored by Monday morning.Two presidential aides said they expect the current crisis to be resolved by the end of the weekend.But Democrats themselves are sending a different message, at least publicly — giving no indication they are ready to buckle to pressure. “It’s important,” Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said of the shutdown’s impact on federal workers. “But I was just at the women’s march this morning, and there are a lot of federal workers there and … they were basically: ‘You need to stand up to this guy.’”One House Democrat said he was relieved his party had finally “grown a spine.”The most reliable politics newsletter.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning — in your inbox.EmailSign UpBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.The White House has responded by shrugging it off, hewing to a consistent message: This shutdown won’t hurt as much as the one President Barack Obama oversaw five years ago.Mulvaney drew the comparison repeatedly on Saturday, telling reporters that national parks and monuments would remain open, though they were closed in 2013; that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would continue to protect Americans from this year’s flu outbreak; and that, in another departure from five years ago, the activities of the Environmental Protection Agency would continue uninterrupted.He also argued that Democrats today are being more unreasonable than were Republicans in 2013. “We were asked to vote for something in 2013 that we did not approve of,” said Mulvaney, who, as a South Carolina congressman, supported the 2013 shutdown because the government-funding bill required lawmakers to approve funding for Obamacare, a federal program to which they vehemently objected.Other West Wing aides were playing it cool as well.Whose Fault Is the Shutdown?By POLITICO STAFF“This seems so banal compared to 2013, when the two sides were actually fired up and there was a cause,” said a senior presidential aide. The 2013 shutdown, precipitated by Republican attempts to prevent funds from flowing to the Affordable Care Act, lasted 17 days. “Everybody figures this is going to resolve itself by the end of the weekend,” the aide said.“It will be nothing compared to Obama’s shutdown,” said another senior White House official, though the 2013 shutdown was roundly blamed on Republicans.Trump himself, who has yet to appear in public since the shutdown early Saturday morning, is sticking with the message that Democrats will take most of the heat, though he privately joked to staff that he knows he’ll get blamed — because he always does.Though he hasn’t appeared before the cameras, he was active on Twitter throughout the day on Saturday, writing: “This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present. #DemocratShutdown .”In photos released late Saturday by the White House, Trump and top staff appeared relaxed and smiling.Joyce N. Boghosian/Official White House photoWhite House aides said that they think Trump’s Twitter microphone is enough, and they don’t believe the president needs to make official remarks to bring the shutdown to a close.Indeed, Trump’s own erratic behavior in negotiations last week — including his remarks to lawmakers that many immigrants come from “shithole” countries — helped precipitate the breakdown in spending talks on the Hill by hardening the positions among party rank-and-file on both sides and giving Democrats a ready-made excuse to walk away from the negotiating table on immigration.Since then, he’s been a bit player in the shutdown drama — the absence of his direction and leadership driving events more than their presence.By BRENT D. GRIFFITHSThe irony is that while many had high hopes that Trump’s election augured a new era of bipartisanship in the country, the government shutdown is the clearest evidence yet that that hasn’t materialized.Instead, a year into his first term, the president — who won the election railing against the political system — finds himself trapped inside it, waiting for the political leaders he holds in contempt to set him free.Annie Karni and Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.	1

Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), who said the current law discriminated against those who have human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, the precursor to AIDS, because exposure to other communicable diseases is a misdemeanor.The same reduction in crime level would apply to people who donate blood or semen without disclosing that they have tested positive for HIV or AIDS.Read More— Phil Willon (@philwillon) October 19, 2017AdvertisementOct. 2, 2017, 3:23 p.m.California LegislatureCalifornia farmworkers will have to undergo sexual assault prevention trainingGov.

Nigerian officials posted pictures on social media this week revealing the horrors of the Libya’s modern-day slave trafficking. GETTYShareWorld Libya Slave tradeUpdate | A burned corpse hanging upside down. Three men standing side by side with scars covering the wounds from their stolen internal organs. Human beings for sale.Those are the searing images of the modern-day slavery taking place across Libya, posted by a former Nigerian minister after a CNN investigation  revealed that Nigerian migrants were being sold into slavery by smugglers for $200.“Roasted alive,” tweeted former Nigerian aviation minister Femi Fani-Kayode. “This is what Libyans do to sub-Saharan Africans who are looking for a transit point to Europe. They sell them into slavery and either murder, mutilate, torture or work them to death.” Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowFani-Kayode quoted a report claiming that 75 percent of those sold into the Libyan slave trade were southern Nigerians who'd had their organs harvested and their bodies burned or mutilated.It is unclear whether Fani-Kayode's images are authentic. In the one featuring the burned corpse, a soldier standing nearby is wearing an Iraqi military uniform, suggesting that the picture was not connected to the Libyan slave trade.But it is clear that the former government minister was trying to put pressure on current Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari for remaining silent on the trade of his people. Buhari did finally make a statement after the photos were posted, saying he would bring back the Nigerians stranded in Libya and discourage Nigerians from fleeing the country.“We will ensure they all return home safely and are rehabilitated,” he said.Fani-Kayode is pushing Nigeria to go to war with Libya.“If there were ever a reason or cause for us to go to war, the Libyans have provided it by enslaving our people and buying and selling them like Christmas turkeys and sallah goats,” he tweeted, posting an image that may not be authentic. “No human being deserves to be caged like an animal and roasted like suya meat. ”So far, 242 Nigerians have been returned from Libya. A majority had been living in detention camps, while others asked to be brought back home, according to CNN . The United Nations Security Council met in an emergency session this week to consider applying sanctions and the full range of international law against the smugglers involved in the slave trade.Celebrities including musical artist Pharrell Williams, rapper Common and civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton brought attention to the cause, tweeting about the slave trade to their millions of followers. This story was updated to strengthen the suspicion that Fani-Kayode's Twitter posts featured inauthentic pictures designed to pressure Nigeria to attack Libya.	1

The contamination has also resulting in the closure of fishing industries.Worryingly, new studies reveal that fish caught off the West coast of the United States and in Canada are also being tested positive for radiation poisoning.This page is forcing your browser to use legacy mode, which is not compatible with Disqus.

Portlands city council on Wednesday voted 3 to 1 in favor of the Equal Use Act, a new resolution granting individuals who identify as furries the same rights afforded to dogs and their respective owners who frequent popular off-leash areas and dog parks in the greater Portland area.The decision comes on the heels of a four-day sit-in organized by PDX Furs, a regional furry community based in the Portland metro area, which staged the protest at Portlands city council offices on Milwaukie Avenue last weekend. This is a huge victory, said Bo Kirkman. Not just for furries here in Portland but furries living all across the United States.Bo, a former kindergarten teacher and self-described furry rights advocate, told the Portland Tribune that he identifies as a dog. Its one thing to say you cant bring your cat or your ferret or whatever to the off-leash areas because obviously theyre not dogs. But if I want to go to the park and play with my owner, well as a canine, that should be my right.Now, thanks to the City of Portland, Bo and his fellow furries can take advantage of the citys designated off-leash areas. Provided they respect and adhere to the posted rules and regulations at our city parks, said Public Affairs commissioner Dan Saltzman who sits on the city council and voted in favor of the resolution.According to the City of Portlands official website, dog park visitors are expected to pick up and dispose of their pets waste and are advised to leave sick animals at home. In an effort to prevent the spread of disease, we ask that owners refrain from allowing their dogs  or furries  drink from standing water, Saltzman said.However, not everyone is celebrating the new resolution.. I think its rediculous, said council-member Amanda Fritz who sits on the Portland Parks Board and voted against the proposal.

It’s a double standard. There shouldn’t be a black history month. We’re Americans, period.” Well, she definitely started a conversation… and has agreement in unexpected places:1.  Listen to what famous rapper Waka Flocka said:He said:“But honestly, I always felt like that. Like why the f**k we got BET? BET is for black people and MTV is for white people? Think about it. Why the f**k we got Black History Month only in February? How can the people that took our history, give us our history for one month? Just think about it.”I have to admit, I don’t know who “Waka Flocka” is, or what he sings, but I agree with him on this! 2.  Listen to what rapper, writer, actor, director Ice Cube said about the  #OscarSoWhite controversy :“We don’t do movies for the industry. We do movies for the fans, for the people,” Ice Cube said Friday. “To cry about not winning an award is like crying because you don’t have enough icing on your cake!”Though he didn’t mention Stacey by name, isn’t it interesting how he echoed her sentiments exactly?We shouldn’t segregate ourselves or limit Black History Month to one month a year. I wish things were really colorblind… I don’t know what we can do as a society to come together as one.Ss far as what I have seen about the #OscarSoWhiteControversy, it seems  Jada Smith started it because her husband wasn’t getting nominated.I don’t know how other people think about it, but I hope my son sees early on – that not everyone gets a trophy.Buy my Mom’s new devotional, Sweet Freedom, in bookstores everywhere!	1

The explosion, which appears to have originated in the basement, was heard nearly three miles away. The closest neighbor, a farm nearly a mile away, felt what they thought was a “mild earthquake. When first-responders arrived on site, they found a huge hole in the center of the ranch and bodies strewn about the surrounding area.Fire Marshall Sandy Batternofski said that the blast looked like the product of some sort of illegal activity:“There was a massive amount of pressure built up from something before it ignited. Then it burned so fast it incinerated everything in its path. The victims look like overcooked chicken wings. Gonna be tough to ID them.”We asked Police Chief Matt Schmidt what he thought and he never skipped a beat when he said:“Meth. No doubt about it. Al’s got some explaining to do.”Ex-Senator Franken, who lives in a penthouse in Minneapolis with his mistress, told police he hadn’t been to the ranch in over a year and that his brother Randy was looking after it for him. When asked about the obvious existence of a meth lab, Franken snorted and hung up the phone.We’ll update the story when the bodies are identified.     .About Flagg Eagleton  44 ArticlesFlagg Eagleton is the son of an American potato farmer and a patriot.

He was taking summer classes at his high school and left the classroom for what was supposed to be a quick call to a documentary crew preparing a feature on the rivalry with De La Salle High School in Northern California.“I stepped outside to make the phone call and I ran into a classmate of mine,” Banks says.Her name was Wanetta Gibson. She was a friend. She was 15.“We met, hugged, started talking and agreed to go to an area on our campus that was known as a make-out area,” Banks says. “We went to this area and made out. We never had sex.”By the end of the day, Banks was in custody, accused of raping Gibson on the school’s campus. But we never had sex, Banks pleaded. Nobody believed him.“I was being arrested and accused of kidnapping and rape,” he says. “I was taken into custody that same day and the judge put a bail on me that was too high for me to post bond. It was over $1 million.”He languished in juvenile hall for an entire year before his case came up. He was to be tried as an adult and if found guilty, faced 41 years to life. His football dreams effectively died that summer day in the stairwell of his school.Life isn’t fair.Brian Banks was an innocent man.Brian Banks weeps upon hearing judge clear his name in May of 2012.(Brittany Murray/ASSOCIATED PRESS)***After turning down three plea deals that would have put him in prison for 25, 18 or nine years, Banks was told on the day of jury selection “that I had no chance in trial because I was a big, black teenager and the jury would be an all-white jury and they would automatically assume me as guilty because of that,” Banks says.Gibson was also black, as was Banks’ attorney. As the jury was about to be selected, Banks was offered a deal to plead guilty to one count of rape under the condition that the other charges would be dropped. He would then undergo a 90-day observation at Chino State prison and would be interviewed and evaluated by psychologists and counselors “who would determine on a ladder system whether I would receive probation or three or six years prison,” Banks says. “I was promised and guaranteed by my attorney that I would get probation if I took the plea. I was also told that if I didn’t take it, I would more than likely be found guilty and receive life in prison.”He was 17 years old. “Do I plead to a crime that I did not commit and receive a small sentence or do I roll the dice, risk my entire life behind bars for a crime I didn’t commit?” he says. “I realized that day, regardless of whatever my decision was, neither one of them was going home an innocent man.”All he could think about was getting his life back, going home, playing football, finishing his high school education, enrolling at USC. They put him in a room and gave him 10 minutes to make his decision. He sat there crying. “I was unable to speak to my mom. I was denied that right,” he says. “At the age of 17, I felt like 90 days was doable after already spending a year behind bars.”He underwent the 90-day observation. The psychologist and counselor recommended probation. The judge gave him six years. He had never been in trouble before, not even a speeding ticket. He sat in the holding cell, held both hands up, shaking uncontrollably as he figured out that he would have to serve 85% of the six years. He had already served one year. That meant he still had just over four years remaining.“Just the trauma and the stress that I had already dealt with that first year, it was unimaginable how I was going to do another four years,” he says.He went to jail with career criminals. He was angry, depressed, hostile. He saw fights, stabbings, killings right in front of him, riots, lockdowns.He saw hell.Banks lost 10 years of his life, a frightful five years and two months in prison followed by five years of high custody parole.After his release in 2007, he moved back in with his mother, a second-grade schoolteacher who had sold her house and car to pay his attorney fees. At 22 he tried to resume his football career at Long Beach City College. He played in a game two days after his release, a good way to take out aggression. But after playing a handful of games before the season ended, a new law went into effect in California requiring sex offenders to wear an ankle GPS tracking device, making it impossible for him to play football.He had already registered as a sex offender and couldn’t live within 2,000 yards of a school or park. He had trouble finding work.“I wanted revenge,” Banks says. “I wanted people to be held accountable for the things that happened to me.”The past is the past. It already happened. Tomorrow is a mystery.Life’s not fair, Banks thought. I’m an innocent man.***Three years ago, Banks was checking his Facebook account and got a start. He had been home for four years working odd jobs, still carrying the label of sex offender. But there, staring him in the face, was a friend request.“It was her,” Banks says, “the girl who had accused me nine years ago.”Banks still doesn’t know her reasoning for selling him down the river when she knew they never had sex and there was no DNA trace on her underwear. Maybe it was the $1.5 million she collected from the Long Beach school system, claiming it was an unsafe environment (the city is trying to recoup $2.6 million from her now). Banks thinks maybe Gibson was afraid her older sister, who went to the same high school, would find out she made out with him and tell her mother. Or that he would brag to friends. Maybe she thought he would just be suspended. He doesn’t think she was trying to put him in jail. He also thinks perhaps a school security guard saw her leaving the stairwell with him, asked what she was doing and if she wanted to do it.“Oh well, then he raped you,” Banks surmises the guard said.“We don’t really know what the truth really is as to why she lied,” he says. “I never really got a clear reason.”Banks never had contact with her from the day they made out until that day on Facebook in 2011.He asked why she would request him.“I was hoping we could let bygones be bygones,” Banks says Gibson wrote. “I was immature back in the day, but I’m much more mature now. Let’s hang out. I’d love to see you. I’ve seen your picture on Facebook. You look real good. I would love to hook up.”Banks obviously had no interest.His parole agreement didn’t allow him any contact with her. Banks called a private investigator and said he felt there was an opportunity for her to tell the truth and he wanted it recorded.“In the event that I violated my parole conditions coming into contact with her and was sent back to prison, I wanted them to at least know what was said,” Banks says. “I took a big risk. I knew this was the only opportunity to prove my innocence by her admitting she lied.”In 2013, Atlanta's Brian Banks faces Cincinnati.(Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images)He invited Wanetta Gibson to the investigator’s office. They spoke with the investigator monitoring in another room. Banks wanted her to understand what she did to his life. He asked her to come back the second day to speak to the investigator.“Did he rape you? Did he kidnap you?” the investigator asked.Banks said she laughed it off and said, “Of course not. If he raped me, I wouldn’t be here right now. We were just young and having a good time, being curious, then all these other people got involved and blew it out of proportion.”It was all on tape. Banks took it to the California Innocence Project, which took his case and appealed it.One year later, three months before he was to come off parole, Banks was cleared.On May 24, 2012, the same Los Angeles Superior Court judge who had sentenced Banks to six years in prison when he begrudgingly accepted a plea bargain for a crime he did not commit after he was led to believe he would get probation, took less than one minute to dismiss his conviction.He was already a free man. But now he had his freedom.“My record is cleaner than yours,” he says.He’s not bitter, he’s not looking for an apology. He didn’t sue anybody.“When you put yourself in position where you have to make a decision whether you forgive somebody or you don’t, that means you are still dealing with it,” Banks says. “I’m not dealing with it anymore. The past is the past. It already happened. Tomorrow is a mystery.”***Banks tried football again after gaining back his full freedom. Carroll, the coach Banks wanted to play for at Southern Cal and the first coach to give him a tryout once he was exonerated in 2012, and who will be coaching in his second consecutive Super Bowl next Sunday, brought him to Seattle for a tryout the day after all charges were dropped.Banks remembers when his cell phone rang.Brian Banks has a moment with his mother, Leomia Myers and father, Jonathan Banks, outside courthouse.(Nick Ut/ASSOCIATED PRESS)“I’m looking for a linebacker. You know where I can find one?” the caller says.“You got the right number. Who is this?” Banks says.“Pete Carroll,” he says. “You’ve been out of the game 10 years. I don’t know what the hell you can do. But I’m going to fly you out here because I know how hard you work. I just want to see what you can do.”One year before he was exonerated, Banks had been up to 290 pounds. He then started training and within three months was down to 245 pounds when he went to Seattle.“It was a terrible tragedy in a young man’s life, to be falsely accused like that and have to give up years of his life,” Carroll said in an e-mail to the Daily News. “I don’t think anyone could’ve handled something like that any better. He was strong, gracious and compassionate, and he exhibited great character and integrity.”Banks was thrilled to hear from Carroll.“We reconnected and it was like we were back on that same path to where we left off recruiting,” he says. “Here we were once again.”But the football part didn’t work out. It had been too long.“I tried out. They were impressed,” Banks says. “They invited me back to camp. I trained in camp with them. They decided it was a little premature and they decided not to roll with me.”He had tryouts with the 49ers, Chiefs, Vikings, Chargers, Eagles and Falcons.Nobody signed him. It had been 10 years since he had really played.“You could tell he had missed some years of ball,” Carroll says. “He missed out on the physical development a college athlete gets and all that comes with that process. He missed the opportunity to hone his physical and mental skills as it relates to football, but his competitiveness shined through and he battled so hard for that chance, and did a phenomenal job with his opportunity.”Former Giants coach Jim Fassel then signed Banks for the Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League. He played linebacker and special teams before the league folded during the 2012 season after Banks had played in just a couple of games.Brian Banks exits court after his kidnap-rape conviction was dismissed.(Brittany Murray/AP)“I heard about his story and as a coach, you just say ‘Gosh sakes, what this man has gone through and his attitude is still positive,’ ” Fassel says by phone last week. “This guy deserved somebody to give him a chance. It was amazing he wasn’t bitter, but he was really, really raw.”The Falcons reached out again in 2013, signed him in the offseason, brought him to camp. He played in all four preseason games, but was let go on the final cut from 75 players to 53.Banks, officially, was done. He was just 28 years old. His formative years in football were spent shuttling between adult prisons in California.“He was an all-star player and set himself apart in high school, so if he had gotten the chance, it’s clear he definitely could’ve been a legitimate NFL prospect,” Carroll said.***Who knows what would have happened to Banks if his life had not been derailed?“I don’t really wonder. I know,” Banks says. “I know I would have been a force to be reckoned with in the NFL.""Banks is 29 now and dressed in a dark suit sitting in the office of Troy Vincent, the NFL’s executive vice president of football operations, in the league’s Park Avenue headquarters. He began working for the NFL in the football operations department at the beginning of the 2014 season. On game days, he helps out in the officiating department with replays.Vincent and Roger Goodell brought him in because he’s a bright and eager guy. He also has a riveting message that might make an impact on some of the players in the NFL.“Very few people could even endure what happened to Brian, much less emerge with such resilience and determination,” Vincent says. “I saw a young man who was dealt a bad hand, but he refused to allow it to deter him from pursuing his dream to be part of the NFL.""Now he might be on his way to becoming a star in the NFL office.“He’s a great guy,” Goodell says.For Banks, the dream is once again alive.“If you ask me, I made an NFL roster and that’s here in the front office in New York,” he says. “I still wear the shield. I accomplished a dream that was taken away from me.”He now does volunteer work for the California Innocence Project. A movie is being made about his life. Banks also has developed a business speaking to schools all over the country. He has a strong message and an appropriate T-shirt.It’s a California license plate that says, XONR8. Sign up for BREAKING NEWS Emails"	1

https://www.snopes.com/cashews-equivalent-to-a-dose-of-prozac/	Are Two Handfuls of Cashews Equivalent to a Dose of Prozac for Depression?	false	['antidepressants', ' dangerous memes', ' david avocado wolfe', ' depression', ' newz magazine']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/9n36j	2016/12/30	SEND Pinterest Google Skype Reddit-Cashew nuts are one of the healthiest foods in the world. Unfortunately, not many of you know the numerous benefits they offer, and only a very small percentage of the natural medicines comprehensive database is dedicated to them.Countries like Nigeria, Tanzania, Mozambique and Brazil are the biggest producers of cashew nuts, mostly due to the fact that they need hot and humid climate in order to grow.Health Benefits of Cashew NutsCashew nuts are rich in vitamins, soluble dietary fiber, minerals and many phytochemicals that prevent diseases, including cancers. Cashews are also rich in calories, about 50 grams of these favorable foods contain 275 calories.These beneficial nuts provide numerous essential vitamins, including pantothenic acid or vitamin B5, pyridoxine or vitamin B6, thiamin or vitamin B11 and riboflavinThe aforementioned vitamins are crucial for metabolism of fat, protein and carbs at a cellular level. On the other hand, niacin improves the protection against pellagra or dermatitis.Furthermore, B6 is extremely beneficial for our health for it significantly lowers the chances of developing sideroblastic anemia and homocystinuria. Only 3.5 Oz (100 gr) of these nuts provide about 30% of daily recommended levels of B6 (that’s about 0.147 mg).Moreover, cashews are also rich in essential minerals. Some of the most useful minerals found in cashew nuts are potassium, manganese, copper, selenium, magnesium, zinc and iron. Only a handful of these nuts on a daily basis can provide the necessary amount of these extremely needed minerals and protect you from deficiency- related diseases.For instance, copper acts as a co-factor for many important enzymes, like superoxide dismutase and cytochrome c- oxidase. Zinc, on the other hand, plays the same role together with enzymes that are responsible for the regulation of the growth and progress of digestion, gonadal function and DNA synthesis. Selenium is a very important micronutrient and it works as a co-factor for antioxidant enzymes like Glutathione peroxides, known as one of the strongest antioxidants in human body.Monounsaturated fatty acids which are in high quantities in these nuts are extremely good for the heart health, as palmitoleic and oleic acids. They belong to the group of essential fatty acids that can increase the level of good HDL cholesterol and decrease the level of harmful LDLcholesterol in our blood. In addition, as shown by many scientific studies, the so-called Mediterranean diet which is mostly based on monounsaturated fatty acids supports the blood lipid profile, and protect our system from strokes and coronary artery diseases.Furthermore, cashews also contain a small quantity of one very important pigment of flavonoid antioxidants, called zeaxanthin, which is selectively absorbed inside the retinal macula in our eyes. This pigment provides protective and antioxidant UV ray filtering features, and it also protects from ARMD or age-related macular degeneration in old people.How Treat Depression Naturally – A Basic Guide to Cashew NutritionCashew nuts are more than great source of tryptophan, which is a vital amino acid our body needs to take it throughout the food. This amino acid helps children develop and grow, regulates mood, balances our behavior, improves sleep and can significantly lower the level of stress, anxiety and depression.Just two handfuls of cashews contain somewhere between 1.000 and 2.000 mg of tryptophan. This compound has been proven to be as equally successful as prescription antidepressants. The best thing about treating depression with cashews is that you will surely avoid side effects that are usually caused by antidepressants. Of course, this is yet another thing big pharma carefully hides from us.According to FDA Deputy Commissioner for Policy’s David Adams, who was part of the Drug Information Association Annual Meeting back in 1993, we need to pay close attention to the things happening around the legal arena and dietary supplements. If producers of natural remedies manage getting the support, there will most likely be a completely new class of products, which will be competing with the already existing drugs. This is why we need a special law that will have the function to regulate the supplements.In addition, back in 1993, FDA Dietary Task Force has released a report saying that the selling and existence of dietary supplements will not jeopardize efforts for creating new drugs.Sponsored by Revcontent	1

The 2003 painting by Simmie Knox shows a smiling Clinton sporting one of her signature pantsuits, standing by a table with her book, “It Takes a Village,” by her side.ADVERTISEMENTThe White House calls this year’s theme “The Gift of the Holidays,” one that “reflects on not only the joy of giving and receiving, but also the true gifts of life, such as service, friends and family, education, and good health.”Supersized versions of the presidential pooches, Bo and Sunny, greet guests in the East Wing Hallway. The first dog-inspired creations, which measured slightly taller than ITK’s towering 5’4” frame, were crafted from more than 25,000 yarn pom-poms.A tree adorned with gold stars represents “The Gift of Service,” which pays homage to first lady Michelle ObamaMichelle LeVaughn Robinson Obama Michelle Obama celebrates success of ‘Black Panther’ How textbooks shape teachers — not just their students Michelle Obama dedicates Valentine's Day playlist to Barack Obama MORE and Dr. Jill Biden’s Joining Forces initiative, aimed at supporting military service members and their families. Kiosks with touch screens can be used to pen a note to send to troops.Another snowy display might prove more controversial. Not only do snowmen occupy the space next to the Clinton portrait — they line the entire hall.Similar snowmen stoked fear among the Washington press corps last year, when ITK tweeted a picture of a countless number of ever-smiling figures peering into the White House from outside. Bloomberg White House correspondent Justin Sink dubbed the frozen creatures “nightmare fuel.”But everything is awesome in the State Dining Room, with 56 gingerbread houses — one for each state and territory — created out of Legos. South Dakota’s gingerbread house features a pretty impressive Lego version of Mount Rushmore. More than 200,000 of the colorful blocks were used to decorate the room, and Lego master builders spent 500 hours designing and crafting the structures.In the Green and Red rooms, visitors can find a seasonal ode to Michelle Obama’s “Let’s Move!” anti-childhood obesity initiative, with wreaths made of lemons and garlands created using limes. The fruit-filled rooms also feature gift boxes made out of cranberries.This year’s White House gingerbread house was whipped up using 150 pounds of gingerbread on the inside and 100 pounds of bread dough on the outside. The behemoth baked good also includes 20 pounds of gum paste, 20 pounds of icing and 20 pounds of sculpted sugar pieces.A sugary sweet Bo and Sunny stand outside the massive confection, along with a giant gingerbread man and woman. The gingerbread woman is seen holding a gingerbread baby.But even the spicy-sweet smell of the sugar-coated display couldn’t get one journalist salivating over the gigantic treat. “Can we all accept now that gingerbread is only good as a building material?” a photographer quipped. 	1
https://www.snopes.com/bill-oreilly-beaten/	Bill O’Reilly in Critical Condition After Being Attacked by ‘Tolerant’ Liberals?	false	"[""america's last line of defense"", "" bill o'reilly""]"	http://www.newsweek.com/	http://www.newsweek.com/bill-oreillys-podcast-defiant-ever-dull-never-589662	2017/05/09	"By Alexander NazaryanOn 4/25/17 at 12:05 PMBill O'Reilly on the set of his show ""The O'Reilly Factor"" in New York on March 17, 2015. Brendan McDermid/ReutersShareU.S.Last week, Bill O’Reilly returned from a European vacation to find that he had been fired from Fox News for a history of alleged sexual misbehavior that is impressively wide-ranging, even for the Viagra warehouse that has functioned for near decades as the mouthpiece of the Republican Party.This week, O’Reilly left for vacation again; his destination this time was not Italy but the Isle of Unreality, a remote location favored by right-wingers seeking to escape lawsuits and facts.No longer will O’Reilly be a factor, so to speak, in the fortunes of the right-wing cable news channel that brought his visage, puckered with outrage, into the homes of millions. Even as advertisers fled his show over the past two months, he crushed the competition like a Republican congressman in Texas, drawing 3.8 million per night viewers in early April. Now, all he has is a measly podcast, No Spin News, and a website that does an excellent impression of 1999.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowO’Reilly’s first post-firing podcast went live on Monday. Television endowed O’Reilly with a kind of gleeful menace that was weirdly captivating for those of us who disagreed with him on everything, including the title of “journalist” he gave himself; unseen, he loses power—and seems to know it. Yet at heart, the project is the same, a promise of “no spin” bolstered by sturdy beams of vitriol and misinformation.O’Reilly began with pure, uncut, right-into-your-bloodstream spin, also known as damage control. “I am sad that I am not on television anymore,” he said. “I was surprised how it all turned out.” He may mean that he thought the $13 million he and Fox News paid out to various accusers ensured their silence. Or maybe he thought that a recent endorsement from Donald Trump—“I don't think Bill did anything wrong”—would save him.But O’Reilly really wasn’t going to spend all his podcast time talking about that unseemly business, not with the forces of liberalism amassing at the borders of Real America. There was much news to cover, many spins to un-spin or stop the spins from spinning or cause to the spins to spin in a countervailing motion, thereby creating a spin-neutral zone. He began by denouncing numbers, specifically those tied to President Trump’s approval ratings. If those numbers seem low, he explained, it’s not because Trump has been an ineffectual, easily distracted head of state but because the mainstream media “deceive” Americans “on a daily basis.”I can’t claim to be a regular Fox News viewer, but I’ve seen and heard enough of O’Reilly (Mom loves the guy…) to know that something was amiss on this podcast. The day’s news was a slab of red meat, but instead of tearing into it, O’Reilly timidly nibbled at the edges. When I hear the boredom in O’Reilly’s voice, I worry for the future of the Republic.“Don’t react to these polls,” he advised Trump, like a weary coach telling his charges to hustle. O’Reilly had to know that Trump had already reacted to those polls on Twitter (you can imagine how), so why offer political advice that’s not only hackneyed but outdated?Little else about the 20-minute show was remarkable—which was the most remarkable thing about it. Without much gusto, he covered the French election (“Marnie” Le Pen) and conservative commentator Ann Coulter’s feud with the University of California at Berkeley (“a place I would never in a million years go to”).“Interesting,” he said of the Berkeley issue. “Very, very interesting.” To show just how interesting it was, he followed with a long “um…”Frankly, I could have used a little, um, spin. In what I take as an ominous sign, the word of the day flashed in a banner atop the O’Reilly website. The word on Monday was sciolistic, which means “concerned with or comprehending only what is apparent or obvious; not deep or penetrating emotionally or intellectually.”Was some dastardly young web editor trolling O’Reilly? Or was O’Reilly nobly unspinning himself? The latter is unlikely. Like the man in the Oval Office, O’Reilly never backs down when presented with evidence of his own misconduct or deception. To the contrary, both men puff up their chests and grow indignant, mistakenly thinking that they stand on high ground, when they are in fact treading along the crumbling edge of a cliff.“I’m very confident the truth will come out,” O’Reilly said at the opening of his podcast.It already has, Bill."	1

Pedophiles to FBI?	false	['fake news', ' harvey weinstein', ' hollywood', ' neon nettle', ' sexual assault']	https://www.nytimes.com/	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html	2017/10/21	Harvey Weinstein Paid Off Sexual Harassment Accusers for DecadesImageHarvey Weinstein apologized for behavior that he said “has caused a lot of pain.”CreditJean Baptiste LaCroix/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesBy Jodi Kantor and Megan TwoheyOct. 5, 2017Update: The Weinstein Company’s board has fired Harvey Weinstein after reports of sexual harassment complaints against him. Find more coverage here .Two decades ago, the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein invited Ashley Judd to the Peninsula Beverly Hills hotel for what the young actress expected to be a business breakfast meeting. Instead, he had her sent up to his room, where he appeared in a bathrobe and asked if he could give her a massage or she could watch him shower, she recalled in an interview.“How do I get out of the room as fast as possible without alienating Harvey Weinstein?” Ms. Judd said she remembers thinking.In 2014, Mr. Weinstein invited Emily Nestor, who had worked just one day as a temporary employee, to the same hotel and made another offer: If she accepted his sexual advances, he would boost her career, according to accounts she provided to colleagues who sent them to Weinstein Company executives. The following year, once again at the Peninsula, a female assistant said Mr. Weinstein badgered her into giving him a massage while he was naked, leaving her “crying and very distraught,” wrote a colleague, Lauren O’Connor, in a searing memo asserting sexual harassment and other misconduct by their boss.“There is a toxic environment for women at this company,” Ms. O’Connor said in the letter, addressed to several executives at the company run by Mr. Weinstein.An investigation by The New York Times found previously undisclosed allegations against Mr. Weinstein stretching over nearly three decades, documented through interviews with current and former employees and film industry workers, as well as legal records, emails and internal documents from the businesses he has run, Miramax and the Weinstein Company.During that time, after being confronted with allegations including sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact, Mr. Weinstein has reached at least eight settlements with women, according to two company officials speaking on the condition of anonymity. Among the recipients, The Times found, were a young assistant in New York in 1990, an actress in 1997, an assistant in London in 1998, an Italian model in 2015 and Ms. O’Connor shortly after, according to records and those familiar with the agreements.In a statement to The Times on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Weinstein said: “I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it. Though I’m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go.”He added that he was working with therapists and planning to take a leave of absence to “deal with this issue head on.”Lisa Bloom, a lawyer advising Mr. Weinstein, said in a statement that “he denies many of the accusations as patently false.” In comments to The Times earlier this week, Mr. Weinstein said that many claims in Ms. O’Connor’s memo were “off base” and that they had parted on good terms.ImageSome of Mr. Weinstein’s films include, from left to right, “Sex, Lies, and Videotape,” “Pulp Fiction” and “Good Will Hunting.”He and his representatives declined to comment on any of the settlements, including providing information about who paid them. But Mr. Weinstein said that in addressing employee concerns about workplace issues, “my motto is to keep the peace.”Ms. Bloom, who has been advising Mr. Weinstein over the last year on gender and power dynamics, called him “an old dinosaur learning new ways.” She said she had “explained to him that due to the power difference between a major studio head like him and most others in the industry, whatever his motives, some of his words and behaviors can be perceived as inappropriate, even intimidating.”Though Ms. O’Connor had been writing only about a two-year period, her memo echoed other women’s complaints. Mr. Weinstein required her to have casting discussions with aspiring actresses after they had private appointments in his hotel room, she said, her description matching those of other former employees. She suspected that she and other female Weinstein employees, she wrote, were being used to facilitate liaisons with “vulnerable women who hope he will get them work.”The allegations piled up even as Mr. Weinstein helped define popular culture. He has collected six best-picture Oscars and turned out a number of touchstones, from the films “ Sex, Lies, and Videotape ,” “ Pulp Fiction ” and “ Good Will Hunting ” to the television show “ Project Runway .” In public, he presents himself as a liberal lion, a champion of women and a winner of not just artistic but humanitarian awards.In 2015, the year Ms. O’Connor wrote her memo, his company distributed “ The Hunting Ground ,” a documentary about campus sexual assault. A longtime Democratic donor, he hosted a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton in his Manhattan home last year. He employed Malia Obama, the oldest daughter of former President Barack Obama, as an intern this year, and recently helped endow a faculty chair at Rutgers University in Gloria Steinem’s name. During the Sundance Film Festival in January, when Park City, Utah, held its version of nationwide women’s marches, Mr. Weinstein joined the parade.ImageHarvey Weinstein and Hillary Clinton in 2012. Mr. Weinstein held a fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton at his Manhattan home last year.CreditLarry Busacca/Getty Images“From the outside, it seemed golden — the Oscars, the success, the remarkable cultural impact,” said Mark Gill, former president of Miramax Los Angeles when the company was owned by Disney. “But behind the scenes, it was a mess, and this was the biggest mess of all,” he added, referring to Mr. Weinstein’s treatment of women.Dozens of Mr. Weinstein’s former and current employees, from assistants to top executives, said they knew of inappropriate conduct while they worked for him. Only a handful said they ever confronted him.Mr. Weinstein enforced a code of silence; employees of the Weinstein Company have contracts saying they will not criticize it or its leaders in a way that could harm its “business reputation” or “any employee’s personal reputation,” a recent document shows. And most of the women accepting payouts agreed to confidentiality clauses prohibiting them from speaking about the deals or the events that led to them.Charles Harder, a lawyer representing Mr. Weinstein, said it was not unusual to enter into settlements to avoid lengthy and costly litigation. He added, “It’s not evidence of anything.”At Fox News, where the conservative icons Roger E. Ailes and Bill O’Reilly were accused of harassment, women have received payouts well into the millions of dollars. But most of the women involved in the Weinstein agreements collected between roughly $80,000 and $150,000, according to people familiar with the negotiations.In the wake of Ms. O’Connor’s 2015 memo, some Weinstein Company board members and executives, including Mr. Weinstein’s brother and longtime partner, Bob , 62, were alarmed about the allegations, according to several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the end, though, board members were assured there was no need to investigate. After reaching a settlement with Mr. Weinstein, Ms. O’Connor withdrew her complaint and thanked him for the career opportunity he had given her.“The parties made peace very quickly,” Ms. Bloom said.Through her lawyer, Nicole Page, Ms. O’Connor declined to be interviewed. In the memo, she explained how unnerved she was by what she witnessed or encountered while a literary scout and production executive at the company. “I am just starting out in my career, and have been and remain fearful about speaking up,” Ms. O’Connor wrote. “But remaining silent is causing me great distress.”In speaking out about her hotel episode, Ms. Judd said in a recent interview, “Women have been talking about Harvey amongst ourselves for a long time, and it’s simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly.”A Common NarrativeMs. Nestor, a law and business school student, accepted Mr. Weinstein’s breakfast invitation at the Peninsula because she did not want to miss an opportunity, she later told colleagues. After she arrived, he offered to help her career while boasting about a series of famous actresses he claimed to have slept with, according to accounts that colleagues compiled after hearing her story and then sent on to company executives.“She said he was very persistent and focused though she kept saying no for over an hour,” one internal document said. Ms. Nestor, who declined to comment for this article, refused his bargain, the records noted. “She was disappointed that he met with her and did not seem to be interested in her résumé or skill set.” The young woman chose not to report the episode to human resources personnel, but the allegations came to management’s attention through other employees.Across the years and continents, accounts of Mr. Weinstein’s conduct share a common narrative: Women reported to a hotel for what they thought were work reasons, only to discover that Mr. Weinstein, who has been married for most of three decades, sometimes seemed to have different interests. His home base was New York, but his rolling headquarters were luxury hotels: the Peninsula Beverly Hills and the Savoy in London, the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc near the Cannes Film Festival in France and the Stein Eriksen Lodge near the Sundance Film Festival.ImageThe Peninsula Beverly Hills, a hotel where Mr. Weinstein has been accused of sexually harassing women in the entertainment industry.CreditFG/Bauer-Griffin, via Getty ImagesWorking for Mr. Weinstein could mean getting him out of bed in the morning and doing “turndown duty” late at night, preparing him for sleep. Like the colleague cited in Ms. O’Connor’s memo, some junior employees required to perform those tasks said they were disturbing.In interviews, eight women described varying behavior by Mr. Weinstein: appearing nearly or fully naked in front of them, requiring them to be present while he bathed or repeatedly asking for a massage or initiating one himself. The women, typically in their early or middle 20s and hoping to get a toehold in the film industry, said he could switch course quickly — meetings and clipboards one moment, intimate comments the next. One woman advised a peer to wear a parka when summoned for duty as a layer of protection against unwelcome advances.Laura Madden, a former employee who said Mr. Weinstein prodded her for massages at hotels in Dublin and London beginning in 1991, said he had a way of making anyone who objected feel like an outlier. “It was so manipulative,” she said in an interview. “You constantly question yourself — am I the one who is the problem?”Oct. 5, 2017“I don’t know anything about that,” Mr. Weinstein said.Most women who told The Times that they experienced misconduct by Mr. Weinstein had never met one another. They range in age from early 20s to late 40s and live in different cities. Some said they did not report the behavior because there were no witnesses and they feared retaliation by Mr. Weinstein. Others said they felt embarrassed. But most confided in co-workers.Ms. Madden later told Karen Katz, a friend and colleague in the acquisitions department, about Mr. Weinstein’s overtures, including a time she locked herself in the bathroom of his hotel room, sobbing. “We were so young at the time,” said Ms. Katz, now a documentary filmmaker. “We did not understand how wrong it was or how Laura should deal with it.”Others in the London office said the same. “I was pretty disturbed and angry,” said Sallie Hodges, another former employee, recalling the accounts she heard from colleagues. “That’s kind of the way things were.”The human resources operation was considered weak in New York and worse in London, so some employees banded together in solidarity. “If a female executive was asked to go to a meeting solo, she and a colleague would generally double up” so as not to be alone with Mr. Weinstein, recalled Mr. Gill, the former president of Miramax Los Angeles.Many women who worked with Mr. Weinstein said they never experienced sexual harassment or knew of anyone who did, and recalled him as a boss who gave them valuable opportunities at young ages. Some described long and satisfying careers with him, praising him as a mentor and advocate.But in interviews, some of the former employees who said they had troubling experiences with Mr. Weinstein asked a common question: How could allegations repeating the same pattern — young women, a powerful male producer, even some of the same hotels — have accumulated for almost three decades?“It wasn’t a secret to the inner circle,” said Kathy DeClesis, Bob Weinstein’s assistant in the early 1990s. She supervised a young woman who left the company abruptly after an encounter with Harvey Weinstein and who later received a settlement, according to several former employees.Speaking up could have been costly. A job with Mr. Weinstein was a privileged perch at the nexus of money, fame and art, and plenty of his former assistants have risen high in Hollywood. He could be charming and generous: gift baskets, flowers, personal or career help and cash. At the Cannes Film Festival, according to several former colleagues, he sometimes handed out thousands of dollars as impromptu bonuses.Mr. Weinstein was a volcanic personality, though, given to fits of rage and personal lashings of male and female employees alike. When a female guest of his had to wait for a hotel room upgrade, he yelled that Ms. O’Connor would be better off marrying a “fat, rich Jewish” man because she was probably just good for “being a wife” and “making babies,” she wrote in her memo. (He added some expletives, she said.) His treatment of women was sometimes written off as just another form of toxicity, according to multiple former employees.In the fall of 1998, a 25-year-old London assistant named Zelda Perkins confronted Mr. Weinstein. According to former colleagues, she and several co-workers had been regularly subjected to inappropriate requests or comments in hotel rooms, and she was particularly concerned about the treatment of another woman in the office. She told Mr. Weinstein that he had to stop, according to the former colleagues, and that she would go public or initiate legal action unless he changed his behavior.Steve Hutensky, one of Miramax’s entertainment lawyers, was dispatched to London to negotiate a settlement with Ms. Perkins and her lawyer. He declined to comment for this article.Ms. Perkins, now a theater producer in London, also declined to comment for this article, saying that she could not discuss her work at Miramax or whether she had entered into any agreements.Months after the settlement, Mr. Weinstein triumphed at the Oscars, with “ Life Is Beautiful ” and “ Shakespeare in Love ” winning 10 awards. A few years later, Mr. Weinstein, who had produced a series of British-themed movies, was made a Commander of the British Empire, an honorary title just short of knighthood.‘Coercive Bargaining’For actors, a meeting with Mr. Weinstein could yield dazzling rewards: scripts, parts, award campaigns, magazine coverage, influence on lucrative endorsement deals. He knew how to blast small films to box office success, and deliver polished dramas like “The King’s Speech” and popular attractions like the “Scary Movie” franchise. Mr. Weinstein’s films helped define femininity, sex and romance, from Catherine Zeta-Jones in “Chicago” to Jennifer Lawrence in “Silver Linings Playbook.”ImageThe actress Ashley Judd in the 1997 film “Kiss the Girls.” Ms. Judd said that Mr. Weinstein sexually harassed her two decades ago in his room at the Peninsula.CreditParamount Pictures, via PhotofestBut movies were also his private leverage. When Mr. Weinstein invited Ms. Judd to breakfast in Beverly Hills, she had been shooting the thriller “ Kiss the Girls ” all night, but the meeting seemed too important to miss. After arriving at the hotel lobby, she was surprised to learn that they would be talking in his suite; she decided to order cereal, she said, so the food would come quickly and she could leave.Mr. Weinstein soon issued invitation after invitation, she said. Could he give her a massage? When she refused, he suggested a shoulder rub. She rejected that too, she recalled. He steered her toward a closet, asking her to help pick out his clothing for the day, and then toward the bathroom. Would she watch him take a shower? she remembered him saying.“I said no, a lot of ways, a lot of times, and he always came back at me with some new ask,” Ms. Judd said. “It was all this bargaining, this coercive bargaining.”To get out of the room, she said, she quipped that if Mr. Weinstein wanted to touch her, she would first have to win an Oscar in one of his movies. She recalled feeling “panicky, trapped,” she said in the interview. “There’s a lot on the line, the cachet that came with Miramax.”Not long afterward, she related what had happened to her mother, the singer Naomi Judd, who confirmed their conversation to a Times reporter. Years later, Ashley Judd appeared in two Weinstein films without incident, she said. In 2015, she shared an account of the episode in the hotel room with “ Variety ” without naming the man involved.ImageIn 1997, Mr. Weinstein reached a settlement with the actor Rose McGowan after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. She had just appeared in the movie “Scream,” above.CreditDimension Films, via PhotofestIn 1997, Mr. Weinstein reached a previously undisclosed settlement with Rose McGowan, then a 23-year-old-actress, after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. The $100,000 settlement was “not to be construed as an admission” by Mr. Weinstein, but intended to “avoid litigation and buy peace,” according to the legal document, which was reviewed by The Times. Ms. McGowan had just appeared in the slasher film “ Scream ” and would later star in the television show “Charmed.” She declined to comment.Increased ScrutinyJust months before Ms. O’Connor wrote her memo, a young female employee quit after complaining of being forced to arrange what she believed to be assignations for Mr. Weinstein, according to two people familiar with her departure. The woman, who asked not to be identified to protect her privacy, said a nondisclosure agreement prevented her from commenting.Soon, complaints about Mr. Weinstein’s behavior prompted the board of his company to take notice.In March 2015, Mr. Weinstein had invited Ambra Battilana, an Italian model and aspiring actress, to his TriBeCa office on a Friday evening to discuss her career. Within hours, she called the police. Ms. Battilana told them that Mr. Weinstein had grabbed her breasts after asking if they were real and put his hands up her skirt, the police report says.The claims were taken up by the New York Police Department’s Special Victims Squad and splashed across the pages of tabloids, along with reports that the woman had worked with investigators to secretly record a confession from Mr. Weinstein. The Manhattan district attorney’s office later declined to bring charges.But Mr. Weinstein made a payment to Ms. Battilana, according to people familiar with the settlement, speaking on the condition of anonymity about the confidential agreement.The public nature of the episode concerned some executives and board members of the Weinstein Company. (Harvey and Bob Weinstein together own 42 percent of the privately held business.) When several board members pressed Mr. Weinstein about it, he insisted that the woman had set him up, colleagues recalled.Ms. Battilana had testified in court proceedings against associates of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy who are accused of procuring women for alleged sex parties, and the Italian news media also reported that, years ago, Ms. Battilana accused a septuagenarian boyfriend of sexual harassment, a complaint that was apparently dismissed. Ms. Battilana did not respond to requests for comment. Her lawyer, Mauro Rufini, could not be reached for comment.After the episode, Lance Maerov, a board member, said he successfully pushed for a code of behavior for the company that included detailed language about sexual harassment.Then Ms. O’Connor’s memo hit, with page after page of detailed accusations. In describing the experiences of women at the company, including her own, she wrote, “The balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10.”She was a valued employee — Mr. Weinstein described her as “fantastic,” “a great person,” “a brilliant executive” — so the complaint rattled top executives, including Bob Weinstein. When the board was notified of it by email, Mr. Maerov insisted that an outside lawyer determine whether the allegations were true, he said in an interview.ImageMr. Weinstein in 1999 with the winners of the best-picture Oscar for “Shakespeare in Love.”CreditHector Mata/Agence France—PresseBut the inquiry never happened. Mr. Weinstein had reached a settlement with Ms. O’Connor, and there was no longer anything to investigate.“Because this matter has been resolved and no further action is required, I withdraw my complaint,” Ms. O’Connor wrote in an email to the head of human resources six days after sending her memo. She also wrote a letter to Mr. Weinstein thanking him for the opportunity to learn about the entertainment industry.Rachel Abrams and William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting.

Use of Bluetooth-equipped devices has stretched across the globe, yet the technologys origins and name can be traced to an engineer obsessed with making computers function using as little energy as possible.Power is one of the key attributes. Battery life is life. Its the life of the product. To ignore that is totally unacceptable. You have to design things to work efficiently, but more importantly, do nothing efficiently, said Jim Kardach, retired chief power architect at Intel.Originally intended as a wireless replacement for cables to connect phones, headsets, computers, keyboards and mice, Bluetooth technology has proliferated over the past decade, allowing devices in close proximity to connect while using very little battery power.The headsets are ubiquitous, but according to the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) they are only one of many product types that make up the 9 billion Bluetooth devices in the world today. That number keeps growing. Over the next 2 years, annual Bluetooth device shipments are expected to double from 2 to 4 billion, according to ABI Research.Intel mobile computing engineer Jim Kardach was instrumental in bringing together Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Nokia and Toshiba to form the Bluetooth SIG in 1998. That group created the universal standard that is used by more than 17,000 member companies.Kardach recalls playing the role of instigator and mediator among the founding companies, but says the group quickly agreed on a common goal to create a small, low-power consuming, low-cost, short-range radio with built-in security and the ability to connect ad hoc with other devices. Inspired by a book about Vikings that he was reading at the time, he came up with the Bluetooth name.Just days before he retired in December, Kardach reflected on his 27-year career at Intel, including the genesis of Bluetooth, the many low-power design breakthroughs that led to 100 patents and his work on the first notebook system-on-chip (SoC) sold in the 1980s by Intel called the 386SL/486SL.How did you get involved with the creation of Bluetooth?I got the assignment in 1997 when my boss at the time came up to me and said, Youre finishing up the ACPI stuff, can you figure out how to integrate wireless into the notebook?We got together Ericsson, Nokia, Toshiba and IBM. That probably represented 60 percent of both the cellphone and notebook markets at the time. The key was to define the goals of what we wanted to do. We formed a SIG, all agreeing that we wanted to build this universal, very low-cost, private, wireless cable.We did it under an open IP (intellectual property) policy, allowing us to take the best pieces from everywhere and put them together. We had goals on what we wanted this thing to cost and strategies for it being built on a bulk CMOS process, which hadnt been done before. It had security, privacy and had to work across the world, so we picked the ISM band, which required fixing some of the regulatory issues around it. We had a term sheet that everyone agreed to and we put it together. Intel became the leader simply because we had IBM and Toshiba who didnt trust each other, and Ericsson and Nokia who didnt trust each other, so we were kind of the Switzerland.How does a chief power architect look at things?The idea for the Bluetooth name came from Jim Kardach of Intel, who was reading a historical novel about Vikings and King Harald Bluetooth at the time.Power is one of the key attributes. Battery life is life. Its the life of the product. To ignore that is totally unacceptable. You have to design things to work efficiently, but more importantly, do nothing efficiently. Those are the two rules of power management.We rely on architectural designs to lower power use. We design chips to turn things off and back on only when theyre needed. We architect things to minimize latency and anticipate when something is needed so it gets turned on just in time.We used to rely on randomness, like when you drive to work and hope to miss all of the red lights, but more recently weve purposely tried to line up activities in order to create big idle gaps between these activities. If the idle gaps are long enough, we can shut off all of the power. For example, we now have special offloading accelerators that run to do specialized media loads and then be able to put the rest of the platform to a low-power state, which means 98 percent of it is powered off.Hardware not designed for power management can be like crying babies that wake up the whole house. They ping memory every couple of milliseconds or microseconds, keeping the CPU out of its low-power state. This can keep memory and the busses between them alive. A Bluetooth radio should require about a milliwatt of power, but when you put it on a USB plug, because of the way the bus was architected, it generates an extra 6 watts of power by pinging memory every millisecond. These are things we want to catch up front when architecting for good power management.The fourth-generation Intel Core processors that use an SoC design are coming out soon. Whats the advantage of SoCs over traditional CPU designs?SoC allows you to do things that arent possible if you have a handful of chips from different venders. We have the advantage of doing our own chipsets and CPUs, which allows us to design power management between them and the rest of the platform.In the 1980s I worked on the 3SL and 4SL SoCs. We were doing it in an era where we were cramming hundreds of thousands of transistors on a die and now we can fit billions. We can now take advantage of Moores Law and increased capacity that were getting from bigger wafers and smaller transistors. This lets us integrate more capabilities into a small chip. Having an SoC allows us to bring power management across the platform.With the 3SL, we added new operating modes to the CPU that pulled some power management underneath the operating system. This work is still used today. To design an SoC, sometimes you have to trade off time to market but you can really take advantage of them to manage power consumption.This content was originally published on the Intel Free Press website.'	1

https://www.snopes.com/media/notnews/strapon.asp	Was a Florida Teacher Suspended After a Shocking Sex Ed Demonstration?	false	['common core', ' infowars', ' national report', ' not necessarily the news']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/Zhdna	2017/09/03	6th Graders Taught How to Use Strap-On DildoExplicit: 11-12 year olds given sex toy lesson in Jacksonvilleby Paul Joseph Watson | September 15, 20149,23530931Shocking images out of a classroom in Jacksonville, Florida illustrate how 11-12 year olds in 6th grade are being taught how to use strap-on dildos amidst a debate about sexual content finding its way into other Common Core subjects, material which has been attacked by some as pornographic.The pictures were taken by a student with a cellphone camera. They show a teacher demonstrating how to use a strap-on sex toy in a number of different positions.In one image, the teacher even shows how to insert the strap-on while her buttocks are in the air and her legs up over her head.In another image, the woman shows the children how to wear a harness to which the strap-on is attached.Clinton Middle School in Duval County hired 39-year-old Sharon Mercer to teach the sex education class but after the photos emerged she was suspended and the school refused further comment. Mercer claimed her suspension was an act of “bigotry” because she was a “proud member of the LGBTQ community.”Newly implemented Common Core educational standards have been assailed for their attempt to create a lowest common denominator form of teaching which many assert only works to dumb down lessons and prevent smart students from excelling.The teaching of so-called “alternative” sexual lifestyles is being practiced in many states under Common Core as a result of sexual content finding its way into other subjects. A school district in Arizona banned a Common Core-approved book last year after it was found to contain sexually explicit passages that described scenes of bondage.Common Core, which is being federally imposed on states across the nation, is a huge shift in teaching which opponents assert will eviscerate critical thinking and generally lower standards in the name of inclusiveness and political correctness. Numerous examples have emerged of Common Core style exam questions which only serve to cause more confusion and frustration.Perhaps the most infamous example of how Common Core will manifest itself in America’s schooling system was illustrated by a bizarre video in which a Common Core curriculum director said that 3 x 4 = 11 could be considered a correct answer so long as students could explain how they reached that number.Common Core’s sex education content has also faced fierce criticism, with one group even claiming that it represents “pornography” which serves to desensitize children to sexual contact and could lead to an increased chance of molestation within the schooling system.Common Core approved book aimed at 11th graders contains sexually explicit scenes of bondage.“What is taught includes teaching inappropriate sexuality skills, that shouldn’t even be taught in college,” writes Joseph R. John . “According to child psychologists, the children are not mentally equipped to understand the detailed sexual indoctrination starting in kindergarten, they are indoctrinated in sexual practices that they should never be exposed to.”“There is a heavy socio political content of sex throughout Common Core curriculum being taught in every grade and in every subject, the student is taught that there is a sameness of gender, there is no longer simply boys and girls according to Common Core,” notes John. “The sexual content of Common Core crosses into every curriculum taught, from teaching sexuality skills in sex education courses by specially skilled and trained sex education teachers. Sexual activities and content in included in every subject taught. Sex is taught in the English curriculum, is included in the language curriculum, sex is woven into the science curriculum, in the math curriculum, in the social studies curriculum, and of course in biology.”As the backlash grows, more and more states are considering abolishing Common Core altogether, with Indiana’s decision earlier this year to ditch the program seen as a victory for conservatives.FOLLOW Paul Joseph Watson @ https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet*********************Paul Joseph Watson is the editor at large of Infowars.com and Prison Planet.com .  Print this page.	1

The area is known to be the home of several gators, although there have been few cases of anyone receiving serious injuries from gator attacks in the area. That said, approaching a wild gator to take a photo is definitely not recommended.“I’ve lived in Pensacola all my life,” said one witness, who was walking her dogs along the trail, “but never have I seen anyone take such a big risk, and for so little.” According to the witness, the New Zealand tourist, who is yet to be formally named, deviated from the trail despite being warned by several locals that the gator may attack. “She risked her life to take a photo with a gator? It’s madness, why would you do a thing like that?”Numerous onlookers were horrified as the woman approached a gator that was resting on the edge of the trail in a patch of sun. “I pleaded with her to get back onto the trail,” said one male witness, “but she said she was just going to take a selfie and told me not to worry about it.” The woman proceeded to take out her phone and prepare for the selfie, but moments later the alligator lashed out, covering the distance between itself and the tourist in seconds.Related Articles23 Women Inappropriately Dressed For Walmart?These content links are provided by Content.ad .

We saw the gator grab her between his jaws, and there was a sharp cry as he dragged her into the bushes, and then just a strange stillness.” The authorities were summoned almost immediately but nothing could be done. “A few hours later we found a purse which we believe belonged to the victim, but no sign of her body has been found.”The identity of the New Zealand woman who perished in the attack has not yet been revealed, although it is believed she was visiting relatives in Pensacola. Authorities have reminded tourists to the region to not take any risks and be aware of the dangers posed by alligators. “For some visitors who are unfamiliar with the strength and speed of these animals, they may be complacent and not appreciate how dangerous they can be. We want to urge tourists to take precautions, and don’t risk your life over getting a photo with an alligator, as it might just kill you.”In other news making headlines, a 29-year old Alabama woman has been hailed as a hero after she was able to fight off a man during an attempted rape. However, her story has sparked some controversy after it emerged that she cut off the rapist's genitals and forced him to eat them.Popular Stories"	1

His decision comes after a shooting at a high school in nearby Parkland, Fla. left 17 dead and others injured.Courtesy of Ben DickmannBen Dickmann has been hunting since he was a child. The 40-year-old Florida man enjoyed going out on the gun range to practice firing at targets and was the proud owner of an AR-57, a semi-automatic rifle.But, after 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School by a former student using a semi-automatic rifle, Dickmann, who lives just over 30 minutes away in Fort Lauderdale, did something unexpected.Dickmann turned in his AR-57 to the sheriff's office and asked them to destroy it. He posted about it on Facebook, and that post has now gone viral. It's been shared more than 100,000 times.Dickmann spoke to NPR's Michel Martin about his love of the firearm and why he decided to give it up.Interview HighlightsOn the decision to turn in his AR-57It's come after a lot of soul searching. Everybody always says - you know, it's the big argument right now - everybody's offering thoughts and prayers but nothing else. And I thought, well, this is something I can do that I think is right. And it's something I can do that might spark a change. You know, my whole goal was maybe to inspire one friend on my Facebook page to do the same thing. And maybe that friend would inspire one other person. And who knows? I totally didn't expect for this to go the way it did and as fast as it did.On the issue of obtaining a concealed carry/weapon permitThe concealed weapons permit program here in the state of Florida, as far as I'm concerned, is a joke. Literally, it's three hours of PowerPoint, and then you go down to the range with a very, very low caliber handgun, and you have to put five out of 10 rounds on a paper plate at 5 feet. Probably half the class that I had are people that had never touched a gun before in their life.On the challenge to give up his AR-57After Las Vegas, I had thought long and hard about it, and thought, well, you know, it's not hurting anything sitting in my gun safe here. But it wasn't really until this last tragedy at Stoneman Douglas where it really hit home with us - and me.Actually, one of my friends on Facebook rather sarcastically said, well, if you really feel this way, why don't you go turn in your gun at Broward Sheriff's Office? I'll even drive you. And that's what spurred me to think. Even though he was being extremely sarcastic about it because he's a very staunch conservative, gun rights activist person, it kind of spurred me to say, you know what? Yeah, I'll do that.On what he plans to do nextFor me, to be honest, I'm not sure. It's a lot to process, and nothing that I had this grand master plan going into this for. So I'm happy that this sparked a debate and hopefully causes some action. I hope somebody - be it the students, be it the next generation - picks up the torch and does something.NPR's Digital News intern Asia Simone Burns produced this story for the Web.

https://www.snopes.com/amelia-bassano-william-shakespeare/	Amelia Bassano: The True Shakespeare?	false	['amelia bassano', ' bassano', ' literature', ' sonnets', ' william shakespeare', ' william shakespeare plays']	http://njjewishnews.com/	http://njjewishnews.com/njjn.com/022808/ltKosherBard.html	2015/08/20	Special to the NJJNFebruary 28, 2008John Hudson is a man with a mission. Seven years ago, the 54-year-old social theorist embarked on a literary adventure, following a long-nursed hunch about Shakespeare’s true identity.Hudson had spent most of his adult life grappling with complex questions that straddled the fields of social theory and cognitive science, creating high-level strategic redesign for the energy, telecommunications, Internet, and public sectors.“Most of my work involved helping media companies rethink their industries,” says Hudson. “Now I’ve moved on to rethinking the Shakespearean industry.” With his life and plays comprising a billion-dollar global industry, says Hudson, the Bard has managed to secure a sublime place in literary history as well as an omnipresence in pop culture and media. “But, like all industries, it rests on certain assumptions,” says Hudson. It is these very assumptions — primarily about who the author of the plays really was — that Hudson set about to reinvent.Hudson had an uneasy feeling that there was more beneath the plays’ surface than was brought to light by scholars and historians. His search began in earnest after he enrolled in a postgraduate program at the Shakespeare Institute at the University of Birmingham — in Stratford-upon-Avon, naturally — where he spent four years delving into the texts.He gradually devised the latest approach to Shakespearean authorship, the Amelia Bassano Theory — recently recognized by the Shakespearean Authorship Trust as one of the top eight authorship theories.The figure of Amelia Bassano Lanyer had turned up before in Shakespearean scholarship. In 1973, celebrated historian A.L. Rowse identified her as the actual “Dark Lady” of Shakespeare’s famed sonnets. Bassano — known as the first woman in England to have published a book of original poetry (Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum, 1611), which has been interpreted as an early feminist critique of the Christian Gospels — was part of a family of Italian court musicians of Moroccan/Semitic ancestry who lived as clandestine Jews.Hudson explains that the unusual circumstances of Amelia’s upbringing accounted for her extraordinary education and literary sensitivity. By age seven, she was adopted by the Countess of Kent, who provided her with a well-rounded education, including studies in Greek, Latin, and the Bible. By 13, she became mistress to Lord Henry Hunsdon, the man in charge of the English theater and patron of the Lord Chamberlain’s Men — the company that performed Shakespeare’s works.The plays certainly suggest that their author had access to scholarly training as well as exposure to certain specific environments — all of which coincide with Amelia’s biography. The 2,000 musical references, for example, were her birthright; the hundreds of references to plants, law, military life, and falconry could likely be the result of her involvement with Hunsdon. Other subject matter in the plays echoes her childhood experiences.But most important, Hudson discovered her key “literary signatures” — in which Amelia left her name spread across various plays. Her married name Lanier — meaning falcon in French — is spread across the two different versions of The Taming of the Shrew. It is in the form of the central figure who is tamed like a falcon, together with her name Emila; her father’s name, Baptista, and her husband’s name, Alphonso. An Emillius and a Bassianus appear in Titus Andronicus as well. But the most important “signatures” are those created after her husband’s death, between 1622-23, when her full maiden name — Aemilia Johnson Willough(by) Bassanio — was spread across three Shakespearean plays, associated in each case with the standard image of the Renaissance poet. Such a circumstance had little chance of being a mere coincidence. “She so badly wanted us to notice them,” says Hudson, “but nobody ever did.”Something revolutionaryThe next step for Hudson was to bring his case to the theater-going public. The first play he selected as a vehicle for his theory was A Midsummer Night’s Dream; with its staging he intended to present the allegorical plot revealing the key subtextual layers indicative of Bassano’s Jewish authorship. The challenge was to find the right people to do the job and convince them that he was on to something revolutionary.Hudson is British, married to an American, and the couple often shuttles between London and New York. It was there, in the fall of 2006, that he set out to put together a theater group that had both the dramatic training and mental muscle to actualize his theories. After a few months, Hudson had on board Mahayana Landowne, a Yale Drama School-educated director. Next he enrolled in a “Shakespeare Boot Camp” workshop at the New Perspectives Theatre Company, where he befriended Jenny Greeman, an experienced actress and theater educator who was to become his assistant director. “I found his theory compelling,” said Greeman, “and the figure of Amelia Bassano is absolutely fascinating…. She is someone who needs to be spoken about much more. I am thoroughly ready to believe that she could have written these plays….”Translating Hudson’s esoteric theory into concepts and then into practice involved hours of improvisation between actors, directors, and dramaturge (Hudson’s official title). “I was happy to adopt a hands-off management style when it came to staging the plays and leave it to those who truly understood the physicality of the theater,” he said. Yet, when it came to selecting actors for his new troupe, The Dark Lady Players, he made a point of meeting extensively with each actor to ensure that they were willing to think about the plays allegorically and took a proactive role at the dramatic workshops.Lila Dupree, who played Theseus, feels that the DLP achieved a group dynamic unlike any she had experienced before. “It is definitely a struggle at times to condense things so that they will be visually clear and clean. With something this high-concept, you risk alienating the audience, so a lot of our process involves finding ways to break down that fourth wall, so to speak.”Dupree is one of about 15 actors in the troupe, representing an eclectic ‘melting pot’ of theatrical backgrounds. What they all share is Shakespearean training buttressed by a voracious appetite for intellectually rigorous work.The DLP is now testing its version of As You Like It in workshops. Also in the pipeline is Hudson’s biography of Amelia Bassano, as well as a documentary film deal. With all the exciting attention on the horizon, the troupe feels wholly committed to its mission of presenting new and thought-provoking interpretations of Shakespeare’s (or Bassano’s) plays. “We’ve learned a lot from our experience with Midsummer,” says Dupree, “and with As You Like It, we are ready to take it to the next level.”To order a DVD of the Dark Lady Players’ Midsummer Night’s Dream, e-mail Dark Lady Players .Daniela Amini is a New York-based freelance writer specializing in theater, opera, dance, and local news.Comedy as revengeIn staging Midsummer Night’s Dream, John Hudson’s objective was, first and foremost, to reveal the play as a Jewish satire rife with pointed references to Christian idolatry. In other words, “comedy as revenge.”John Hudson carried out a literary adventure and brought it to the stage.In his findings, each character is revealed to have a connection with a character in religious allegory, i.e., a “double” in the Roman/Christian world. Stanford University professor Patricia Parker had already shown that Puck carries the name of two devils, that Bottom represents Jesus (and, in the course of the play, undergoes a kind of “Passion”), and that Thisbe represents the Church. Hudson completed the puzzle to show that Oberon is the figure of Yahweh (God of the Jews), who is embroiled in the Jewish-Roman war against Titus Caesar (embodied by Titania) over the abduction of the true Jewish Messiah (the Iudean or ‘Indian’ boy); the “flower, love in idleness” (a pun on idolatry), represents the Gospels; and the end of the play is a Jewish apocalypse characterized by the distribution of dew — as in the Zohar.The Dark Lady Players debuted Midsummer Night’s Dream in March 2007 at the Abingdon Theatre Arts Complex near Times Square. The staging was never heavy-handed and there were some uproariously funny moments, punctuated by scenes of violent carnage and deep, spiritual pathos. The overall tone was of a promising marriage between strict comedy and strict tragedy.— DANIELA AMINIDark Lady eventsFrom the Dark Lady Players’ A Midsummer Night’s Dream: A Comic Jewish Satire, Kirsta Peterson, top, as Bottom/Pyramus and Megan McGrath, left, and Amanda Bruton as soldiers.

https://www.snopes.com/disney/parks/club33.asp	Questions About Disneyland’s Club 33, Answered	true	['club 33', ' disney lawsuits', ' disney parks', ' disney rumors', ' disneyland', ' theme parks']	http://www.disneytouristblog.com/	http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disneyland-bar-crawl-guide/	2007/08/27	Pin ItAlthough no alcohol is sold in Disneyland itself (except in Club 33), locations in Disney California Adventure, the Disney-owned hotels, and Downtown Disney serve alcohol. Here’s our guide to the best beer and mixed drinks available throughout Disneyland Resort.While it’s not as popular as Drinking Around the World at Epcot in Walt Disney World, leisurely afternoon spent exploring the various Disneyland Resort bars is a lot of fun. Plus, all of these bars are within a short walk of one another given Disneyland’s condensed footprint, so it’s easy to hit them all in one day.Some of the mixed drinks here might be off-menu at some locations, but they’re listed because the bartenders at the given location do a great job with these drinks. We try to give a couple suggestions for each location so that you don’t have to order a random drink off what I “lovingly” prefer to as the Generic DisneyParks® Drink Menu® .I loathe this menu of sugar-water and vibrantly color concoctions meant to appeal only to vacationers who don’t regularly drink. It is the epitome of what is wrong with the contemporary Disney theme parks: homogenization that has replaced unique experiences in the name of saving a few bucks because bean-counters either don’t understand the “Disney Difference,” or think most guests won’t notice, anyway. More importantly, if you’re someone who has the mental and physical fortitude to partake in a bar crawl, you will be largely unimpressed by these drinks. Plus, consuming more than a couple will make you sick to your stomach from an overdose of sugar.Because of this, we make recommendations that are either unique to each specific stop on our tour, or are drinks most bartenders at the locations in question know how to make. Order these, or order something else you enjoy that the bartender knows how to make. You order drinks off the Generic DisneyParks® Drink Menu® at your own peril.Obviously you should use your head when consuming alcohol. Eat a big early-lunch before you start, make sure to stay hydrated, and spread out your drinking. This is enough fun that it should be an all day event, so take your time. We recommend starting at around noon and concluding late in the evening.Every good bar crawl needs a good name, and we’re fresh out. Epcot has “Drinking Around the World,” which is a very solid name, but nothing spectacular for Disneyland sticks out like that. In lieu of something better, I’m going to call this the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery. Sounds a little more risque than it actually is, but I like alliterations.It’s scientifically proven that the best place to start the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery is in Disney California Adventure. Laugh if you want, but there is a very good reason for this: Disney California Adventure has some attractions that are enhanced with alcohol. Seriously, it’s like adding 3D to the Lion King. It started out great, but 3D really adds an element of “wow.”These alcohol-enhanced attractions are California Screamin’, Silly Symphony Swings, Goofy’s Sky School, and the Golden Zephyr. In other words, the stuff on Paradise Pier. “Science” is needed here because you need to consume the perfect amount of alcohol to enhance these experiences. Drink too little, and they’re the same as they normally are. Drink too much, and it’s Upchuck-City. Population: everyone in your general vicinity. Not a pretty picture. However, if you hit that slightly-buzzed sweet spot, these attractions are a lot more fun.Okay, let’s get started with the fun!Disney California AdventureCarthay Circle Lounge – Part of the all-new Buena Vista Street, Carthay Circle contains a restaurant and two lounges. The first lounge, 1901, is available only to “upgraded” Club 33 members.  The other lounge is where you’ll be stopping, and there’s no reason to be down about this if you’re not a Club 33 member (as is the case with 99.99999999999999999% of the population), because this lounge is spectacular.The decor is classy and elegant, and most importantly, the lounge has its own unique menu. There are several great options on this menu, with different types of custom ice (seriously) to boot! My personal favorite is the Carthay Manhattan. Sarah enjoys the Carthay Club Mojito. The Aviator Cocktail is a good, strong drink, too. Be careful when you step into Carthay Circle Lounge, as this could be the first and last stop on your Disneyland Debauchery Drinking tour. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as the drinks here are seriously good.Al Fresco Tasting Terrace – This location can be difficult to find. It’s a secluded area upstairs from Wine Country Trattoria. If you can’t find the staircase leading here, ask a Cast Member. It’s easier to find than it used to be, since changing over from the Al Fresco Lounge to the Tasting Terrace. Now featuring more tasting plates and a robust drink menu, things have improved, as you can read in our Al Fresco Tasting Terrace Review .Moreover, the views from this terrace into Cars Land are phenomenal. Here, we recommend one of the cheaper wine flights or the Widmer Hefeweizen . This is a wine bar, so I’d caution against straying from wines and beers. We’ve never had a good mixed drink here. In fact, the Irish Coffee Sarah once ordered here was about the most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted, and was nothing like a traditional Irish Coffee. Fortunately, Al Fresco Tasting Terrace has come a long way since then, and it’s now one of our favorite spots in DCA.Bayside Brews – Bayside Brews is located near the Silly Symphony Swings, Golden Zephyr, and Goofy’s Sky School. Unsurprisingly, it serves beer. Although it’s just a little stand (if we stopped at every little beer kiosk in DCA, you’d end up in the hospital–fear not, this is one of only two that we hit), it is notable because it serves good beer as compared to other beer stands in Disneyland. We recommend grabbing a Sierra Nevada Torpedo IPA or whatever the Karl Strauss seasonal beer happens to be. The Torpedo IPA is definitely your best bet, and possibly the best beer you can find at Disneyland Resort.We highly recommend grabbing your brew from Bayside Brews, and then heading over to the actual bayside, to the secluded seating area under Silly Symphony Swings. Enjoy your beer there in peace while looking out over the water, and then head upstairs for the ride of your life on the swings!Cove Bar – The next stop is Cove Bar. Ahh, Cove Bar. In the original version of this Drinking Guide that we published in 2012, we regaled readers with tales of Cove Bar and its glorious Lobster Nachos. Prior to that post, we never had to wait to be seated at Cove Bar, always walking up and having our choice of seats.Shortly after that post, Cove Bar exploded in popularity. Now, we aren’t taking credit for that…nor are we taking blame. Irrespective of the reason, Cove Bar exploded in popularity, and a contributing factor was undoubtedly viral images of Lobster Nachos and colorful drinks on Instagram and Pinterest.Cove Bar began drawing lines rivaling those of Radiator Springs Races. The Lobster Nacho Revolution had begun. Fortunately, in early 2016, Disney opened an expanded seating area for Cove Bar, and now the waits have been reduced to more manageable times on most days (10-20 minutes).The bartenders are usually very entertaining and fun at the Cove Bar, so sitting at the bar can also be a good time. This should be your second food stop of the day (you should’ve eaten lunch before commencing the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery) and there is one thing you should absolutely order here: the Lobster Nachos. As we wrote in our Cove Bar Review , the Lobster Nachos are “a zen-like experience that makes you feel like there are little angels massaging your taste buds and tickling your stomach…a religious experience.”These are the most expensive thing on the bar menu, but they are so, so delicious. My drink of choice here is the Zombie , which can be made a few different ways. The bartenders here usually make it a dark green color, but don’t be surprised if it’s light. It does have some fruit juices in it, but it also is heavy on the rum (light, dark, and 151).The Cove Bar also has around 10 beers on tap, so pick one of those if you’re not down with the undead concoction.***Intermission***During the intermission, enjoy the Golden Zephyr, Silly Symphony Swings, and, if your stomach can handle it, California Screamin’ and Goofy’s Sky School. Return to the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery after enjoying these attractions.***Intermission***The Karl Strauss Beer Truck – This beer truck tucked away in Pacific Wharf at Disney California Adventure is our second of two kiosk style stops. As the name suggests, this truck serves Karl Strauss beer. As Disneyland Resort, for some reason, is very lacking on good craft beers, we recommend making a stop here. This should not be read as an endorsement of Karl Strauss beer, but comparatively speaking, it is fairly good. Tower 10 IPA and Red Trolley Ale are both good, or go for the seasonal option. This is one step we’d recommend skipping if you want to drink less and/or don’t care for beer. Alternatively, you can also stop at the nearby Rita’s Baja Blenders, Cocina Cucamonga, or Lucky Fortune Cookie for different options.Flo’s V8 Cafe – The latest addition to our list is quite possibly the best stop of all. If you’ve paced things really slowly, you might be here around sunset. That’s the perfect time to drink at Flo’s! Grab a Racer 5 IPA and head back to the outdoor seating area at the back of the restaurant. Here, you have a perfect view of the Cadillac Mountain Range and Radiator Springs Racers. There’s nothing quite like an early evening enjoying a beer and watching the cars fly by one of Imagineering’s masterpieces. You might just find yourself ending your debauchery here, as you get “stuck” at this spot for a couple of hours. Make no mistake–even though you’re not missing the mission, this is a noble feat.On your way to the next stops at Disney’s Grand Californian Hotel & Spa, pick up FastPasses for (hopefully) the late show of World of Color.Grand CalifornianHearthstone Lounge – Hearthstone Lounge has a pretty good selection of beers, with a lot of the standard choices available elsewhere from Karl Strauss and Sierra Nevada. You can also find some choices from Sam Adams and New Castle, among others, here. Here, we definitely recommend sitting at the bar or at least ordering from the bar. We’ve had inexperienced servers here in the general seating area who simply recommend “any of the good drinks on the menu” with the menu being the Generic DisneyParks® Drink Menu®. I typically opt for a Sierra Nevada here, whereas Sarah usually experiments with whatever “bartender’s choice.” These drinks have always tasted great, but beware, they can pack a punch!Napa Rose – Napa Rose is the best non-club restaurant at Disneyland Resort . It also has a pretty nice bar. Luckily, you don’t have to drop $50 on some filet to grab a beer here (although if you see or smell one, you might find yourself doing just that). I recommend the Franziskaner Hefe-Weisses here. It’s creamy and moderately thick, with a nutty flavor and slight banana undertone to it. Napa Rose is more well known for its world class wine collection, so if you’re into wine, you might go that route. Rather than taking my advice on that, ask the bartender or a server. All of the servers here are sommeliers, meaning they know a heck of a lot more about wine than me!Here, the plan offers some wild-card options. See the below “Other Stops” section if you have time in your crawl and want to make an additional stop.Hollywood Land Dance Party [Insert Name] Club – There is a drink station set-up each night for Mad T Party. It was previously End of Line Club, now it’s “Drink Me.” Who knows what it will be next. Regardless of the name, the idea remains the same: pricey light up drinks for clubin’. While the drinks are fairly expensive (over $10 for the light-up specialties) here to capitalize on the party-oriented audience, ours have always been surprisingly good. This is surprising because, given the location and target, we figured these would be watered-down sugar-drinks. The Glowjito Mojito and Digitini Martini are both good and offer light-up fun. To be fair, they are somewhat sugar-y, but the ones we’ve had (on several different nights) have always had some kick. I don’t know if this is just great luck or if it’s always this way. After grabbing a drink, join the other programs…or…tweedle dums(?) at elecTRONica or Mad T Party . Once the dance party concludes, use your FastPass for the late show of World of Color.Trader Sam’s – Enchanted Tiki Bar – After World of Color, the perfect way to cap off the evening is at the best bar in all of Disneyland Resort, Trader Sam’s. If you want a thorough review of Trader Sam’s, read this review where I offer heaping amounts of praise to Trader Sam’s . The CliffNotes version: Trader Sam’s is the coolest bar in Disneyland, with an intimate (47 person capacity) location that is packed with an astonishing amount of detail, interactive elements, and some fantastic drinks.Some of these drinks include the Adventurers Club Kungaloosh (a Walt Disney World classic), the HippopotoMai-Tai, Shrunken Zombie Head, Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Rum, Shipwreck on the Rocks, and the Uh Oa! The Uh Oa! can be shared by 2-4 people, has a cool tableside presentation, and is our favorite drink at Trader Sam’s. Trader Sam’s does serve some good beers as well, but this is one location where you should stick to mixed drinks because they’re really that good. If you stay for only one drink, you can add items in from the “Other Stops” list below, but we recommend spending a couple hours here soaking up the ambiance and ending your night here. It’s the perfect conclusion to Disneyland Drinking Debauchery.Other Stops – There are other places you can stop, but chances are, even with taking it slow and spreading out the festivities over the course of the entire day, eight stops will be the limit (or even too much) for most people. The stops above are our picks for the best drinking spots in Disneyland. However, since we heavily weigh ambiance, there might be some additional or alternative places that might appeal more to you personally, depending upon your preferences. Here’s our list of the best of the rest:	1
https://www.snopes.com/did-a-new-jersey-town-forbid-residents-from-criticizing-islam/	Did a New Jersey Town Forbid Residents From Criticizing Islam?	mfalse	['islamophobia', ' mosque', ' new jersey', ' sharia']	http://americannews.com/	http://americannews.com/us-town-forbids-citizens-criticizing-islam-muslims-residents-furious/	2017/08/08	ago 10According to reports from World Net Daily, a New Jersey township that was sued by a group of Muslims for refusing to approve a massive mosque project is now returning to court because of a settlement agreement that restricts anyone from commenting on “Islam” or “Muslims.”It’s important to note that a key tenet of Shariah bans any negative comments about the religion. According to the Thomas More Law Center who sued the township on behalf of two residents whose home is within 200 feet of the proposed mega-mosque, the settlement “reads more like an instrument of surrender.”The Islamic Society of Basking Ridge won a decision in federal court after its mosque proposal was rejected based on traffic and other concerns. The Township agreed on a $3.5. million payment and a “public hearing to approve the settlement.”Residents Christopher and Loretta Quick challenged the agreement, arguing it restricts speech and violates the Establishment Clause.“The Quicks reside within 200 feet of the proposed mosque construction in a zoned residential area,” Thomas More explained. “Yet, the settlement agreement prohibits them from describing the many unique features of Islamic worship which will impact the design of the building, traffic density, water and sewage, traffic control problems, road construction, and parking arrangements. According to the settlement agreement, ISBR is permitted to make statements concerning Christians and Jews and their places of worship, but in contrast, the agreement prohibits commentary relating to Islam or Muslims. In fact, ISBR has previously discussed the Christian and Jewish religions and their places of worship.”Richard Thompson, chief counsel for Thomas More, said the Islamic center “has taken the extraordinary step of concealing significant links on their website to a radical group named by the federal government as an unindicted co-conspirator in the largest terrorism financing trial in America history, the Islamic Society of North America (‘ISNA’).”Thompson said that while “claiming that the township had a religious animus against Muslims, ISBR hid from the public view its animus toward Christians and Jews, by not only hiding anti-Christian and anti-Semitic verses published on its website but also hiding its significant ties to ISNA. Instead of standing up to defend its citizens against ISBR’s hate-filled anti-Semitic and anti-Christian bias, the township colluded with ISBR’s ‘Civilization Jihad’ by capitulating to payment of millions of dollars to ISBR, allowing the construction of the new mosque and Islamic center in violation“ISBR is setting a dangerous unconstitutional precedent by abusing a court process to chill and trample on the First Amendment rights of private citizens whose only involvement was to speak out against the mosque at public hearings,” Thompson said earlier this year.He asked for the subpoenas to be thrown out “because the U.S. Supreme Court has held that speech at a public place on a matter of public concern is entitled to special protection.”0	1
https://www.snopes.com/newsweek-report-trump-impeachment/	Did Newsweek Report That Trump Will Be Impeached and Replaced by Hillary Clinton?	false	['2016 presidential election', ' donald trump', ' hillary clinton']	http://www.newsweek.com/	http://www.newsweek.com/hillary-clinton-president-lawrence-lessig-post-686077	2018/01/23	"On 10/16/17 at 4:00 PMYes, we're (still) rehashing the 2016 election. Timothy A. Clary/AFP/GettyShareUpdated | Sure, it's been more than 340 days since Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton, but there's still one very narrow, highly unlikely and entirely unprecedented way that Clinton could become president.But you never know...In light of the ongoing probe into Russia collusion, Harvard University professor Lawrence Lessig posted on  Medium  a series of ""if/then"" scenarios that would lead to House Speaker Paul Ryan handing the White House keys to Clinton.Related: Hillary Clinton losing to Trump was like Jesus's crucifixionTo be clear, constitutional law expert Lessig is not calling for a Clinton ascendancy, but was merely playing out a hypothetical chain of events should a conspiracy be proven:If number 1: If Trump is definitively found to have colluded directly with Russia, he would be forced to resign or be impeached.If number 2: If Trump is removed, Vice President Mike Pence would become president.If number 3: If Pence becomes president, he should resign too, given that he benefited from the same help from Mother Russia.If number 4: If Pence resigns before appointing a vice president, Ryan would become president.If number 5: If Ryan becomes president, he should do the right thing  and choose Clinton for vice president. Then he should resign.""The answer seems unavoidable: He should nominate the person defeated by the treason of his own party, and then step aside and let her become the president,"" Lessig writes. ""Without doubt, if Ryan did the right thing, that would be the most extraordinary event in the history of America since the Confederate Army fired on Fort Sumter. But unlike that, this event would build the union, not divide it.""Lessig, who briefly ran for the Democratic nomination in 2015, adds that Clinton would then appoint Ryan to be veep out of political goodwill. Americans can only assume that while busy being a president who can read policy documents longer than one page , she'd stop her endless press tour and figure out how to keep the nation from getting nuked.Lessig apparently isn't the only one with Clinton on the brain. Clinton has made it clear she won't run for office again, telling CBS Sunday Morning that she's ""done with being a candidate."" But Trump himself tweeted about the possibility Monday.""I was recently asked if Crooked Hillary Clinton is going to run in 2020?"" he wrote . ""My answer was, 'I hope so!'""Only time will tell if the Russia cloud clears up by then.Story was updated to clarify that Lessig was not advocating for the ""if/then"" scenario, but merely laying it out."	1

The bodies and money trace back to an armored car robbery in Southeast New Mexico. He had the unit on an autopay contract but his credit card expired and due to a juxtoposed number…he never got the notice in the mail.”According to his secretary, John Lewis Prager, he first he heard of it was when it came over the police scanner in the Mayor’s office. “He suddenly had to go,” said Prager, visibly upset, “It’s the last time I’ve seen or heard from him. I’m guessing he knew what was about to happen and went to some other evil storage locker to cash out and escape.”The FBI thinks Prager is right. Foreman reportedly has more than a dozen storage units spread across Missouri and possibly hundreds around the country. He was spotted on surveillance cameras in Hamilton leaving a unit with a bag from an armored car:A bag that size could contain millions in $100 bills or bearer bonds. The FBI also suspects that Foreman has fake passports and various pre-planned escape routes. “Finding him won’t be easy,” said Slurryman, “but we won’t stop until we do.”The mayor’s job in Goose Rapids will revert to Foreman’s Deputy Mayor.	1
https://www.snopes.com/white-house-comment-shutdown/	Did President Trump Shut Down the White House Phone-In Comment Line?	mfalse	['barack obama', ' donald trump', ' white house']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/sN88i	2017/01/24	on January 23, 2017 4:56 pm·In another attempt to stifle freedom of expression, President Trump and his administration have dismantled the White House switchboard comment operating system. Instead, callers will be told to take their complaints and comments to Facebook and other White House social media platforms.When called, the White House switchboard states:“Thank you for calling the White House comments line. The comment line is currently closed but your comment is important to the President and we urge you to send us a comment online at www.WhiteHouse.gov/contact or send us a message through Facebook messenger.”Trump really is becoming the social-media president.Since the end of the transition, when the lines were apparently shut off, the Trump administration has been purging the White House website off all things that generally resemble the Obama White House — and thus anything that has to do with equality and inclusion. So this is just another instance of curtailing the openness of the people’s house.It seems that the 15 percent of American households without internet will not be able to have Trump hear their concerns, who promised to be a champion of all people and listen to their needs.There is no indication yet from the White House whether this is permanent or temporary, as the incoming administration settles into their positions.Still, there was no downtime for this crucial line of democracy when the Obama administration took over in 2009.Given the Trump administration’s penchant for lying and ignoring the people, this should come as no surprise. However, it should worry the public if no future action is taken to address this. The people’s house should be readily available at all times, in all fashions.It’s only day three, and Donald Trump and his team are showing a brazen disregard for the little things that make us great. When studying authoritarians, one must look at how the littlest of things change before their eyes.This might be one of them — a White House that doesn’t want to be bombarded with calls from an outraged public.Featured image by Ron Sachs via Getty ImagesShare this Article!	1
