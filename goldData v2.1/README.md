this is where I keep the examples that can be used on the classifier (Lux)
you can see this examples as the 'clean' data.


'pos_samples.csv' contain the positive examples from the first and second annotations processes. It also has around 50 examples from emergent. No examples from factcheck.

'results.csv' is the result of the annotations performed by me in the third version of the dataset.

'filter.py' filters the good and bad examples from 'results.csv' into 'good_a3.csv' and 'bad_a3.csv' respectively.
