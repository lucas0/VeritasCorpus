<blockquote>
 <p>
  Sing a song of sixpence
  <br>
   A pocket full of rye
   <br/>
   Four and twenty blackbirds
   <br/>
   Baked in a pie
  </br>
 </p>
 <p>
  When the pie was opened
  <br/>
  The birds began to sing
  <br/>
  Was that not a tasty dish
  <br/>
  To set before a king?
 </p>
 <p>
  The King was in his counting house
  <br/>
  Counting out his money
  <br/>
  The Queen was in the parlor
  <br/>
  Eating bread and honey
 </p>
 <p>
  The Maid was in the garden
  <br/>
  Hanging out the clothes
  <br/>
  When down came a blackbird
  <br/>
  And snapped off her nose!
 </p>
