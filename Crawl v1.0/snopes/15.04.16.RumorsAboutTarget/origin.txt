  Vietnam Veterans Not Worthy Of Target’s Help?
  <br/>
  By Dick Forrey, Vietnam Veterans Association.
 </p>
 <p>
  We asked our local Target store to be a sponsor of the Vietnam Veterans’ Memorial Wall during our spring recognition event. We received back a reply from Target management that “veterans do not meet our area of giving. We only donate to the areas of arts, social actions and education.”
 </p>
 <p>
  My thought: If the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall and the Vietnam veteran himself, does not meet the criteria of these areas, something is wrong at Target. We were not asking for thousands of dollars, not even hundreds, but simply sponsorship endorsement for a “memorial remembrance”.
 </p>
 <p>
  As follow-up, I e-mailed the Corporate Headquarters and their response was the same. Personally, I will NOT be buying anything at Target Stores again. If the Vietnam Veteran does not meet their area of giving then why should I as a Vietnam veteran, spend my hard earned money in their stores?
 </p>
 <p>
  Please pass this on to as many people as you know. Maybe Target and other businesses will get the message.
