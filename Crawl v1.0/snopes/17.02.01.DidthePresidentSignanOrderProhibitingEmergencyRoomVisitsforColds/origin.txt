  The executive orders (EO) just keep coming. President Donald Trump just signed an EO stating: “No one is allowed to go to the Emergency Room with a cold.” What?! Is he building a wall around the hospitals? Then he has the audacity to not only limit these miserable citizens from the care they need, but he tells them in the EO that “Antibiotics will not work.”
