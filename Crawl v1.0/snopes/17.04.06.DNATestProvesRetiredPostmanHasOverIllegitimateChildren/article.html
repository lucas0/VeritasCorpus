  On 27 February 2016, the World News Daily Report web site published an article positing that a retired postman had fathered more than 1,300 illegitimate children:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   An 87-year-old former postman has been proven to have fathered over 1,300 illegitimate children after a private investigator hired by a Tennessee family discovered the shocking truth.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Contraception wasn’t very popular in those days,” he told local reporters in his defense. “I have nothing to be ashamed of. The 60s were the good old days and I did a great Johnny Cash impression which played out real good with the ladies,” he explained. “Some even thought I was Johnny Cash for real,” he recalls laughingly. “I don’t know if they really believed it or if they were trying to convince themselves, but who was I to say no to a quickie?” he acknowledged.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  There was no truth to this story, which originated with World News Daily Report (WNDR), a fake news site that does not publish factual stories (as noted in their disclaimer):
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   WNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website – even those based on real people –  are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  In addition to the disclaimer, the fake news story about a postman’s fathering 1,300 illegitimate children was given away as fiction because it featured two unrelated images that were lifted (like all of WNDR’s photographs) from other sites:

  The first image, which purportedly depicts the prolific postman, actually

  a 97-year-old World War II veteran. The second image, which supposedly captures the reported who uncovered the story, is actually
