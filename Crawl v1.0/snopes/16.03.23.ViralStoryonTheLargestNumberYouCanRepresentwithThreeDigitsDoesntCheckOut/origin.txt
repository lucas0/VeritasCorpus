  This post is about my fight against “Standardized Testing” in math, and what later became “Common Core.” It goes back to 2008 when my daughter was in grade school. I got a call to come to the principal’s office. I was surprised, as this was a real first. Like all fathers I suppose, we tend to think of our little girls as angelic and saintlike. In my case, this was the absolute truth.

Right at the outset the details of this narrative are sketchy, because Trice reports that this educational showdown occurred in 2008 but still laid blame on the Common Core curriculum. The Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) and the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices (NGA Center), however, didn't <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2009/07/07242009.html" target="_blank">develop</a> the standards until 2009.

  “Your daughter was being disruptive in class.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It was like an arrow through my heart. I looked over at her. There were tear-streaked marks all down her face. She looked down at her shoes when I shot a glance over at her. And she started sobbing again. The principal continued his monotone diatribe, while I walked over to kneel besides my daughter and hug her.

  “Really, Mr. Trice, that’s not appropriate …”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Your daughter tried to correct her math teacher. The teacher explained why she was wrong, and she insisted that she was correct.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I laughed.
 </p>
 <p>
  I knew she was right and the teacher was wrong. I couldn’t wait to hear this one.
