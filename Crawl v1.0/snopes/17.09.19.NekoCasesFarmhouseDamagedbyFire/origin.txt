  The Vermont home of musician Neko Case, owned by Cobb Timber LLC, was badly damaged in a fire Monday night.

 <p>
  Reported at around 9:30 p.m., the fire had consumed an adjacent barn and was spreading to the 225-year-old farmhouse when firefighters arrived. It could be seen from miles away.

  “I could see the glow in the sky from West Barnet,” said Barnet Fire Capt. Chris Bunnell.
 </p>
 <p>
  Responding departments contained the fire to the home’s southern half, which took heavy damage. The barn was destroyed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fire was called in by a caretaker, who safely evacuated the home on Groton Road with three dogs. No injuries were reported.

  Case was reportedly out of the country when the fire struck.
