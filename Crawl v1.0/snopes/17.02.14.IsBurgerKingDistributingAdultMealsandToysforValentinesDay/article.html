  On 14 February 2017, multiple online outlets published headlines and images intimating that the Burger King fast food chain had introduced an “adult meal” that includes a sex toy:

  The claim was of the sort that is typically spotted and passed along by social media users without closer inspection. Shortened headlines and excerpts in social media posts fostered the belief that Burger King’s newest menu item was burger meal that included French fries and a French tickler — and a widely-shared video didn’t do much to clear up the confusion:

  Articles about the rumor were equally

  (for the most part):

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Well, this Valentine’s Day, Burger King decided that they shouldn’t just limit the “toy with meal” concept to just kids. They’ve created the “adult meal” that includes some “adult toys.”
  </p>
  <p>
   The meal is exclusively offered to those 18-years-old and up, and is only available after 6:00pm. The possible “toys” include a blindfold, a feather duster, and a head massager.
  </p>
  <p>
   It definitely looks like the “adult toys” aren’t a much higher quality than the kids toys. The meal also includes two beers, so you’ll basically have everything you could ever need for a fancy date night with your boo … Tragically, if you thought that this great Valentine’s Day package might be your last minute V-Day plan, the King is being super stingy about where it is offered.

    It seems like this deal is exclusive to Burger King locations in Israel.

  that the promotion would be available only at a single Burger King location, and only for about four hours:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The box, only available to those older than 18 after 6 P.M. at the Rabin Square location in Tel Aviv, will contain two Whoppers, two orders of french fries, two beers and “a romantic adult toy.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Burger King, aware that building up suspense fuels passion, did not reveal which “romantic adult toys” would be included, but a promotional video showcases a blindfold, a feather tickler and a head massager.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Although details about Burger King Israel’s “adult meal” (or included adult toys) were difficult to locate, the promotion appears be be extremely limited — restricted to several hours on a single night (14 February 2017) at one Tel Aviv Burger King locations.
