  On 5 November 2016, a web site called
  <em>
   The Resistance: The Last Line of Defense
  </em>
  published an
  <a href="http://thelastlineofdefense.org/woah-hillary-caught-on-hot-mic-trashing-beyonce-with-racial-slurs/" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  in which it was claimed that pop singer Beyonce had stormed off the stage during a performance at a Hillary Clinton rally after overhearing the Democratic presidential candidate utter racial slurs into a live microphone:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   During Friday Night’s Hillary Clinton rally in Ohio, Beyonce’ Knowles, known for her liberal ideals and anti-police rhetoric, was performing a free set for the murderous email queen when she suddenly stopped singing. She turned towards the side of the stage where Hillary was standing and said, “You’re in my earpiece.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Clinton, looking surprised, gave a smile and started clapping. Beyonce’ continued her performance but cut it short after just two songs. She was seen storming off stage and leaving the venue in a limousine shortly thereafter.
  </p>

   A reporter from the local Parma Gazette asked around and found out from a sound tech that Clinton’s lapel mic was hot and all of the staff were listening when she said:
  </p>
  <p>
   “I’m grateful, but do we really need to listen to this ghetto trash music? Doesn’t she have something a little less…negro?”
  </p>

  Although a large number of people who shared the story via social media apparently thought it was true, the incident reported therein did not occur. Beyonce and Jay Z

  at a rally for Clinton on 4 November 2016, but Clinton was not overheard disparaging Beyonce’s music, nor using racial slurs, nor did Beyonce storm off the stage.
