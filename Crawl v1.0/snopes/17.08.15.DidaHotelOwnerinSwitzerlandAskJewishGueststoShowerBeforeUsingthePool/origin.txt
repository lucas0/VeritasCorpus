<blockquote>
 <p>
  A haredi [strict orthodox Jewish] family from Israel received a shock when they found an antisemitic sign at the Swiss hotel they were staying at. The family had found the Aparthaus Paradies hotel in the town of Arosa, Switzerland online. Previous guests had given the hotel positive ratings.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, when the family arrived at the hotel, they were greeted by a sign instructing all Jewish guests to shower before and after using the swimming pool. The sign read in broken English: “To our Jewish guests, men women and children, please take a shower before you go swimming and although [sic] after swimming.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The sign contained a threat to ban Jewish swimmers if they failed to comply. “If you break the rules, I’m forced to cloes [sic] the pool for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Thank you for understanding, Ruth Thomann,” the sign concludes.
