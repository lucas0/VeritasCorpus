    This was taken by Computer game Artist Russell Hughes when he was working for Stainless Games back at our farmhouse offices in the Isle of Wight

   That spot is infamous for flooding. So on that stormy day we were all by the roadside laughing at those who didn’t know how to drive through a flood.

   Later (after the pub, blacksmiths arms just up the road) he turned his photo into this. He then sent it to the company. It escaped when Matt Edmunds sent it to his friend at Reuters. It then became ‘news picture of the day’ and that was that. Within the day we were getting emails from our friends from round the world saying have you seen this ?
