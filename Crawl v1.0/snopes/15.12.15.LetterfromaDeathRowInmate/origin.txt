 <p>
  A death row inmate awaiting execution, asked as a last wish a pencil and paper. After writing for several minutes, the convict called the prison guard and asked that this letter be handed over to his biological mother.
 </p>
 <p>
  The letter said …
 </p>
 <p>
  Mother, if there were more justice in this world, we would be both executed and not just me. You’re as guilty as I am for the life I led.
 </p>
 <p>
  Remind yourself when I stole and bring home the bicycle of a boy like me? You helped me to hide the bicycle for my father did not see it. Do you remember the time I stole money from the neighbor’s wallet?
 </p>
 <p>
  You went with me to the mall to spend it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Do you remember when I argued with my father and he’s gone?
 </p>
 <p>
  He just wanted to correct me because I stole the final result of the
  <br>
   competition and for that I had been expelled.
  </br>
 </p>
 <p>
  Mom, I was just a child, shortly after I became a troubled teenager and now I’m a pretty malformed man.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mom, I was just a child in need of correction, and not an approval. But I forgive you!
 </p>
 <p>
  I just want this letter to reach the greatest number of parents in the
  <br/>
  world, so they can know what makes all people, good or bad …is education. Thank you mother for giving me life and also helping me to lose it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your child offender.
 </p>
