  On 23 March 2017, an assortment of left-leaning political web sites, including

   Occupy Democrats

  , published articles reporting that Russian dissident Denis Voronenkov, who was
  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/23/europe/ukraine-former-russian-lawmaker-denis-voronenkov-killed/" target="_blank">
   shot
  </a>
  dead earlier that same day in Ukraine, was to have been a “star witness” in a treason trial involving former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Yesterday, documents surfaced showing that former Trump Campaign Chair Paul Manafort had received at least $750,000 in illegal payments from former Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovych, who is about to be tried for treason in absentia in Ukraine.
  </p>
  <p>
   Today, Denis Voronenkov was shot to death in the streets of Kiev in broad daylight, just a few weeks after he said he would testify against Yanukovych and his cohorts — Manafort included.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is only the latest in a list of Russian dissidents to be murdered or die under mysterious circumstances since the U.S. Election. The timing of Voronenkov’s murder in conjunction with the latest revelations about Manafort — a man he was likely to incriminate — makes this latest tragedy all the more suspect.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The clear implication was that the purpose of the killing may have been (at least in part) to prevent Voronenkov, a former member of Russia’s parliament and Putin critic who fled to Ukraine, from incriminating Manafort at Yanukovych’s trial, scheduled to take place in March 2017.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mainstream news outlets such as CNN had
  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/23/europe/ukraine-former-russian-lawmaker-denis-voronenkov-killed/" target="_blank">
   reported
  </a>
  that Voronenkov was indeed cooperating with Ukrainian prosecutors and would be a “key witness” against Yanukovych.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, we have encountered no evidence that Voronenkov planned to testify about Paul Manafort in any respect. In fact, Voronenkov
  <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/02/17/russian-spy-whistleblowers-turn-on-putin-but-can-they-be-trusted.html" target="_blank">
   stated
  </a>
  as recently as February 2017 that he knew nothing about Manafort.
 </p>
 <p>
  As previously reported, Manafort
  <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/paul-manafort-resigns-from-trump-campaign-227197" target="_blank">
   resigned
  </a>
  after serving five months as Donald Trump’s campaign manager in August 2016 after handwritten
  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/15/us/politics/paul-manafort-ukraine-donald-trump.html" target="_blank">
   ledgers
  </a>
  published in the
  <em>
   New York Times
  </em>
  indicated he had received $12.7 million in “illegal” cash payments (according to Ukrainian anti-corruption investigators) from Victor Yanukovych’s Moscow-backed political party between 2007 and 2012. Although Manafort denied receiving such payments, he stepped down from the Trump organization at a moment when it was combating general allegations about ties between the campaign and Russia (as of this writing, those alleged ties are still the subject of an FBI
  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/20/politics/comey-hearing-russia-wiretapping/" target="_blank">
   investigation
  </a>
  ).
 </p>
 <p>
  Even so, any imputation of a link between the shooting of Denis Voronenkov and Manafort’s dealings with Victor Yanukovych is purely speculative, and indeed contradicts Voronenkov’s own public statements in that regard.
