   article

  reporting that in an interview, President Donald Trump’s former wife Ivana had claimed her ex-husband was “addicted” to penis enlargement pills:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Donald Trump’s socialite ex-wife Ivana, says the President has been addicted to penis enlargement drugs for more than 30 years and still ingests at least 45 pills a day.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an exclusive interview with CNTV-4, Ivana Trumps [sic] claimed the American President is obsessed with the size of his genitals, and has already tested “every product on the market” in order to increase the size of his penis.
  </p>
  <p>
   “When we were married, he would take 5 or 6 different types of drugs at the same time and he used his penis pump twice a day. He would also measure his dick every night to see if it had grown.”
  </p>
  <p>
   According to the former model and socialite, he even overdosed twice, in 1989 and 1991, after ingesting more than 300 penis enlargement pills in a day.
  </p>
  <p>
   “He literally popped pills like candy. It made him sick and gave no results, but he kept taking more and more. It was one of the main reasons we got divorced.”
  </p>
  <p>
   She says the president still takes penis enlargement drugs, but has reduced and stabilized his consumption to approximately 45 to 60 pills a day.
  </p>

  The article included a screenshot from a video that readers would infer was a recording of the supposedly recent interview in which Ivana made this startling admission, but in fact the clip from which the screenshot was taken had appeared on YouTube as early as January 2013 and did not include the former Mrs. Trump’s mentioning penis enlargement pills:

  A video isn’t necessary to determine that this rumor is not credible, however.  This story was reported nowhere but Huzlers, a satire (i.e., fake news) web site dealing solely in salacious falsehoods whose disclaimer notes that it is the “most notorious fauxtire &amp; satire entertainment website in the world.”
