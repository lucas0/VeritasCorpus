  Toupee, or not toupee?
 </p>
 <p>
  Much ado has been made about President Trump’s unique

  over the years. He has often stated that he has a full head of hair, a trait that has been tested by various
  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03l9drt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   journalists
  </a>
  and

  </a>
  , but critics have repeatedly accused the commander-in-chief of dabbling in some sort of follicle fakery.

  <a href="https://thetab.com/us/2016/08/18/trump-statue-48716" target="_blank">
   appearance
  </a>
  speak particularly well of his critics. Yet, these toupee truthers took to Twitter with a supposed damning piece of evidence in early February 2018 when a video purportedly showing the President’s hair, or wig, getting tossed around in the wind was posted online:

  This isn’t the first time that Trump’s hair has been pushed into odd positions on film. In fact, Vanity Fair collected a series of
  <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2017/02/donald-trump-versus-the-wind" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   photographs
  </a>
  showing the seemingly ongoing battle between Donald Trump’s hair and the wind. Still, some viewers were
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/441333919315986/permalink/1604140263035340/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   convinced

  that the above-displayed footage had been doctored:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   First let me say that I do not like anything about #45. But this video is all over Facebook, and it doesn’t look right. It looks like the hair has been altered. It doesn’t look real. Can you please look into this?
  </p>

  This video is real. It is a cropped version of footage showing President Trump boarding Air Force One on 2 February 2018 before departing for Florida. An uncropped
