  </a>
  about the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service describes the medal as follows:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   This is the highest honorary award presented by the Secretary of Defense to non-career Federal employees, private citizens, and foreign nationals. The Secretary of Defense is the approval authority. This award consists of a gold medal, a miniature medal, a rosette, and a citation signed by the Secretary of Defense. An individual may receive this award more than once. Subsequent awards consist of the foregoing recognition devices and a bronze, silver, or gold palm, as appropriate.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Although the Department of Defense (DoD) is part of the executive branch, the President himself does not play a part in the nomination or approval process for recipients of the DoD’s Medal for Distinguished Public Service:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Heads of the OSD Components and Secretaries of Military Departments shall submit nominations by memorandum to the DA&amp;M, OSD, through the Assistant Director for Labor and Management Employee Relations, Directorate for Personnel and Security, WHS. The Secretary of Defense is the approval authority.
  </p>

  Previous recipients of the medal include former Presidents

  Despite
  <em>
   Breitbart
  </em>
  ‘s statements that commenters were “incredulous at the award,” likened it to “a much maligned ‘participation medal'” and “were skeptical of Obama’s underling giving his own boss a medal,” no similar comments seem to have been noted by
  <em>
   Breitbart
  </em>
  when President George W. Bush received the very same medal in January 2009, nor did we find any record that
  <em>
   Breitbart
  </em>
  (or any other source) published a “President Bush Awards Himself Distinguished Public Service Medal” article upon that occasion.
