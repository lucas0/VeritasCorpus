  It’s pretty sad to look around and see how police officers are being treated right now. They put their lives on the line every single day to defend our freedoms within the local community. We are more than thankful for our military, yet we fail to recognize the very people that keep us safe in our homes at night.

  Police officers don’t get paid a lot either. They knowingly walk into possible gunfights almost every day. They do it because they heard the call to serve. They do it because they are true American patriots.

  Well, there was just another case of disrespect against cops. In Alabama, last week a cashier decided that she didn’t want to serve the cops.

  Maria Englesia pictured above told the officers to “get out of here” because they “didn’t serve pigs.” This was blatant.

  McDonalds stepped in as soon as they heard what happened. They immediately fired the woman and issued a formal apology to the police department of Alabama.
