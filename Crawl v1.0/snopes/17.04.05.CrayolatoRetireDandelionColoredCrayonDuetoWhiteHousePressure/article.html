  a worldwide marketing campaign announcing the retirement of one of its 24 basic crayon colors, “dandelion,” to make room for a new shade of blue (yet to be named). It is not the first time the company has switched out hues. Amidst much

  , dandelion was introduced in 1990 along with eight other new shades. Four more colors came and went in 2003.

  The 2017 promotion inspired some good-natured spoofing in mass and social media, including an NBC

   According to a Crayola spokesperson, commenting off the record, a senior Trump staffer called the Pennsylvania-based company last week and asked them to sack the yellow-orange hue — which is very similar to the president’s odd hair and skin coloring — after children nationwide were using it to create unflattering drawings of Mr. Trump.

   “Our Dandelion color is almost the exact shade of an orangutan’s coat,” said the Crayola representative. “Apparently, one of the president’s own grandchildren walked into the Oval Office with a drawing of a monkey and an arrow pointing to it that said, ‘Grandpa.’ The incident reportedly sent Mr. Trump through the roof.”
