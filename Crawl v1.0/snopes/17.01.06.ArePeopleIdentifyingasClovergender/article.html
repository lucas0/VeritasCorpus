  In early 2017 discussion of a new identity known as “clovergender” began appearing on social media, perhaps most prominently in a series of tweets published by “pharmabro”

  On 1 January 2017 the term appeared as in a Reddit

  Normally, legitimate but lesser-known

  </a>
  and gender identities accrue a presence on the Internet (such as in forum threads or social media mentions) before becoming a widespread topic of discussion. We should point out that the definition of “clovergender” does not describe any form of gender, but a sexual identity generally accepted as deviant. That the concept appeared from the ether on or around 1 January 2017 strongly suggests it was a hoax.

 <p>
  Several users captured 4chan screenshots from 31 December 2016 and 1 January 2017 demonstrating that the “clovergender” idea was cooked up by resident pranksters in an attempt to mock individuals of non-binary gender (i.e., transgender people, gender fluid people, and people of alternate gender):

  The “clovergender” hoax was referenced on subsequent 4chan
  <a href="http://archive.is/6VSzZ" target="_blank">
   submissions
  </a>
  , prompting users to reiterate that the claim was a hoax. (The “clover” symbol has long been associated with 4chan.) Concurrent
  <a href="http://archive.is/93RB4" target="_blank">
   threads
  </a>
  discussed building upon the non-existent gender identity to further agitate and aggravate the individuals targeted by the prank. The underlying intent of the clovergender hoax appeared to be undermining the legitimacy of transgender identity, by suggesting its existence enabled anyone to normalize any behavior or trait (even the most taboo practices) as a “gender.” The hoax is apparently part of a years-long tradition on the part of
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2016/07/14/for-public-purity/" target="_blank">
   4chan
  </a>
  and
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/black-protesters-targeted-whites-in-milwaukee/" target="_blank">

  to dupe the media and social media with fantastical claims of non-existent trends and events.
