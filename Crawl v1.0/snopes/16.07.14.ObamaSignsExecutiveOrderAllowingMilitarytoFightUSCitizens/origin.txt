<blockquote>
 <p>
  President Obama has signed an executive order that allows for the US military to use force against American citizens for the first time in history.
 </p>
 <p>
  The order was signed on July 1st, 2016 and is titled “Executive Order — United States Policy on Pre- and Post-Strike Measures to Address Civilian Casualties in U.S. Operations Involving the Use of Force“.
 </p>
 <p>
  The order looks like the rules of engagement between the military vs ordinary US citizens have significantly and unconstitutionally changed.
