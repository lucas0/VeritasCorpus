  The media has mischaracterized my recent statements on the Assad regime. It was not my intention to imply that Hitler had never used chemical weapons, but that he never used them on fellow Germans.

  At the point where Assad is attacking his own people with chemical weapons, you have to wonder if he is willing to do the same to United States citizens.
