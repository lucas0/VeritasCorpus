 <p>
  Angry Facebook users took to social media network to slam a delivery driver who crashed his truck and destroyed hundreds of packages just 10 days before Christmas.
 </p>
 <p>
  The trailer rolled over and broke open on Interstate 287 exit ramp in Mahwah, New Jersey.
 </p>
 <p>
  No injuries were reported, according to local news, but Facebook commenters would not let up on the unfortunate driver. Many appeared to care more about the damaged gifts than the safety of the driver and other local commuters.

 <p>
  According to reports the driver [name redacted] went home and read these comments on his personal computer. He took them very hard. Already depressed, he took his own life at 8:27 PM EST at his home in New Jersey.
