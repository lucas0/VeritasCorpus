  Tim Hortons has made a shocking announcement and has removed ham and bacon from almost 4,600 locations, and switched to halal meat alternatives in an attempt to please its Muslim customers.
 </p>
 <p>
  It has confirmed turkey ham and turkey rashers will be used instead in 3,500 of its stores, where all the meat will now be prepared according to halal rules.
 </p>
 <p>
  The chain, which has around 4,600 outlets across the Canada and US, explained its decision by saying it had to balance animal welfare concerns with ‘the views of religious communities’.
 </p>
 <p>
  This has not been confirmed by any news outlets yet as to protect it’s customers.
