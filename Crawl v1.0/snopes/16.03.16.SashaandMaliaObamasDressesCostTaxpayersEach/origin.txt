  ’s Lorne Michaels and actress Sandra Oh, wore a strapless faille gown with crystal beading from the pre-fall 2015 collection. The 100 percent silk piece is no longer available for purchase, but it originally retailed for $17,990. The embellished piece didn’t need any more bling, so she went without jewelry. Malia blew out her hair in loose waves and had a subtle cat eye and nude lips.

  While Malia went for a more classic, elegant look, her younger sister added a young, fresh flair. Also in Naeem Khan, Sasha chose a look from the Indian-American designer’s resort 2016 collection, a gown embroidered with allover threadwork, beading, and appliqué, accentuated by a fitted bodice and ball skirt. The 14-year-old complemented the red, black, and sheer piece, which retails for $19,990, by styling her hair in Dutch braids and tying a thin ribbon around her neck as a choker.
