  Kiel Brothers Oil Company and a related C corporation KP Oil Inc ran over 200 convenience store gas stations in Indiana and surrounding states. Edward Pence, Mike’s father had spent his career there and Gregory Pence, Mike’s brother, was CEO towards the end.  It was a family business, but not really a Pence family business. The original Kiels were still around.
