 <p>
  This is an advertisement from the yellow pages, until they realised that if you turned it upside down and covered the lady’s head and the hand holding the glass, all was not as it seemed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The telephone company has now taken this ad out because of the content.
 </p>
 <p>
  Take a look at the first picture, and then the second picture (which is an inverted version of the first), watch as her face and the glass are
  <nobr>
   covered — and
  </nobr>
  see what you get.
 </p>
 <p>
  P.S. Where do people find the time to read the Yellow Pages UPSIDE DOWN??

  Some critics have long maintained that companies and their advertising agencies often employ
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/business/hidden/popcorn.asp" target="popcorn">
   subliminal advertising
  </a>
  to increase sales by concealing words and images (usually of a sexually suggestive nature) in their advertisements.  The nature of “subliminal,” of course, means that these alleged hidden persuaders are not obvious to the ordinary viewer and may require intense scrutiny or an unusual approach (such as viewing an image backwards, upside-down, or with a magnifying glass) to discern.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such is the nature of the putative advertisement from the Yellow Pages (a pre-Internet printed phone directory of business services) for a flooring company displayed above, which is accompanied by an illustration of a woman holding a champagne glass that, when flipped upside-down and cropped in half horizontally, resembles an image of a woman with no lower undergarments touching herself in a strategically sensitive area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Several clues might suggest that this image was something put together as a joke rather than a genuine Yellow Pages ad:
 </p>
 <p>
  <ul type="Disc">
   <br>
    <li>
     The subject
     <nobr>
      matter — a
     </nobr>
     woman holding a champagne
     <nobr>
      glass — seemingly
     </nobr>
     has nothing to do with the product or service being advertised, which is flooring.  (As the graphic displayed at the bottom of this page indicates, the illustration may have originated with items commonly distributed in bars and restaurants, such as matchbooks or cocktail napkins.)
    </li>
   </br>
  </ul>
 </p>
 <p>
  <li>
   The headline of the ad (“LAID BY THE BEST”) is an obvious sexual double entendre.
  </li>
 </p>
 <p>
  <li>
   The phone number(s) listed appears
   <nobr>
    odd — 21 digits
   </nobr>
   long or two numbers of differing lengths.  (This can actually be explained rationally, because in some parts of the world the different systems used for landline and mobile phones produced phone numbers with different numbers of digits.)
  </li>
 </p>
 <p>
  <li>
   The ad includes no address or other location information.
