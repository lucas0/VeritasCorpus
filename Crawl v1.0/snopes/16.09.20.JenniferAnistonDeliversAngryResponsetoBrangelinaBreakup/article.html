  On 20 September 2016, Angelina Jolie’s attorney released a statement confirming that the actress had filed for a
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2016/09/20/angelina-jolie-files-for-divorce/" target="_blank">
   divorce
  </a>
  from her actor husband Brad Pitt. The news caused a stir on social media as many people speculated how actress Jennifer Aniston, Pitt’s previous wife, would handle the news.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cue entertainment web site The Good Lord Above, who took advantage of the situation to post an article reporting that Aniston gave a furious response when she was asked about the divorce during an appearance on the
  <em>
   Today Show
  </em>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “F*ck society, you people make me sick,” said Aniston on the Today show. “While you idiots are talking about this Brangelina bullsh*t, you’re ignoring what just happened yesterday with Terence Crutcher. An unarmed black father of four was driving home from college when his car broke down. The police showed up and shot him while both of his hands were in the air. This was all caught on video, which you can easily watch on the Internet. But instead, no, none of you will do that. You will instead focus on the fact that a celebrity couple is going through a divorce. F*ck you.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Aniston continued:
  </p>
  <p>
   “The same people that get super offended and lose their minds over whether or not an athlete takes a knee during the National Anthem don’t give two sh*ts when an innocent person is executed with video evidence. They always say that it ‘needs more investigation.’ What is the matter with people? Do they not have souls? This country needs to get its shit together, stop shooting its citizens, and stop focusing on stupid nonsense so much.”
  </p>

 <p>
  Jennifer Aniston did not make these comments, nor did she appear on the
  <em>
   Today Show
  </em>
  on 20 September 2016 to talk about Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s divorce.
