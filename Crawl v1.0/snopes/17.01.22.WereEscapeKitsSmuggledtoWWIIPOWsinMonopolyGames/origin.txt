  When allied airmen began to risk their lives flying missions over occupied Europe, Parker Brothers’ English partner found a way to use the
  <em>
   Monopoly
  </em>
  game to come to the aid of those who were captured by the Germans. The British War Office worked with a select group of Waddington staffers to modify
  <em>
   Monopoly
  </em>
  boards for insertion in games that the Red Cross would deliver to Allied prisoners of war. These men carved out precise depressions in the unfinished game boards and, before applying their labels, filled them with low-profile compasses, files, and maps that depicted escape routes from the prison camp where each game was to be sent. (The maps were printed on silk because silk did not rustle when opened. Waddington’s had perfected this process to such an extent that virtually all British flyers climbed into their warplanes with a Waddington’s map secreted in the heel of one of their boots.) Hidden among the games’ play money was real

   currency — German,
  </nobr>
  Italian, or Austrian. It is not known how many airmen escaped thanks to these
  <em>
   Monopoly
  </em>
  games.
