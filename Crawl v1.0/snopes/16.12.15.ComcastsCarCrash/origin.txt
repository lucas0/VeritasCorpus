  Our employees should always protect people and treat them with respect no matter what the situation. Safety matters most – especially in dangerous weather conditions like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  We are actively investigating what happened when our technicians were on site to restore services during an outage and we will reach out to those who were impacted by this incident.
 </p>
 <p>
  Within the next 24-48 hours, my team leaders will meet with our technicians across our company to use this as an example of how important it is to make everyone’s safety a priority in everything we do.
 </p>
 <p>
  And just as important, there’s no place for disrespect – treating people the right way is the only way to work.
