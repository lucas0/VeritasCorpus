 <p>
  A Michigan elector, in a surge of despair at the election of Donald Trump to the US presidency, has taken his life.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 47-year-old man, who leaves behind his wife and six children, took his own life to avoid voting for Donald Trump during the Electoral College that will swear the next president-elect this week.
 </p>
 <p>
  A letter he wrote before taking his own life explains the reasons for his apparent suicide.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “I do not want to carry the burden of Trump’s election on my shoulders, so for the greater good of my children and future generations, I am doing what I believe is best for my country and I hope others will follow in my footsteps ”
  </em>
