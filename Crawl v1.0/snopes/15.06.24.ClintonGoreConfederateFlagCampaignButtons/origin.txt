  According to a longtime aide to former President Bill Clinton, the button was not an official campaign item.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’ve never seen these buttons,” Craig Smith [said]. “Don’t have them, haven’t seen them.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Smith oversaw state operations for Mr. Clinton’s campaign in 1992, before moving on to work in the Clinton White House. Among his responsibilities on the trail was allocating staff to states and sending out campaign materials, like house party kits,
  <nobr>
   t-shirts,
  </nobr>
  yard signs and buttons, nationwide. Every item, he said, had to be made in the United States by union workers.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it didn’t have a union bug, we weren’t making them,” he said, “and we definitely weren’t handing them out.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The button in question, and others featuring similar designs for sale or sold on eBay, does not show any indication of being union-made.
 </p>
 <p>
  Smith said he thought the buttons were likely made by someone unaffiliated with the campaign looking to make a buck. He said if it had been pitched to him, it wouldn’t have gotten past his desk.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not appropriate then,” he said, “and not appropriate now.”
