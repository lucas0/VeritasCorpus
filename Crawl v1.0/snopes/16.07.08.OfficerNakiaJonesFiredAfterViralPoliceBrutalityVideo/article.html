  Jones’ video was viewed more than six million times in just two days, rapidly introducing her to a massive social media audience.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not long after the video was shared widely, the web site
  <em>
   Ask Kissy
  </em>
  published a

  that claimed Jones had been disciplined (or possibly fired) for airing her views on the social network. The site appeared to conclude from statements made by Jones at a press conference that she had been suspended or terminated from her position:

  New York-area radio station WQHT further stirred the pot in a blog
  <a href="http://www.hot97.com/news/nessa/did-officer-nakia-jones-get-fired-speaking-against-police-photo" target="_blank">
   post
  </a>
  suggestively titled “Did Officer Nakia Jones Get Fired For Speaking Against Police?! [PHOTO].” However, the tail end of that post said:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The mayor of Warrensville, Ohio, Brad Sellers shot down the rumors during a recent press conference.

  Cleveland affiliate WOIO previously
  <a href="http://www.cleveland19.com/story/32402834/mayor-warrensville-officer-nakia-jones-did-not-violate-social-media-policy" target="_blank">
   reported
  </a>
  that Jones was neither fired nor suspended for her viral video, making their headline misleading:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Mayor Brad Sellers said Jones did not violate the social media policy that is currently in place. She is currently on full duty at the police department and there was not violations of any policies with the City of Warrensville Heights.
  </p>
  <p>
   The city said it’s received threats to city hall by the KKK.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  Media personality Roland Martin attempted to halt the spread of the rumor:
