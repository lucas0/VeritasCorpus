  We point out that we have never been asked to put a Christian symbol (or any other religious symbol) on our food requiring that we send money to a Christian organization for the right to do so.
 </p>
 <p>
  Others would add that money paid to ANY Muslim ‘organization’ (and you had better believe it: these people ARE ‘organized’) can easily find its way into the hands of Islamic extremist-fanatics and murderers, irrespective of assurances to the contrary.
 </p>
 <p>
  What other assurances do we accept from Muslims?
 </p>
 <p>
  Oh, that’s right, ‘Islam is a religion of PEACE’!

  How less Australian can companies get, than to place money into the hands of those who seek to exploit us?”
 </p>
 <p>
  This is an example of how the leaders of Muslims in Australia/NewZealand are bullying large commercial organizations (especially in the food industry) into paying what is no more than blatant extortion money. The amazing part is that these weak-kneed organizations (Cadbury/ Schweppes/ Nestles/ Kraft etc.) actually pay the large sums demanded by these self-appointed religious bureaucrats.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the manufacturers promptly pass this levy on to unwitting consumers as cost increases. Next time you buy a block of Cadbury’s chocolate, look for the Halal Certification seal on the wrapper. So, regardless of your own religious faith, you end up subsidizing Islam.
  <br>
   The Council also controls the Muslim voter bloc which, as yet, does not have sufficient critical mass to make a difference – but give them time.

 <p>
  Several state jurisdictions are under pressure to adopt or permit Sharia Law in Marriage, Family and Property matters and some, under the delusion that they are being progressively liberal, are permitting this. This has already happened in some local authorities in the U.K. Google the U.K. Education Department’s current investigation into the conduct of Muslim-run schools in the Birmingham area of England.

 <p>
  How many more warnings do people need?
 </p>
 <p>
  Check the produce on the shelf and don’t buy anything Muslim extorted.
