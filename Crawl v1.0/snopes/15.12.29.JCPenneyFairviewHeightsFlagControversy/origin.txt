   The photo session referenced by the customer took place at our Fairview Heights, IL, store in a photo studio operated by Lifetouch, a photo company that leases space in many of our locations.

  <span class="s1">
   Unfortunately, the Lifetouch associate misinterpreted Lifetouch’s flag photography policy — which details how flags should be displayed with the utmost respect and dignity — to mean that no flags could be photographed whatsoever.

   Lifetouch has been in touch with the customer to apologize for the regrettable incident, and is arranging photo service compensation.
