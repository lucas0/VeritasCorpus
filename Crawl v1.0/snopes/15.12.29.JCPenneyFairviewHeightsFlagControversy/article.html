  On 26 December 2015, Facebook user Sarah Lester published the above-reproduced complaint, claiming the JC Penney Portrait Studio in Fairview Heights, Illinois refused to include an American flag in a memorial photo shoot commemorating her grandfather’s passing; the reason Lester provided was that the store’s beliefs conflicted with the flag.
 </p>
 <p>
  We contacted Lester for more information, and called the store in question. That JC Penney location directed us to their corporate offices, who told us:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p1">
   <span class="s1">
    The photo session referenced by the customer took place at our Fairview Heights, IL, store in a photo studio operated by Lifetouch, a photo company that leases space in many of our locations.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
   <span class="s1">
    Unfortunately, the Lifetouch associate misinterpreted Lifetouch’s flag photography policy — which details how flags should be displayed with the utmost respect and dignity — to mean that no flags could be photographed whatsoever.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
   <span class="s1">
    Lifetouch has been in touch with the customer to apologize for the regrettable incident, and is arranging photo service compensation.
   </span>
