   Various reports in Singapore media have said
  </strong>
  that Chinese companies are mass producing fake rice made, in part, out of plastic, according to one online publication Very Vietnam … “
  <strong>
   A Chinese Restaurant Association official said that eating three bowls of this fake rice would be like eating one plastic bag.
  </strong>
  Due to the seriousness of the matter, he added that there would be an investigation of factories alleged to be producing the rice,” Very Vietnam noted.
 </p>
 <p>
  The “rice” is made by mixing potatoes, sweet potatoes and plastic. The potatoes are first formed into the shape of rice grains. Industrial synthetic resins are then added to the mix.
  <strong>
   The rice reportedly stays hard even after being cooked
  </strong>
  … About 300,000 people were injured and at least six infants died in 2008 when Chinese milk and infant formula was found to be adulterated with melamine, which was thought to help the milk pass nutrition tests.
 </p>
 <p>
  Later that year, melamine was also discovered in Chinese eggs.
