  According to a recent law passed in South Africa, all HIV-positive people will be marked near their genitals by year end. They will be marked with an HIV tattoo that will reflect their identity. President Zuma signed a bill that seems to be the biggest step in the history of time. Jacob Zuma after signing the bill said, “The mark is to protect those who can’t say no to sex. I mean if you can’t read between the lines, you can read between the legs because there is where the status will be tattooed.”
