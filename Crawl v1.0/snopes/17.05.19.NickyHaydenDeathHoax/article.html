  On 19 May 2017, the web site Reports-TV.com
  <em>
  </em>
  published a tasteless
  <a href="https://archive.is/rtwJj" target="_blank">
   fake news
  </a>
  article that included the claim that motorcycle race champion Nicky Hayden had passed away after a cycling incident in Italy:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Former MotoGP [a motorcycle race] champion Nicky Hayden who was in an “extremely critical” condition has died, family announces in a statement.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to the statement the family was by his side after suffering “serious cerebral damage” in a cycling accident on Wednesday until his death this morning.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Nicky Hayden did in fact suffer serious injuries while cycling in Italy. However, his family did not release a statement on 19 May 2017 informing the public that the motorcycle racer had passed away. In fact, Earl Hayden, Nicky’s father, told

  <em>
  </em>
  that rumor was not true and this article was fake news:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I spoke to Earl this morning, and adding to the family’s pain has been a cascade of FAKE NEWS posted all over the internet, including by alleged professional news organizations that should know better.
  </p>
  <p>
   Earl told me the following:
  </p>
  <p>
   The family HAS NOT issued a statement that Nicky is dead.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nicky IS NOT dead, although he is on life support.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nicky was riding his bicycle alone, NOT in a group of 14 riders.
  </p>
  <p>
   Doctors DID NOT perform surgery on Nicky.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nicky WAS NEVER in an induced coma.
