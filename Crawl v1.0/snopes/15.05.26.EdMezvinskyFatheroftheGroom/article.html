  On 31 July 2010, 30-year-old Chelsea Clinton (the daughter of former
  <nobr>
   U.S. president
  </nobr>
  Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton), who had recently received a master’s degree from Columbia University’s
  <nobr>
   Joseph L.
  </nobr>
  Mailman School of Public Health, married
  <nobr>
   32-year-old
  </nobr>
  Marc Mezvinsky, an investment banker.  These nuptials were no ordinary occasion, however: the event was widely covered by U.S. and international news media because the bride’s parents were two of the most prominent
  <nobr>
   U.S. politicians
  </nobr>
  of recent decades: former president Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.  Less known to the general public was the fact that both of the groom’s parents were also politicians at the federal level: former congressman Edward Mezvinsky of Iowa and former congresswoman Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinksy of Pennsylvania.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the
  <em>
   Houston Chronicle
  </em>
  noted, the lives of the Clinton and Mezvinsky parents were intertwined, both personally and politically, long before the Chelsea Clinton and Marc Mezvinsky announced their engagement in
  <nobr>
   November 2009 — and
  </nobr>
  some of those links were decidedly controversial:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Clintons and Mezvinskys have long been political allies and friends.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993, Margolies-Mezvinsky, then a freshman Democrat, cast the vote that got President Bill Clinton’s controversial tax package through the House of Representatives.
  </p>
  <p>
   “She earned an honored place in history, with a vote she shouldn’t have had to cast,” Bill Clinton wrote in “My Life,” his 2004 memoir.
  </p>
  <p>
   On a darker note, federal prosecutors said Ed Mezvinsky habitually dropped the Clintons’ names and boasted of their friendship during the 1990s as he defrauded friends, family members and institutions out of more than
   <nobr>
    $10 million.
   </nobr>
  </p>
  <p>
   Ed Mezvinsky was sentenced in 2003 to serve
   <nobr>
    80 months
   </nobr>
   in federal prison after pleading guilty to a massive fraud that prosecutors said amounted to a Ponzi scheme. He was released from custody in April 2008, but remains under federal probation supervision.
  </p>
  <p>
   Both he and his wife were forced into bankruptcy, and they quietly divorced in 2007, court records show.
  </p>
  <p>
   Margolies-Mezvinsky was not implicated in any wrongdoing, but the scandal effectively ended her political ambitions. She founded and remains at the helm of Women’s Campaign International, a nonprofit dedicated to the political empowerment of women.
