  </em>
  published an article reporting that actor Leonardo DiCaprio had endorsed Donald Trump on Twitter after meeting with President Obama:

  The message displayed here is a hoax.

  did not provide a link to this alleged message, there is no visible timestamp, and this tweet does not appear on DiCaprio’s timeline. Moreover, it is unclear how a meeting with President Barack Obama would result in Leonardo DiCaprio endorsing for Donald Trump.

  The actor did meet with President Obama in September 2016, but this was to discuss the issue of climate change:

  DiCaprio’s political advocacy has almost exclusively been tied to the issue of climate change. While Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton calls climate change “an urgent threat and a defining challenge of our time” on her web site, Trump’s

   position
  </a>
  on the issue has been mixed.

 <p>
  DiCaprio had also been scheduled to
  <a href="http://variety.com/2016/biz/news/leonardo-dicaprio-hillary-clinton-1201828101/" target="_blank">
   host
  </a>
  a fundraising dinner for Clinton just weeks before:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The event on Aug. 23 is priced at $33,400-per-person and is billed as a “Conversation with Hillary.” The first $2,700 will go to the Clinton campaign, and the remainder will do to the Democratic National Committee and state and local parties. Complete details are to be announced on Tuesday. Sources said plans were in the works for the event to take place at his home, but they were still being finalized.

 <p>
  However, he

   bowed
  </a>
  out of the event at the last minute, apparently due to a scheduling conflict.
