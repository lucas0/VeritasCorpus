  Bennett has participated in pre-game protests, and on 28 September 2017 he
  <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/28/politics/nfl-michael-bennett-national-anthem-protest-cnntv/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   spoke
  </a>
  at a CNN event about what he and the other NFL players hope to accomplish by kneeling during the anthem:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “I would like to challenge every American that is watching this show to treat people better,” said Bennett, speaking at a CNN town hall moderated by Anderson Cooper. “That really is what it’s about. It’s about treating people like human beings. That’s the first step.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “The changes start with the heart,” he continued. “This is not a violent protest. This is a peaceful protest. We are challenging people spiritually, not physically, spiritually to change the way you have been doing. Change the culture.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  However, while Bennett has kneeled in protest and although he has appealed to change the culture, he has not burned an American flag to make his point.
