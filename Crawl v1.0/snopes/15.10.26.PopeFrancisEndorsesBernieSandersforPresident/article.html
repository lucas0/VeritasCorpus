  On 26 October 2015 the web site
  <em>
   National Report
  </em>
  (and its shill site
  <em>
   USAToday.com.co
  </em>
  ) published an article reporting that Pope Francis had endorsed Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders in the U.S. presidential race:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In a final speech to the synod, Pope Francis endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States, while taking some clear swipes at conservatives who hold up church doctrine above all else, and use it to cast judgment on others.
  </p>
  <p>
   “The synod experience also made us better realize that the true defenders are not those who uphold its letter, but its spirit; not ideas but people; not formulas but free availability of God’s love and forgiveness,” Pope Francis said. “I see in Senator Bernard Sanders a man of great integrity and moral conviction, who understands these principles and genuinely wants what’s best for all people.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Although the Sanders campaign

   announced
  </a>
  in April 2016 that the Democratic hopeful had accepted an invitation to travel to the Vatican to attend a conference on social, economic and environmental issues, there is no truth to the report that His Holiness has publicly endorsed Sanders for president. The
  <em>

  is a fake news site, as is USAToday.com.co, the shill site the
  <em>
   National Report
  </em>
  uses to attempt to lend credibility to
  <em>

  ‘s fake, clickbaiting stories by reposting them to a domain mimicking that of the legitimate
  <em>
