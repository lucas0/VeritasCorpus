  A law enforcement officer said he was asked to leave a Red Cross shelter in Lafayette, Louisiana after he prayed with several flood victims.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clay Higgins, a reserve city marshal and a local legend, dropped by after work to minister to evacuees at the Heymann Performing Arts Center on Aug. 19.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was not proselytizing,” he told me. “I was just there to thank volunteers and offer prayers and encouragement.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Higgins, who is also running for Congress, was dressed in uniform and was holding a Bible.
 </p>
 <p>
  At some point during the visit a volunteer approached Higgins and mentioned there was a problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He said the Red Cross had an issue with me being there,” Higgins said. “So I asked him what the problem was. He looked down at my Bible and he gestured and said, ‘They have a problem with that.’ … I was told that the Red Cross does not allow spiritual counseling in their shelters,” he said. “The supervisor told me the Red Cross is not a religious-based organization and they don’t allow religious interaction with the residents.”
