  In June 2016, the web site
  <em>
   Global Network
  </em>
  published an article reporting that Yellowstone National Park had been evacuated due to fears of an imminent volcanic eruption:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Yellowstone National Park has been hastily evacuated as fear of the Yellowstone Caldera’s eruption is deemed to be approaching sooner than previously expected. Researchers on-site claim that the 640,000 year-old super volcano has exhibited a sudden spike of activity which indicates that it could erupt in as little as two weeks.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Global Network
  </em>
  cited the web site
  <em>
   Trending News Guide
  </em>
  as their source of the information, which in turn cited
  <em>
   Liberty First News
  </em>
  , which had cited a (now-deleted) 2014 report
  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140825025843/http://civictribune.com/yellowstone-evacuated-experts-claim-super-volcano-erupt-within-weeks/" target="_blank">
   published
  </a>
  by the
  <em>
   Civic Tribune
  </em>
  — a web site that allows users to “submit (their) own news.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Back in 2014, a Yellowstone official
  <a href="http://www.nbcmontana.com/news/yellowstone-officials-dispel-evacuation-rumors/27415338" target="_blank">
   debunked
  </a>
  the
  <em>
   Civic Tribune
  </em>
  ‘s report as completely false:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Yellowstone is not being evacuated and no, the supervolcano is not erupting. That is the message from park officials about a rumor prompting calls from people and media all over the country.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yellowstone Park Spokesman Al Nash says the rumor came from a website called Civic Tribune. He says no one has heard of the one-page website until now.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nash says the web page looks professional, but you can’t find out who the source is.  He says the park and surrounding businesses are getting many calls and emails.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to Nash, “What they said on their website, that was also a Facebook post, was that Yellowstone was evacuating because an eruption of the supervolcano was imminent. And they used a photograph of a volcanic eruption from the Phillipines in 1984 to illustrate their story.”
