  </em>
  published an article reporting that Hillary Clinton’s “health condition” should be a “major issue” of the 2016 presidential race, along with two photographs purportedly showing Clinton being helped up a flight of stairs:

   SHOCK PHOTO: Multiple staffers help unstable Hillary up stairs
  </p>
  <p>
   The questionable health condition of Hillary Clinton should be a major issue of the 2016 campaign.
  </p>
  <p>
   The latest evidence comes in the form of Clinton being helped up a set of stairs by multiple individuals outside what appears to be a home.

  The photographs received wider attention when they were shared by conservative commentator Matt Drudge on Twitter:

  While the above-displayed photographs are real, they are not the “latest evidence” of Clinton’s alleged poor health, nor are they by themselves indicative of any significant health problems. The photographs were originally published in February 2016, more than five months before they started circulating on various right-wing web sites.
