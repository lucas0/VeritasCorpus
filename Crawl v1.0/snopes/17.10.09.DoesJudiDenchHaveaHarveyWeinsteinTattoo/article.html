  A piece of Hollywood lore was recirculated on social media in October 2017 after
  <em>
   Newsweek
  </em>
  claimed that actress Judi Dench, who recently spoke out against Weinstein’s alleged

   history
  </a>
  of sexually harassing women, had a tattoo of Harvey Weinstein’s initials on her backside in a

  Reports about Dench’s Harvey Weinstein “tattoo” have been circulating since at least 2011 when the actress made a
  <a href="http://pagesix.com/2011/07/08/favorite-backer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   joke
  </a>
  about the cheeky ink while accepting a British Film Institute award in London. Page Six reported:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Oscar-winner for “Shakespeare in Love” said the former Miramax mogul gave her a break when others said she “didn’t have a face for film.” “[He] said, ‘Mrs. Brown’ should be a film,” Dench said of the 1997 project that launched her Hollywood career after Weinstein took it from the BBC to US cinemas. “It was thanks to Harvey, whose name I have had tattooed on my bum ever since.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Dench took this joke a step further when she reportedly mooned Weinstein at a New York restaurant in 2014. The actress explained in a
  <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/philomena-star-judi-dench-mooning-668045" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   Q&amp;A
  </a>
  with
  <em>
   The Hollywood Reporter
  </em>
  that she had her makeup artist draw a temporary tattoo on her backside before meeting Weinstein for dinner:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I once said to him, “I have your named tattooed on my bum.” He laughed and was, well, quite embarrassed, actually. It’s quite difficult to embarrass Harvey, but I did! And then, we went out to lunch, to the Four Seasons. Charlie Rose was there and I think my agent was there. Beforehand, I got my makeup lady to actually write Harvey’s name. [
   <em>

   </em>
   ] Then I brought it up at lunch and said, “You know, I do have it on my bum” — and then I actually got up and showed him! I’ve never seen a man more embarrassed and I’ve never let him forget it. [
   <em>
    laughs
   </em>
   ] Perhaps I should have it done and really shock him!
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Weinstein told a similar story during an appearance on
  <em>
   The Graham Norton Show,
  </em>
  although the producer appeared to be under the false impression that Dench’s tattoo was genuine:

  Dench didn’t get her first
  <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-36673739" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   tattoo
  </a>
  until the age of 81, several years after the Harvey Weinstein tattoo rumors started to circulate, when she got the words “
  <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/06/judi-dench-tattoo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   carpe diem
  </a>
  ” (seize the day) written across her wrist.
  <em>
   Vanity Fair
  </em>
  reported:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   She did not get Weinstein’s name immortally etched into her arm, though. Instead, she got the words “carpe diem” inscribed on her wrist as a gift from her daughter,
   <strong>
    Finty Williams.
   </strong>
   In an interview with
   <a href="http://www.surreylife.co.uk/home/surrey_life_magazine_interviews_dame_judi_dench_at_british_wildlife_centre_1_4487014" target="_blank">
    <em>
     Surrey Life
    </em>
   </a>
   , Dench explained the ink: “That’s my motto: seize the day. Finty gave it to me for my 81st birthday—she’s wonderful with surprises.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  As of this writing,
  <em>
   Newsweek
  </em>
  ‘s tweet incorrectly stating that Dench has a “Harvey Weinstein tattoo” on her derriere is still on Twitter, though the publication has added an update to their article:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   <em>
    This article has been updated to reflect that Judi Dench’s tattoo dedicated to Harvey Weinstein was not a permanent fixture.
   </em>
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Although Dench was close to the producer throughout much of her career, she released a
  <a href="http://people.com/movies/judi-dench-harvey-weinstein-statement/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   statement
  </a>
  on 9 October 2017 condemning Weinstein for his alleged history of sexual harassment:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “Whilst there is no doubt that Harvey Weinstein has helped and championed my film career for the past 20 years, I was completely unaware of these offences which are, of course, horrifying and I offer my sympathy to those who have suffered, and wholehearted support to those who have spoken out.”
