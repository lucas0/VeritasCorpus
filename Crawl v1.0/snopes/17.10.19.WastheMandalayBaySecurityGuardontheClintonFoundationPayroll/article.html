  In mid-October 2017, the satirical web site FreedumJunkshun posted an

  </a>
  apparently aiming to take in “

  Clinton-watchers, reporting that wounded Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos had not only “vanished,” but that he had worked for the Clinton Foundation’s Las Vegas office. Citing a fabricated quote attributed Fox News, FreedumJunkshun stated:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Then there’s this tidbit from Fox News. It’s two sentences, but they’re very interesting sentences:
  </p>
  <p>
   Until last month, Campos worked a second job at the Clinton Foundation’s Las Vegas office where he had been providing security services for more than five years.
  </p>
  <p>
   He resigned suddenly just before the attacks.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Under FreedomJunkshun’s “about” section, the web site clearly indicates is not intended to be taken seriously:
 </p>
 <blockquote>

   We believe that there is nothing more precious than the mind of an aging conservative. Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate. Reality is often in the eye of the beholder. You won’t find any of it here.

 </blockquote>
 <p>
  We confirmed with the Clinton Foundation that they have no office in Las Vegas, and no current or past employees named Jesus Campos.

  Campos accidentally attracted the addled obsession of conspiracy theorists when he was shot in the leg while inspecting a reported open door on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on 1 October 2017. He was wounded in a hail of gunfire when mass shooter Stephen Paddock turned his weapon on the hallway before raining bullets down on a country music festival crowd of 22,000 below.

  Campos has been credited as a hero for his life-saving

  that night, which included warning a building engineer and a hotel guest to take cover, and helping police despite his injury until they ordered him to seek medical care. However his high-profile role in a mass shooting has inevitably resulted in intense scrutiny from a demented segment of the U.S. population known as “truthers,’ who believe

  Since the mass shooting in which Paddock killed 58 people and wounded hundreds, Campos has been the target of much delusional speculation, including false allegations that he was an “

  Ending hyperbolic reports he had “vanished” while attempting to maintain a low profile, the soft-spoken Campos
