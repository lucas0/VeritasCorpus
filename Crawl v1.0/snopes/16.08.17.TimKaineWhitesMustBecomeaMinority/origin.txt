  I was in Honduras, struck with the MLK reference, “the most segregated hour of the week is

  morning.”  And that was a challenge to me.  And so I’ve made my spiritual home in a neighborhood where we’re not segregated.  In fact, we were, when we started there, one of a few white families in that church.  It’s now a very well-integrated church.  But it was important to — especially I think the burden is on those of us who are in a majority — Caucasians, here.  We’ve got to put ourselves in situations where we’re in the minority and come to understand a reality that’s different than the one that we just take for granted every day.  We have to.

  I have often — I learned this in Honduras, and I have learned it again in Richmond, just from my perspective, which is not an omniscient one, but just from my perspective, that if you are in a minority in this country, you kind of have to learn the ways of the majority just to survive, just to survive.  But if you’re in a majority, you can go through your whole life and not have to learn the ways of anybody other than you.  And that’s not — that’s not saying that there’s malice there, but you can just be walled off, separated, segregated on the other side of town and move with people like you and never have to grapple with a reality that’s different than your own.  And one of the beautiful things that has been transformational about my church is that by being there, I’ve had to grapple with, understand, listen to, learn from, confront realities that are not necessarily the ones that were my own but over time have become more a part of me.
