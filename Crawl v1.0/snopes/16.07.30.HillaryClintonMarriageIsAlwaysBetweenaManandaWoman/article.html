  As former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton edged closer to the Democratic Party’s nomination in 2016, an image macro reflecting her views about same-sex marriage, as she expressed them back in 2000, spiked in popularity. Using an old photograph of Clinton and including the hashtag #tbt (typically “throwback Thursday”), the image macro quoted Clinton as saying: “I think a marriage is as a marriage has always been, between a man and a woman.”

  The quote was fairly easy to authenticate, given the attention now paid to Clinton’s “evolved” stance on marriage equality. A 2013

  a longer version of the same remark:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Marriage has historic, religious and moral content that goes back to the beginning of time, and I think a marriage is as a marriage has always been, between a man and a woman.

  Clinton’s response to an August 2007 question had her expressing support for civil unions but still not same-sex marriage:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Well, I prefer to think of it as being very positive about civil unions. You know, it’s a personal position. How we get to full equality is the debate we’re having, and I am absolutely in favor of civil unions with full equality of benefits, rights, and privileges.

  In 2011, when the state of New York legalized same-sex marriage, Clinton (then serving as secretary of state)

   spoke

  to the crowd at a  gay-pride celebration and hailed the “historic vote in New York [that] gives such visibility and credibility to everything that so many of you have done over so many years.”   Although she proclaimed that “I’ve always believed that we would make progress because we were on the right side of equality and justice,” Clinton remained officially on the record as opposing same-sex marriage.

  Clinton’s full “flop” on the issue didn’t occur until March

  , when she openly embraced marriage equality. Political science professor Paul Kengor noted at the time that Hillary Clinton had finally “endorsed gay marriage,” stating that he believed she had undergone “an honest shift”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   [Her position] changed this week, when the Human Rights Campaign, a gay-rights group with which Clinton has personal ties, posted a video where Clinton came out in favor of gay marriage. The timing comes as the U.S. Supreme Court readies to hear two major cases dealing with gay marriage. “LGBT Americans are our colleagues, our teachers, our soldiers, our friends, our loved ones, and they are full and equal citizens and deserve the rights of citizenship,” said Clinton. “That includes gay marriage.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Alas, here we are: Hillary Clinton has endorsed gay marriage.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some will charge that Clinton has embraced gay marriage out of political opportunism, that she sees the direction her party is moving on this issue, and therefore looking ahead to the 2016 presidential race, there’s no way she would oppose gay marriage.
  </p>
  <p>
   Perhaps there may be some truth some of the claims, but I interpret her position as steadily evolving on this issue. It’s an honest shift, one that thrills liberals.
