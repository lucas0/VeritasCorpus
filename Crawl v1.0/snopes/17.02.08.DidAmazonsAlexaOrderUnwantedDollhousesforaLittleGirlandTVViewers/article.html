  In early 2017 several news outlets

   reported

  on a story that owners of Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant device owners were “left out of pocket” after a 6-year-old girl named Brooke Neitzel inadvertently triggered one into placing an order for an expensive dollhouse, and a news report on the incident triggered a plague of automated, unwanted dollhouse ordering:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   [In January 2017] it was reported that an Amazon Echo in Dallas, Texas, had ordered a $170 dollhouse after six-year-old Brooke Neitzel asked: ‘Can you play dollhouse with me and get me a dollhouse?’

  , Neitzel’s mother Megan provided the Alexa log showing that her daughter had asked the device “Can you play dollhouse with me and get me a dollhouse?” But the embedded video of the log suggested that instead of confirming a dollhouse order, Alexa had responded, “Sorry, I couldn’t find the answer to your question”:
