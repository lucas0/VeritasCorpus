  Hunting is in my blood. My dad and uncles hunted. I didn’t hunt much as a teenager though I longed to. The thing inside me that drives me to go out and hunt is very animal. But the remorse, emotion and respect I feel, and the closeness to God that I feel when I’m out there, is my humanity. “My wife’s] like, ‘You’re not gonna eat it.’ I’m like, ‘Yeah, I guess you’re right. I just like to kill ’em. I’m sorry, but any time I kill something, I like to say a quick prayer — just cause we didn’t waste this guy.
