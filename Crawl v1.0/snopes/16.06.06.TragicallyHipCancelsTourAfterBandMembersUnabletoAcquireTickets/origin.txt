  The Tragically Hip has announced that it will be cancelling its final national tour as the members of the band were unable to acquire tickets to any of the 15 events they were set to perform at.
 </p>
 <p>
  The group made the announcement after it became clear that TicketMaster had already sold the band’s backstage passes to scalpers and was unable to purchase them back at a reasonable price.

  “$3,500 just to see myself perform!” said Gord Downie, looking at the prices on StubHub. “And that’s in US dollars?!”
