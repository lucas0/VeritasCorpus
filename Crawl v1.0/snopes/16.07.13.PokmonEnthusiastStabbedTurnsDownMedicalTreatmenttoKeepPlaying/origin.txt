 <p>
  Early Monday morning, Baker was walking near 19th and Filbert in Forest Grove to catch as many Pokémon as possible when he saw another man, possibly playing the same game.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I saw him go by and asked if he was playing Pokémon Go. He was like ‘what?’ I guess he wanted to battle because he came up at me with a knife,” said Baker.
 </p>
 <p>
  Baker said he didn’t go to the hospital because he still wanted to hunt for Pokémon and other things.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Right after I was stabbed, I continued my mission to Plaid Pantry for my mission for chips and beer,” said Baker.
