  On 13 February 2017, Fox News published a story appearing to report that “Happy Days”

   actor
  </a>
  Scott Baio announced he would boycott retail chain Nordstrom because he was unhappy with its decision to drop the clothing line of President Donald Trump’s daughter, Ivanka:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Actor Scott Baio, a known President Donald Trump supporter, said on Twitter that he is dropping Nordstrom after the department store dropped ties with Ivanka Trump.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though the retailer cited declining sales, the move coincided with calls for a boycott against stores that carry any products related to the Trump family.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the tweet, Baio included a photo of his store statement, showing he had spent more than $30,000 this past year at Nordstrom.

  Unhappy with being the butt of South African comedian and “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah’s joke, Baio responded, “When you, @Trevornoah learn what it means to be an American then you’ll have a say. Until then enjoy our $ and shut your pie-hole!”

  The flap prompted
  <em>
   Huffington Post
  </em>
  blogger David Fagin to write a satirical

   post

  reporting that the mall chain best known for selling clothing and cosmetics was going under, thanks entirely to Baio’s boycott:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Retailers who think they can do whatever they want with their brands, and not have to answer to washed-up teenage heartthrobs, better think again.
  </p>
  <p>
   Within minutes of former child star, Scott Baio, announcing that both he, and his wife, would no longer shop at Nordstrom, due to what they believe is a politically motivated boycott of his fantasy wife, Ivanka Trump, the nation’s top retailer announced plans to file for Chapter 11 protection…
  </p>
  <p>
   A loss of such magnitude shook the stock market as well, as the Dow dropped nearly 400 points, sending Wall Street reeling, after what is now hashtagging as #BaioWatch. Tomorrow’s front page of The Retail Times reads simply, “Charles is in charge of Nordstrom.”
  </p>
  <p>
   This many store closings will obviously mean the loss of thousands of jobs, but many soon-to-be former Nordstrom employees say they aren’t worried. “I’m a cosmetologist by trade,” said Joyce Stewart, a sixty-eight year-old Nordstrom veteran of twenty-one years, “but I’ve always dreamt of working with my hands, sixteen/seventeen hours a day in a heavy-lifting, menial labor type of job. I see this as a sign to finally do what I love, and that means helping to build a wall around Mexico.”

  While some apparently thought the post was straight news, it was clearly labeled “satire” at the top. A spokeswoman for Nordstrom confirmed to us that the retailer is not filing for bankruptcy.
