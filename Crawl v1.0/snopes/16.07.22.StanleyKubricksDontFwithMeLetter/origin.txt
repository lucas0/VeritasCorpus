  Dear James,
 </p>
 <p>
  It has come to my attention that you and your studio are considering producing a sequel to “2001: A Space Odyssey” over my objections. My attorney informs me that you hold the option and, legally, there is little I can do to stop you.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, I’d like you to know that I own the tapir bone prop from 2001 – the one “Moonwatcher” throws into the sky. If you attempt to make a sequel, I will cram that femur up your so ass so far, it will take an undiscovered alien super-intelligence to figure out how to dislodge it. Seriously, don’t fuck with me.
 </p>
 <p>
  Best regards,
