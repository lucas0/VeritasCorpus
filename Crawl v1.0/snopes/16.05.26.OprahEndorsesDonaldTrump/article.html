  In May 2016, an image purportedly featuring a quote from Oprah Winfrey in which she endorsed Donald Trump for president started circulating on social media:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I believe Donald Trump will be the best president of my lifetime.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  In addition to the word “parody” in the upper left corner of the above-displayed image, we found no record of Oprah ever saying this or anything like it. While the image was frequently circulated without any indication of where or when Oprah had said that she endorsed Donald Trump, other posts on Facebook claimed that the talk show host said it during a 1988 interview:

  But Oprah didn’t endorse Donald Trump for president in the above video. While the talk show host asked Trump if he planned on running for president, she never expressed whether she thought that might be a good idea.  While Oprah has not endorsed Trump for president, her name has come up talks about being the running

  for the Republican candidate:

 <blockquote>

   In June 2015, Trump himself told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that he wanted Oprah as his running mate. “I think we’d win easily, actually,” he said. “I like Oprah. I mean, is that supposed to be a bad thing? I don’t think so.”

  Oprah has not voiced her support for a 2016 presidential candidate as of May 2016. However, it should be noted that she
