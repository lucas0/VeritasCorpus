  A photograph purportedly showing a “Boombox” cartoon by Dixon Diaz is frequently circulated on the internet along with the claim that the
  <em>
   Los Angeles Times
  </em>
  stopped publishing the strip after the comic insulted Democratic politicians such as Hillary Clinton and President Obama:

  The comic displayed here was never published in the
  <em>
   Los Angeles Times.
  </em>
  This is a parody of a comic strip called
  <em>
   The Boondocks
  </em>
  , created by writer and illustrator Aaron McGruder.  (That’s why “with apologies to Aaron McGruder” appears on the right-hand side of the strip.)

  The “Boombox” parody has been circulating on the internet since at least 2013, when it was published alongside several other variations:

  These parodies were later circulated along with the claim that the
  <em>
   Los Angeles Times
  </em>
  stopped publishing “Boombox” due to its political commentary. Of course, this is not the case, as these comics never appeared in the newspaper. The original comic strip talked about bird flu:
