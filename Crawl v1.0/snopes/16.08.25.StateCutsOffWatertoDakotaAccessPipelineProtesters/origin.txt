<blockquote>
 <p>
  The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers accusing the federal agency of violating the National Historic Preservation Act and other laws after it issued final permits for a crude oil pipeline stretching from North Dakota to Illinois.
 </p>
 <p>
  The tribe, based in Fort Yates, N.D., with members also in South Dakota, is seeking an injunction to stay the pipeline’s construction until its case can be heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Represented by Earthjustice, the tribe filed the lawsuit in federal court in Washington D.C
 </p>
 <p>
  The tribe said in the filing that the “Corps effectively wrote off the tribe’s concerns and ignored the pipeline’s impacts to sacred sites and culturally important landscapes” as the pipeline travels through the tribe’s ancestral lands and passes within half a mile of its current reservation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Corps’ approval of the permit allows Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners to dig the Dakota Access pipeline under the Missouri River a half-mile upstream of the reservation and the tribe’s drinking water supply.
 </p>
 <p>
  An oil spill at this site, said the complaint, would also constitute a threat to the tribe’s culture and way of life.
