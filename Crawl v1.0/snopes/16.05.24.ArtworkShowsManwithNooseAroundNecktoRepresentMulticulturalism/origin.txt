  Tropical Depression refers to a kind of internal weather system combining melancholy and a sense of hopefulness. Tropical Depression is a lush depression one wallows in and holds in itself a kind of promise and optimism.

  Each of the sculptures are a combination of realistic figuration and the surreal. Life scale and wearing the artist’s clothes, the sculptures possess an uncanny presence. Each of the sculptures’ titles begin with the phrase “All my problems are water based . . .” evoking ongoing themes in Kunath’s work of homesickness, melancholia, and addiction. The line between nurturing and excess become blurred with images of a man engorging himself on a giant strawberry or watering a tree connected to a noose.
