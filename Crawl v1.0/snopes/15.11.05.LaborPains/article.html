  On 5 September 2015, the entertainment Facebook group “Stop the World, The Teabaggers Want Off” posted an image of Wisconsin governor (and GOP presidential hopeful) Scott Walker along with a fictitious quotation ostensibly uttered by him about unions and Labor Day:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Labor Unions don’t deserve to have a national holiday. They’ve done more damage to our economy than any recession ever did. Labor Day should be replaced by Patriots Day, celebrated every year on 9/11.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  While Scott Walker has made battling labor unions a hallmark of his political career, the above-displayed quote was not uttered by him. The “Stop The World, The Teabaggers Want Off” Facebook group describes itself as a satire page,

   noting
  </a>
  that none of the material it publishes should be taken seriously:
 </p>
 <blockquote>

  Conservative politicians are frequently targeted by this Facebook group, with recent memes mocking
