  In August 2015, a video claiming that episodes of the Fox animated series
  <em>
   The Simpsons
  </em>
  had made some eerily accurate predictions about future events began circulating via social media. Most notable among those predictions was a clip purportedly taken from a 2000 episode that showed business magnate Donald Trump announcing his candidacy for President of the United States:

  While the above-displayed video touches on a wide variety of
  <em>
   Simpsons
  </em>
  related conspiracy theories, the main issue was highlighted in September 2015 with a photograph — one that not only documented that
  <em>
   The Simpsons
  </em>
  had depicted Donald Trump running for President back in 2000, but that they did so by showing him in a setting and pose (riding an escalator while waving to supporters and onlookers) identical to one he would assume fifteen years later:

  The images from
  <i>
   The Simpsons
  </i>
  shown on the left-hand side of the above-displayed graphic did not originate in 2000, however. They were taken from a short video entitled “Trumpastic Voyage,” which was posted to the “Animation Domination” YouTube channel page on

   7 July

  2015, after Trump had announced that he would be seeking the Republican presidential nomination for 2016:

  The animated series did feature a joke about Donald Trump’s becoming president in a 2000 episode entitled “Bart to the Future,” but since Trump had been

   flirting

  with the idea of making a presidential run since at least as far back as 1999, such a “prediction” wasn’t as prescient as it might seem in retrospect:

  Another
  <em>
   Simpsons
  </em>
  -related prediction theory was floated on 9 November 2016, a day after Trump won the presidential election, holding that the show had correctly predicted the 2016 electoral vote map:

  This screenshot of Mr. Burns and a dog kneeling in front of an electoral map is real, but it has little to do with Donald Trump — it was taken from a 2012 clip in which the greedy billionaire of Springfield endorsed Republican candidate Mitt Romney:

  Furthermore, this
  <em>
   Simpsons
  </em>
  screenshot is being compared to an electoral map that does not match the genuine map of the 2016 presidential election. When the screenshot is compared to the
  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/president" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   real
  </a>
  2016 electoral map, it’s clear they are not identical. For instance,
  <em>
   The Simpsons “
  </em>
  predicted” that Wisconsin, Ohio, and Pennsylvania would be blue (these were all red states), and that Virginia would be red (a blue state) in 2016:
