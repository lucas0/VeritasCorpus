   An expunged conviction doesn’t really matter in the world of immigration. It’s still an issue on your record. In fact a lot of people have to go back and get previously-expunged crimes un-expunged when they apply for naturalization because the immigration agency needs to see what that crime was and whether or not it renders you ineligible to apply for naturalization.
