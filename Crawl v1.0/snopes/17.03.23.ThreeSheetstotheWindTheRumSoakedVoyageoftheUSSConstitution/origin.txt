  The following is an account of USS Constitution’s famous war cruise during the War of 1812. In August, Constitution set sail from Boston with 475 officers and men — about the same complement as one of our Aegis cruisers today — and the following supplies:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   48,000 gallons of fresh water
  </li>
  <li>
   7,400 cannon shot
  </li>
  <li>
   11,000 pounds of black powder and…
  </li>
  <li>
   79,400 gallons of rum.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Upon arriving in Jamaica on 6 October, she took on:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   826 pounds of flour and…
  </li>
  <li>
   69,300 gallons of rum.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  She then headed for the Azores, where she took on
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   550 tons of beef and…
  </li>
  <li>
   64,000 gallons of Portuguese wine.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  On 13 November she set sail for England. In the ensuing days, she defeated 5 British men of war and sank 12 British merchant ships, salvaging only their rum.
 </p>
 <p>
  By 27 January, her powder and shot were exhausted. Nonetheless, she made a raid on the Firth of Clyde. Her landing party captured a whiskey distillery and transferred 40,000 gallons of scotch aboard. She then headed home.
 </p>
 <p>
  Constitution made port at Boston harbor on the 23rd of February with no cannon shot, no powder, no food, no rum, no whiskey, no wine — but with 48,000 gallons of stagnant water!
