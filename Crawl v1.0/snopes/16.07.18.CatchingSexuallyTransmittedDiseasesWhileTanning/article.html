  According to long-standing rumors, tanning beds can be dangerous — not just because the ultraviolet light can potentially deliver a nasty burn to your skin, but because they purportedly can be vectors for various viruses and bacteria. The possibility has spawned a plethora of stories that are long on scares but relatively short on

    Dermatologist Dawn Marie Davies, an associate professor of dermatology at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, warns the virus, and other bacteria, can survive on tanning beds, despite the heat.

  possible, in theory, to pick up sexually transmitted infections such as herpes from tanning beds, because the ultraviolet light doesn’t necessarily kill viruses or bacteria (and many people slip into the beds nude without cleaning them first), and overexposure to UV rays can depress the immune

  “As you can imagine, this issue varies greatly by type of infection and the conditions outside the body,” Brian Katzowitz from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told us:

   Although studies have demonstrated that some STDs (eg, herpes virus) can survive on some surfaces or in water, or that some STDs (e.g, trichomonasis) can survive for up to 45 minutes on toilet seats, wash cloths, clothing and in bath water, transmission of such STDs is overwhelmingly by direct genital contact.

  However, even if you’re not guaranteed a case of the clap with your tan, it’s always best practice to wipe down the tanning bed before and after each use, or to not use tanning booths at all.  While the risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease from a tanning salon or a sunlamp may be infinitesimal, the risk of burns, blisters, and skin cancer is not: melanoma risks increase dramatically with indoor
