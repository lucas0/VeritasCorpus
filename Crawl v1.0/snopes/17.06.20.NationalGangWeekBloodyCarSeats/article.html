  Messages circulated in late 2009 warned about gangs engaging in a “National Gang Week” scheme of using bloody car seats as lures to trick unsuspecting female motorists out of their cars, then beating and raping them:

   National Gang Week is starting:  This is their New target Method While driving on any roads, If you see a baby car seat sitting on the side of the road DO NOT STOP!!!! These are gangs targeting people, especially women, to stop their vehicle to help a baby. They make this baby look as if it has blood on itself or on its clothes, when you get out of your vehicle in attempt to help, the gangs jump out from cornfields or tall bushes. They have beaten women to near death, and then continue to rape them with baseball bats and other torture methods. This is not just a forward of information, it is within our area. If you do happen to see a car seat DO NOT STOP CALL THE POLICE IMMEDIATELY!! Please send this on to everyone you know.

   On the way to Canton, driving on Michigan Avenue, on Thursday morning, I saw an infant car seat on the side of the road with a blanket draped over it.  I did not stop, even though I had all kinds of thoughts running through my head.  But when I got to my destination, I called the Canton PD and they were going to check it out.  This is what I was told…
  </p>
  <p>
   “Several things to be aware of .. gangs and thieves, are now plotting different ways to get a person to “stop” their vehicle.
  </p>
  <p>
   “There is a gang initiation reported by the local police department that gangs are placing a car seat by the road…with a fake baby in
   <br/>
   it…waiting for a woman, of course, to stop and check on the baby.  Note that the location of this car seat will usually be beside a wooded or grassy (field) area …and the person – woman – will be dragged into the woods- beaten and raped- usually left for dead.   DO NOT STOP.

    DIAL 9-1-1
   </nobr>
   AND REPORT WHAT YOU SAW.
  </p>

   “IF YOU ARE DRIVING AT NIGHT AND EGGS ARE THROWN AT YOUR WINDSHIELD. DO NOT OPERATE THE WIPER AND DO NOT SPRAY ANY WATER BECAUSE EGGS MIXED WITH WATER BECOME MILKY AND BLOCK YOUR VISION UP TO 92.5%  YOU ARE THEN FORCED TO STOP BESIDE THE ROAD AND BECOME A VICTIM OF THIEVES. THIS IS A NEW TECHNIQUE USED BY GANGS. PLEASE INFORM YOUR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES.  THESE ARE DESPERATE TIMES AND THESE UNSAVORY INDIVIDUALS WILL TAKE DESPERATE MEASURES TO GET WHAT THEY WANT.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Please talk to your loved ones about this.  This is a new tactic used and I would hate for anyone to fall victim to this kind of crime.

  These warnings carried all the hallmarks of numerous other gang-related urban legends:
  <br/>
  <ul>
   <br/>
   <li>
    Gangs throughout the U.S. participate in some sort of organized nationwide scheme to engage in mayhem during a designated time period (e.g., the “
    <a href="halloween.asp" target="hall">
     Halloween
    </a>
    gang initiation” legend).
   </li>
  </ul>
 </p>
 <p>
  <li>
   Gangs regularly target random, innocent victims for murder, typically as part of an initiation scheme for new members (e.g., the “
   <a href="/crime/gangs/pullover.asp" target="flash">
    flashing headlights
   </a>
   ” legend).
  </li>
 </p>
 <p>
  <li>
   Gangs engage in a variety of schemes to lure random motorists out of their cars in order to beat, rob, or kill them (e.g., placing tire-puncturing

   </a>

   </a>
   or had been struck by other cars, or hurling

   or other objects at automobiles).
  </li>
 </p>
 <p>
  <li>
   Gangs particularly target random, innocent (usually white) women (e.g.,

   shoppers and
   <a href="/crime/gangs/genesee.asp" target="gas">
