  [Hillary] had accepted an exciting job opportunity in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at the organization Marian Wright Edelman had recently founded, the Children’s Defense Fund. When Bill and Hillary parted after her brief stay in Arkansas, their situation seemed totally unsettled.

 <p>
  Not long thereafter, on July 23 and 24, Hillary took the D.C. bar exam, according to records of the District of Columbia Bar Association. In Cambridge, she rented rooms not far from the Harvard campus. It was the first time in her life she had lived alone. She didn’t like it.

 <p>
  On November 3, the District of Columbia Bar Association notified Hillary that she had failed the bar exam. For the first time in her life, she had flamed
  <nobr>
   out — spectacularly,
  </nobr>
  given the expectations of others for her, and even more so on her own. Of
  <nobr>
   817 applicants,
  </nobr>
  <nobr>

  </nobr>
  her peers had passed, most from law schools less prestigious than Yale. She kept this news hidden for the next thirty years. She never took the exam again, despite many opportunities.  Her closest friends and associates were flabbergasted when she made the revelation in a single throwaway line in

 <p>
  Those who knew her best speculated that she must have felt deep shame at her failure, and that her self-confidence — always so visible a part of her
  <nobr>
   exterior — was
  </nobr>
  shattered by the experience (though many first-rate lawyers, even Yale Law graduates, had flunked the bar on their first try).
