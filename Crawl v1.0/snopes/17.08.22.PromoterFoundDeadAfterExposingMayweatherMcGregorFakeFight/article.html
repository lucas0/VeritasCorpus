  On 21 August 2017, the web site NewsPunch
  <em>
  </em>
  <a href="https://archive.is/jnBaX" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   published
  </a>
  a fake news article claiming that Barry Gibson, a boxing promoter, was killed for revealing that the upcoming boxing match between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Connor McGreggor is fixed:

   A boxing promoter who had been working on the upcoming Mayweather-McGregor bout, was found dead within hours of warning the fight is fixed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Barry Gibson was found dead in his hometown of Washington D.C. in what has the hallmarks of an execution-style killing, hours after blowing the lid on the Mayweather-McGregor fight backstage at a press conference in Toronto, Canada.

  is the new home for
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/tag/yournewswire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   YourNewsWire
  </a>
  , a disreputable web site that has garnered a reputation for publishing misinformation. Despite the new name, it seems that NewsPunch is continuing with the shoddy journalistic practices.
 </p>
 <p>
  NewsPunch’s Gibson article is illustrated with unrelated photographs. For instance, the featured image was swiped from a story about the

   2002

  D.C. sniper attack.

  </em>
  photographer Bill O’Leary took the

  , which shows a police officer near a the body of woman

   killed
  </a>
  in the attack. The caption reads:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Bill O’Leary / twp Five people shot dead, apparently at random and with frightening precision, over a 16 hour period in various Montgomery county locations within close proximity to each other. Pictured, a police officer takes measurements in front of the remains of a hispanic woman killed on a bench in front of a fast food restaurant (crisp^n juicy) near a post office in Leisure World plaza, on Georgia avenue.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  NewsPunch
  <em>
  </em>
  also made a few logical errors. For instance, while the photograph shows a dead body on a bench, the text of the article claimed that Gibson had been killed in his Jeep.
 </p>
 <p>
  The web site also claimed that Gibson worked with Mayweather Productions, but we found no mention of a
  <a href="http://mayweatherpromotions.com/about/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   promoter
  </a>
  with that name on their web site. In fact, we have not been able to locate a boxing promoter named Barry Gibson at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  NewsPunch
  <em>
  </em>
  also claimed that
  <em>
   The Washington Post
  </em>
  had published (then quickly deleted) a story about Gibson’s death headlined “Boxing promoter, 44, found shot dead in ‘execution-style’ in D.C.” and included an image of the supposed article:

  <p>
   I can tell you that we never published any story about a boxing promoter being executed in DC in connection with the Mayweather-McGregor fight.
