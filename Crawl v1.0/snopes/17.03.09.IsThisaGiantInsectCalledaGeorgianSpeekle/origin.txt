  Last year in Georgia, a homeowner got the fright of their life when they found this spiky, cylinder-shaped monster skulking in their garage. It was about two-feet-long, with sharp spikes around its edges, but no eyes were visible. It later appeared in more Georgian homes, causing a lot of fear. Experts were called, who said it wasn’t poisonous, but they couldn’t give much more information as they’d never seen the breed before. They named it the ‘Georgian Speekle’.
