   Allan Jones, CEO of Check Into Cash and suit maker Hardwick Clothes, said his companies “will not condone unpatriotic behavior.” More than 200 NFL [National Football League] players conducted protests during the national anthem last Sunday after President Trump called on the league’s owners to fire anyone who kneels during the pregame ceremony.

  In a subsequent interview with Fox Business’s Stuart Varney, Jones added that the removal of the advertisements would last for at least the remainder of the current season.

  It’s not clear how much NFL-related advertising expenditure had been slated by Jones’s companies this season. A representative for his management company was not immediately available for comment.
