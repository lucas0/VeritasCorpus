  On 6 December 2017, President Donald Trump announced a shift in foreign policy under which the U.S. would officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and he set in motion a plan to move the American Embassy to that city from Tel Aviv.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although President Trump’s Jerusalem announcement had broad support across the U.S., it also drew criticism and protests from many Americans, from U.S. allies, and from the Arab world:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Islamist group Hamas urged Palestinians to abandon peace efforts and launch a new uprising against Israel in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as its capital.
  </p>
  <p>
   Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy by recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, angering the Arab world and upsetting Western allies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The status of Jerusalem, home to sites considered holy to Muslims, Jews and Christians, is one of the biggest obstacles to a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
  </p>
  <p>
   “We should call for and we should work on launching an intifada (Palestinian uprising) in the face of the Zionist enemy,” Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said in a speech in Gaza.
