  In March 2016, a video appeared that purportedly showed Secret Service agents
  <span style="line-height: 1.6471;">
   driving a limousine in reverse at high speeds on a racetrack:

  The video was frequently shared along with the claim that it showed Secret Service agents training for “advanced reverse escapes.” A video posted to the Vomitorium Facebook page racked up more than 28 million views within two days of its initial posting.

 <p>
  This video, however, does not show anyone from the Secret Service training on a racetrack. The footage actually comes from a racing video
  <a href="http://www.forzamotorsport.net/en-us/games/fm6" target="_blank">
   game
  </a>
  called
  <em>
   Forza Motorsport 6
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  The original video was uploaded on 8 March 2016 to a YouTube
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4BEiuqPdmsRHjS8LbhUmWg" target="_blank">
   channel
  </a>
  that also features several other videos from the
  <i>
   Forza
  </i>
  series. This particular

  originally included an intro that clearly identified it as video game footage:

   agents
  </a>
  (and others) are given tactical driving courses as part of their training, much of which does take place on a
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HtvEa1nIxA" target="_blank">
   track
  </a>
  or an obstacle course and
  <a href="https://www.fletc.gov/training-program/protective-service-operations-training-program" target="_blank">
   includes
  </a>
  route surveying, motorcade driving, and evasion techniques.  However, it’s unlikely that the training would be done in the Presidential limousine, and if it was that there would be a sizable audience (as there is in the above video) watching the course without much of a protective barrier.
