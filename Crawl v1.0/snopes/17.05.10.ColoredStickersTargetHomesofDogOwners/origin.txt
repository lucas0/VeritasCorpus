 <p>
  Any dog owners beware, leaflet droppers or anyone walking around housing estates.
  <br>
   Keep your eye out for small coloured STICKERS on gates or doors, gangs are marking how many dogs live there to steal and they are using them for DOG BAIT FOR FIGHTING.
   <br/>
   Ring the police immediately if you see any and inform the home owners.
   <br/>
   Remove the stickers immediately!
   <br/>
   Red stickers are for big dogs
   <br/>
   Yellow for medium and
   <br/>
   Pink for small breeds
   <br/>
   Please re-share and keep your dog safe!
   <br/>
   This is already happening in the Goole Yorkshire area, UK and could be spreading across the country. This is disgusting
