    Kid Tells Mall Santa A Secret; Seconds Later Him And His Elves Are Beating Up Child Molester
   </br>
  </p>
  <p>
   Greendale, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. As busy shoppers rush around buying Christmas gifts for their loved ones inside the giant Southridge Mall, a group of men are being arrested by mall security and local police for affray.
  </p>
  <p>
   But this was no normal scuffle between gangs or a skirmish over the last iPads in stock before the big day. The fight involved SANTA CLAUS and his elves. Well, a mall Santa and his dwarf colleagues, at any rate. They weren’t fighting among themselves, though. They were beating the cr*p out of a CHILD MOLESTER.
  </p>
  <p>
   66 year-old Nicholas Cooper was taken into custody for assaulting Kris Kane, 38, after an unnamed young girl confided in him. She said that she ‘wanted to tell Santa a secret’ and that ‘all she wanted was for her stepdad to stop touching her at night’.

  For one thing, there is no record of this incident taking place that was published anywhere but viral and hoax news web site. Furthermore, the included pictures were stolen from previous incidents (a common tactic for fake news organizations) and do not show a mall Santa named “Nicholas Cooper” as he is being arrested for beating up “Kris Kane.” The picture of “Santa” getting
