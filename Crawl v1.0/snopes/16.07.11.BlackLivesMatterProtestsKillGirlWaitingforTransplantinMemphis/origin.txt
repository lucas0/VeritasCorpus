  Protest in Memphis…Will blow your mind….Just learned that a little 12 year old girl was waiting for a heart transplant-time being very crucial. But the interstate was closed down due to the protest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her timeline was at a critical state and minutes totally mattered. She had a 45 minute window to receive the transplant, which would have undoubtedly saved her life. But with the interstate being closed down, “Black Lives Matter”, she tragically expired.
 </p>
 <p>
  Very sad. The protest completely shut down the interstate and gave her no hope to live. Oh, forgot to mention, she was African-American.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, tell me, do you think her life mattered????
