  The key to the LASIK@
  <em>
   Home
  </em>
  system is the
  <strong>
   Scal-Pal™ Scanning Adjusting Laparascopic Personal Laser
  </strong>
  . This hand-operated combination femtosecond/excimer laser is made exclusively for LASIK@
  <em>
   Home
  </em>
  by Walton Group Manufacturing, the same company that makes the the LASIK equipment used by more clinics nationwide.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Scal-Pal™ is actually two lasers in one! First the Scal-Pal™
  <em>
   femtosecond
  </em>
  laser cuts a small flap in the cornea of your eye. Then the
  <em>
   excimer
  </em>
  laser vaporizes a tiny section of the lens without damaging the surrounding tissue. The whole procedure takes only a few minutes and is virtually painless.*
