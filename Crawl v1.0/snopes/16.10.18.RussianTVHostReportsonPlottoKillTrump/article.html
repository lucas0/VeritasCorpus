  On 14 September 2016, Infowars host Alex Jones devoted a segment to what he described as the revelation of a plot to kill Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. In truth, the segment was

   a re-airing
  </a>
  of a commentary that same day on Russian state television by host Dmitry Kiselyov:

  Both Jones and Kiselyov said on their broadcasts that Trump was leading Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the polls that day, but neither cited a specific poll to bolster their claims (although Trump did lead the former secretary of state at the time in Florida, Nevada, and Ohio according to a Bloomberg Politics

  released the same day showed Clinton leading nationally by five percentage points.
 </p>
 <p>
  In his commentary entitled “Will they kill Trump?,” Kiselyov said Trump’s performance at the polls, along with his “intentions to turn over a new leaf regarding the Russian-American relations” and “ability to speak boldly” had put him in a dangerous position. According to voiceover translation from Infowars, Kiselyov reported:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Now they can just just kill him. The intelligence services of the United States are not interested in the type of president Trump vows to be, because the contrived enemy in the form of Russia justifies their existence. American elites are not interested in a ‘President Trump’ as the establishment world order provides them with reliable sources of lucrative business. Trump, on the other hand, who is ready to reach agreements, would bring about a different set of financial opportunities, flowing in other directions.

  of the same section:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Now they may just kill him. The U.S. special services do not need such a president. Those services promote hatred toward Russia in order to justify their existence. The American oligarchs also do not need such a president. For these oligarchs, the existing world order ensures solid and stable business. For them, a Trump who is ready to settle issues with Russia means that the finances will flow in a different direction.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  While providing no specific information regarding any attempts on Trump’s life, Kiselyov did cite a 4 March 2016
  <a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2016/03/04/does-a-jfk-rfk-mlk-moment-await-trump/" target="_blank">
   op-ed piece
  </a>
  by Stephen Lendman published on a blog belonging to Paul Craig Roberts, who served as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy. Lendman mused that the assassinations of both John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy were “inside jobs” and wondered whether Trump was heading for a similar fate:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Are long knives planning Trump’s removal? Is he being set up for elimination? Has a date, location and convenient patsy to be blamed for his demise been chosen?
  </p>
  <p>
   Maybe an unfortunate plane crash, other fatal accident, or mysterious incurable, fast-acting deadly illness is planned.
  </p>
  <p>
   Will Trump be gone before Republicans choose their nominee in July, or perhaps before November’s election?
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Lendman did not offer any specific evidence that the former reality TV host was under any immediate threat. A British national, 20-year-old Michael Sandford, was
  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/19/politics/trump-rally-gun-police-officer/index.html" target="_blank">
   arrested
  </a>
  on 19 June 2016 for allegedly trying to take a police officer’s gun in order to shoot and kill Trump, but

   pleaded guilty
  </a>
  in connection with the incident on 13 September 2016, a day before Kiselyov’s commentary aired.

 <p>
  While not offering any proof to back up Lendman’s views, Kiselyov has

Also, the version of the op-ed Kiselyov highlighted was posted on a different site <a href="https://www.johndenugent.com/english/paul-craig-roberts-when-will-they-assassinate-trump-as-they-did-jfk-rfk-etc/" target="_blank">nine days later</a> -- a blog belonging to John de Nugent, who has been <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/john-de-nugent" target="_blank">described by the Southern Poverty Law Center</a> as a longtime white supremacist writer who claims that humanity evolved from extraterrestrial races: 



<blockquote>The “Solutreans” are a crucial component of de Nugent’s ideological perspective. He explains his racism with a convoluted theory about space aliens, “Reptilians” and intergalactic warfare. In his telling, true Aryans are descended from “Exonordic” aliens, a perfect race that is at war with the Reptilians. Other aliens (called “Grey Aliens”) are allied with the Jews, who the Grey Aliens are helping in their quest to achieve world domination. Or, as de Nugent puts it: “What we now understand is that our race colonized this earth, but was long ago separated by a cataclysmic nuclear war from the home planets. The stories of the gods reflect actual visits to earth by actual, highly evolved relatives of ourselves. The ‘ancient aliens’ theory being promoted now non-stop on TV (by the Jews who own the TV networks) is partly valid, but the Jewish media refuses to highlight the huge role of the Exonordics, and focuses instead on the Grays and the Reptilian species, because the Jews themselves are allied with THEM. Earth is just one battlefield of an ongoing war in our entire Milky Way galaxy between the Exonordics and the Reptilians.”

De Nugent’s solution to the Judeo-Grey Alien alliance is to move true Nordic white people into “White safety zones,” such as a region comprising Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and West Virginia. De Nugent justifies this in part by arguing that these states are ancestral white lands, relying on a discredited theory that North America was initially inhabited, for over 10,000 years, by white Europeans who eventually were exterminated by American Indian tribes. De Nugent believes that his “Solutrean Solution” will restore proper ownership to lands that rightfully belong to white Europeans.</blockquote>



De Nugent did not offer any evidence to corroborate or supplement Lendman's theory. Instead he added a "warning" at the end of the post:



<blockquote>White nationalists should not be putting all their eggs in the Trump basket. He could be gone tomorrow.

Or he stays alive by selling us out.
</blockquote>
