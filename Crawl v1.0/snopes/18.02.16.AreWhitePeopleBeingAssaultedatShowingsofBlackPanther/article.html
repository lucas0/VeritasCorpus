  As the Marvel Entertainment film
  <em>
   Black Panther
  </em>
  opened in the U.S. in February 2018, some social media users attempted to put a damper on the occasion by posting fake accounts of anti-white attacks only to be foiled by other users’ photo-sleuthing skills.

  One photo posted on Twitter

  generated around 400 retweets before being debunked. The image showed a towel soaked in blood over a sink alongside the caption:

 <blockquote>
  <p>

  But other users quickly

  Twitter suspended the account behind that fake post, as well as the one that attempted to pass off a

  of a 19-year-old Swedish woman’s bloodied face. She was actually attacked at a bar in Malmo, despite false claims the photo was taken after an “assault” connected to the film, which features a nearly all-black cast:

  There is no indication that these posts are coordinated, but another social media user passing themselves off as the victim of an assault — this one using a photo taken from a British makeup artist’s
