<blockquote>
 <p>
  Engraved in the stones are ten guidelines meant to re-establish the planet and society, perhaps after an apocalypse. They are written in eight different languages, English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese and Russian, and among other commandments preach to:
 </p>
 <p>
  – Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Rule passion – faith – tradition – and all things with tempered reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Balance personal rights with social duties.
 </p>
 <p>
  – Be not a cancer on the earth – Leave room for nature.
 </p>
 <p>
  The guidestones also serve as an astronomical calendar, and every day at noon the sun shines through a narrow hole in the structure and illuminates the day’s date on an engraving. The names of four ancient languages are inscribed on the sides near the top: Babylonian cuneiform, Classical Greek, Sanskrit, and Egyptian Hieroglyphics. Additionally an instructional tablet at the site speaks of a time capsule buried underneath the surface, though the dates on which the capsule was buried and when it is to be re-opened are missing. Whether this is intentional or the capsule was never buried is unknown.
