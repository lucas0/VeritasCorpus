  As a 39-year military veteran, I think I know something about the flag, the anthem, patriotism, and I think I know why we fight. Itâ€™s not to allow the president to divide us by wrapping himself in the national banner. I never imagined myself saying this before Friday, but if now forced to choose in this dispute, put me down with Kaepernick.
