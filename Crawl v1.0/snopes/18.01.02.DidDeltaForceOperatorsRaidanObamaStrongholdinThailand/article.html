  On 27 December 2017, the web site SomeonesBones.com
  <a href="https://archive.is/TFgXV" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   published
  </a>
  an article appearing to report that Delta Force operators had raided an “Obama-controlled stronghold,” whatever that means, in Thailand on Christmas Day:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   During the pre-dawn hours on Christmas Day, Delta Force operators launched a precision strike against an Obama-controlled stronghold in Thailand, says an active Secret Service agent who claims President Trump green lit the operation following a series of telephone calls to United States military commanders and to Thailand Prime Minister Nik Bukharin.

  SomeonesBones.com is not a news outlet. The web site deals with and traffics in conspiracy theories, and according to their “
  <a href="https://archive.is/jUl1P" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   About
  </a>
  ” page is largely focused on unraveling the mysteries of
  <a href="https://www.snopes.com/nasa-warns-nibiru-is-headed-straight-for-earth/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   Nibiru
  </a>
  , a
  <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   nonexistent
  </a>
  planet that was “
  <a href="https://www.snopes.com/planet-destroy-earth/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   predicted
  </a>
  ” (falsely, because as we mentioned, it is nonexistent) to collide with Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  The article also did not bother correctly naming Thailand’s prime minister (
  <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-15639418" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   Prayut Chan-ocha
  </a>
  ). While we cannot say with certainty why this site used the name Nik Bukharain, we found it interesting to note that
  <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nikolay-Ivanovich-Bukharin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   Nikolai Bukharin
  </a>
  was a Soviet politician and author who was executed in 1938 for conspiring to overthrow the Soviet state. The name “Vladimir Vladomirovich,” which is a slight misspelling of Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s full name (Vladimir Vladimirovich), also appears in the footer of the site.
 </p>
 <p>
  The article also uses misleading photographs, such as the one below, to illustrat the claim that Obama owns “a mansion and a 400-acre estate on the outskirts of the city of Si Sa Ket”:

  Someonesbones.com also did not provide sources, claiming instead to quote an apparently nonexistent article from an apparently nonexistent publication:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In a June 2009 edition of the Washington Beacon, conservative author Thomas Clearwater wrote, “Solyndra does not appear to be a legitimate institution, and is likely a shell company or slush fund used or owned by Obama to launder his dirty money.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The web site did not provide a link back to the story, and we found no record of a publication named the “Washington Beacon.” The site may have been referring to “The Washington Free Beacon,” but we found no record of a Thomas Clearwater, nor the quoted material, on that web site (which was only launched in 2012). Someonesbones.com may have offering a wink and a nod toward
  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5691248/" rel="noopener" style="background-color: #ffffff;" target="_blank">
   Thomas Clearwater,
  </a>
  a film producer who shares similar interests as SomeonesBones.com and has produced projects such as “Truth Embargo” about the existence of aliens.
 </p>
 <p>
  The claim that Delta Force operators raided an Obama-controlled stronghold in Thailand is not based on any factual information.
