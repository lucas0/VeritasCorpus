   article
  </a>
  which appeared to report that a death row inmate named Jeremy Morris ate an entire Bible for his last meal. It was accompanied by the following photograph, showing a man with heavy face and neck tattoos, including a pentagram on his forehead:

   When the prison staff asked 33-year Jeremy Morris if he wanted anything special for his last meal, he answered “I just want a Bible”.

   The prison guards of the William C. Holman Correctional Facility thought he wanted to pray and repent, so they gave him an old copy of the King James Bible.
  </p>
  <p>
   Against all expectations, the condemned murderer began tearing up the holy book and eating it.
