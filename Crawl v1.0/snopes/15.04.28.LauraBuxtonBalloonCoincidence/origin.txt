  The discovery of a deflated balloon in a hedge has sparked off an amazing series of coincidences for ten-year-old Laura Buxton from Milton Lilbourne, near Marlborough, and her namesake who lives
  <nobr>
   140 miles
  </nobr>
  away in the Midlands.
 </p>
 <p>
  The tale of the two Lauras began when Andy Rivers, of Milton Lilbourne, was checking cows in a field and found a balloon in a hedge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Closer inspection revealed the balloon said “Happy
  <nobr>
   50th Birthday”
  </nobr>
  and had a label on it with the name Laura Buxton and an address near Stoke on Trent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mr Rivers knew his neighbours Peter and Eleanor Buxton had a  daughter called Laura so gave the balloon to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  That was the start of the discovery of a series of coincidences involving the two girls who live a three-hour drive away from each other and are not related.
 </p>
 <p>
  Laura, ten, who goes to Kingsbury Hill School, Marlborough, obeyed the instruction on the balloon tag which said: “Please write to Laura Buxton.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She was surprised to get a telephone call from the other Laura, who is nine and also an only child.
 </p>
 <p>
  The girls discovered they shared more than a name and just a few months difference in age.
 </p>
 <p>
  They are both fair haired, in Year 5 at primary school, have black three-year-old female Labrador dogs and have a rabbit and a guinea pig each.
 </p>
 <p>
  By an even greater coincidence the grandparents of Laura, from Stoke on Trent, Terry and Margaret Buxton, are currently travelling the Kennet and Avon Canal and were moored at Wootton Rivers.
 </p>
 <p>
  The girls are now hoping to meet one day and the Milton Lilbourne Buxtons have invited their Midlands namesakes to visit them in the Pewsey Vale.
