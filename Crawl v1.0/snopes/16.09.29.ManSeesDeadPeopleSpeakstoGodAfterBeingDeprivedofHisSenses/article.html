  <!-- In 1983 a man was tested to see if he could sense god if all of his senses were taken away. Every sense nerve in his brain was disconnected. He could not feel, hear, see or smell. He began reporting he could hear the voices of the dead and gave precise details that he could have not known. He then said he could see them and began clawing at his eyes. It turned to screaming and biting chunks of his flesh off. His last words were "I have spoken with God, and he has abandoned us" and died. -->
