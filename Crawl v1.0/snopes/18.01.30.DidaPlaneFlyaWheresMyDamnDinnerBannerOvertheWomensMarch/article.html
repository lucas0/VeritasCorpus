  <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/01/womens-march-protest-count/514166/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   millions
  </a>
  of women marched in protest in Washington D.C. and cities around the world. As photographs of the event made their way around the internet, an image appeared purportedly showing a plane flying a banner reading “Where’s My Damn Dinner?” over the crowd:

  This image took another lap around the internet in January 2018 after a second Women’s March took place in cities across the country. Many overtly misogynist web sites shared this image, including

  , which chided protesters for lacking proper cooking skills, and
  <a href="https://archive.is/LXcFD" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   Chateau Heartiste

  , which called the pilot the “Alpha Male of the Month.” But the image also spread to a seemingly neutral outlet, appearing in the

  <a href="https://archive.is/y3sF7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  “The best signs from the 2018 Women’s March.” The Irish newspaper appears to have pulled the image from a Twitter account labeled #parody that has posted

  This image is not a genuine photograph, it did not originate in 2018, and this “alpha” pilot is completely fictional.

  This is a composite of two different images: One showing a group of protesters holding various signs beneath an empty blue sky, and a second showing a plane towing a banner.

  It is also worth considering that the concept of the domineering “alpha male” is based on
