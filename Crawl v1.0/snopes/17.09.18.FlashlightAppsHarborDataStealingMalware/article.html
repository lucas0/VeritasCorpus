  On 1 October 2014, cybersecurity company

   SnoopWall

  released a “threat assessment report” discussing flashlight apps for Android devices and security threats they may pose. Although the report was released to the accompaniment of alarmist news stories about how some flashlight apps could potentially access banking information and cell phone video cameras and send users’ personal information to cybercriminals abroad in India, China, and Russia, the SnoopWall report itself neither stated nor offered evidence that such activity was taking place.  That report merely charted the permissions accessed by the top ten Android flashlight apps and offered some tips about “best practices for increasing privacy and security on your device without spending any money.”

 <p>
  It is indeed the case that a number of flashlight apps can and do request access to permissions and data on users’ cell phones that seemingly has nothing to do with the ordinary functioning of the app, and that such permissions could theoretically enable criminals to obtain sensitive personal information from cell phone users.  However:

     Having a flashlight app on your cell phone does not necessarily mean someone is stealing your personal data.
    </li>
   </br>
  </ul>
 </p>
 <p>
  <li>
   Most customers use the flashlight apps that are natively provided with the Android and iOS operating systems on their smartphones, and those apps pose no security threats.
  </li>
 </p>
 <p>
  <li>
   Just because an app requests permissions it may not need does not mean the app is being used for nefarious purposes.  (Many, many apps request more permissions than they seemingly need.)
  </li>
 </p>
 <p>
  <li>
   Nothing about flashlight apps makes them inherently more susceptible to criminal exploitation.  (Flashlight apps just happen to be one of the most common cell phone apps.)
  </li>
 </p>
 <p>
  <li>
   Any type of cell phone app could potentially be exploited for stealing personal data (or other nefarious reasons).
