  On 31 January 2017, against the backdrop of a controversy over new immigration entry restrictions, a Facebook

  the above-reproduced image of a small boy in handcuffs along with the following caption:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Detained at Dulles. I feel so much safer now.
  </p>

 <p>
  As controversy continued to rage over a 27 January 2017 executive order which limits entry to the United States from a list of

   seven countries
  </a>
  , social media users widely assumed that this photograph showed a child detained at Dulles International Airport because of the new policy.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, we traced the image back to an August 2015

   controversy
  </a>
  in Kentucky involving sheriff’s deputies handcuffing young students with learning disabilities:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The ACLU is suing Kenton County sheriff’s Deputy Kevin Sumner, who works as a school resource officer at Latonia Elementary School in Covington. Sumner is accused of handcuffing an 8-year-old boy and a 9-year-old girl, who both have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  It is not apparent whether the image circulated in error, or if it was purposely misidentified. However, it does not show a handcuffed child detained at Dulles in January 2017; it shows a handcuffed child detained at school in August 2015.

 <p>
  This is not to say that children have not been
