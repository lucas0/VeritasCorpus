  A friend of a friend who is a Readymix driver suspected his wife of infidelity. One day, he made sure that she thought he was going to be miles away, and then drove past his house. Sure enough, the bedroom curtains were drawn, and outside stood a brand-new Triumph convertible. Sickened at this display of opulence, our driver had a brilliant idea on the spur of the moment â€” he drove round the block and prepared his load of cement. Then he returned, positioned his lorry, extended the chute, reverse the barrel and filled the Triumph convertible with Readymix. As he packed up to drive away, a foxy little man came out of his house, climbed on to a bicycle, and pedalled briskly away in the opposite direction.

  Her favorite is the one about the woman whose husband drives a cement truck. She has saved for years to buy him a Cadillac convertible for their anniversary. The Cadillac is in the driveway and she is negotiating with the salesman when her husband comes home. Seeing the flashy car, and seeing his wife talking with a strange man, he dumps his load of cement in the convertible.
