  The incident shown in this video (a higher quality version is included below) is real, but this footage has nothing to do with Islam and little to do with Christianity.
 </p>
 <p>
  This video has been
  <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=51e_1405254580" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   online
  </a>
  since at least 2014, when it was posted to the web site
  <em>
   LiveLeak.
  </em>
  It shows Alexander Shevtsov, the leader of what is apparently a Russian cult. There are several videos of Shevtsov leading his “classes” in which he hits his students on a regular basis:

   While the exact context of this footage is still unclear, it appears that the incident took place during one of Shevtsov’s lectures at his “Academy of Self-Knowledge.” The program, according to
   <em>

   is a mixture of magic, martial arts, psychology, and includes a “cleansing of the soul” (similar to an exorcism) which may be what is depicted above:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In many cases it borders on the folk magic rites. A special role is assigned to boasting as a means to set an ideal goal and stimulate spiritual concentration need for achieving it.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kresenie is essentially “burning out” (
   <em>
    dulit,
   </em>
   <em>
    дулить
   </em>
   ) of evil influences which infected the soul from outside, or, simply speaking, possession (
   <em>
    oderzhanie,
   </em>
   <em>
    одержание
   </em>
   ). These influences, or
   <em>
    porcha
   </em>
   , as well as various auto-generated obstacles (
   <em>
    gamukha,
   </em>
   <em>
    гамуха
   </em>
   ) must be “burnt” just like the litter in Russian peasant’s house had to be burnt in the oven. There exist malicious fixations that can, so to say, mentally imprison a person (so called
   <em>
    zapadki
   </em>
   , западки which were imagined as a bulb in the steam –
   <em>
    para,
   </em>
   пара), or some malicious being which dwells in our memory (
   <em>
    larva
   </em>
   ), or deeply rooted resentments having big extensions in the external world, spaces of hard feelings (
   <em>
    kosmy
   </em>
   , космы) etc.

  Shevtsov, who came to be

   called

  While the full context of the video is not available, it is clear given the video’s history and context that claims that it shows a “Muslim man” slapping a “Christian woman” was made up from whole cloth.
