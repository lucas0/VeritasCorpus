   published

  an article in December 2016 claiming that First Lady Michelle Obama’s Secret Service detail had abruptly quit and left her alone on the street in Hawaii:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Michelle Obama’s nasty attitude has finally cost her bigly. The fierce First Lady, well-known for treating her Secret Service detail like animals, was screaming at them while walking down a street in Maui when they decided they had been her victim for the last time and walked away, leaving her alone and visibly frightened.
  </p>
  <p>
   Michelle was forced to walk back to the hotel the First Family was spending your money to stay at all by herself while crowds of people gathered to throw lettuce at her and shout “Trump Trump Trump!!!” By the time she made it back she was in tears.

  While

  article received some attention when it was first published, the story recirculated more widely on social media in January 2017 after it was picked up and republished by web sites such as
  <em>
   USPostMan.com.

 <p>
  However, there was no truth to the above-quoted story.
