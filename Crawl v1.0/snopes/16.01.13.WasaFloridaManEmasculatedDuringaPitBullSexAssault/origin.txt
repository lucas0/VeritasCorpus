  “The dog was just running around, playing with a ball, when the man came out of nowhere and tried to grab it,” says Dorothy Steinberg, a witness of the events. “The man had his pants down and was struggling with the dog. Everyone in the park was just stunned and nobody did anything, but the dog defended itself and bit back. In a matter of seconds, he grabbed the man’s genitals with its teeth and literally tore them apart.”
