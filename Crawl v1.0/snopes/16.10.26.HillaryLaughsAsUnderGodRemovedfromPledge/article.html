  On 26 October 2016, the conservative web site
  <em>
   Free Republic
  </em>
  recirculated a video purportedly showing Hillary Clinton laughing as Freeholder Susan Shin Angulo flubbed voicing the words “under God” during a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance at a campaign event:

   A woman introducing Hillary Clinton at a campaign event conspicuously removed the words “under God” from the end of the Pledge of Allegiance, prompting the Democratic primary front-runner to laugh.
  </p>
  <p>
   Susan Shin Angulo, a member of the Camden County Board of Freeholders, began to say the phrase at a campaign rally in Blackwood, New Jersey, on Wednesday, but caught herself in the act and skipped over it.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Only Hillary can bring us together as one nation, un- — indivisible, with liberty and justice for all,” Ms. Angulo said.
  </p>
  <p>
   The crowd broke out into applause and cheers. Mrs. Clinton nodded and laughed.

  The above-displayed video is real. The footage was taken at a campaign event in Camden County, New Jersey, on 11 May 2016 and features Freeholder Susan Shin Angulo introducing Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Angulo failed to enunciate the words “under God” during her recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, she averred that she had merely made a

   mistake
  </a>
  at an inopportune moment and not intended to elide the phrase:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “It was just overwhelming and I have to say I am so embarrassed for stumbling at the worst possible time of my speech,” Angulo told New Jersey 101.5. “Anyone who has seen me speak knows I proudly say ‘God Bless America’ in all my speeches. My apologies if anyone thought it was intentional.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The video does show Hillary Clinton smiling and laughing as Angulo flubbed the Pledge of Allegiance, but it’s not clear if she was laughing specifically at the omission of “under God” or was simply trying to make an awkward moment less awkward.
