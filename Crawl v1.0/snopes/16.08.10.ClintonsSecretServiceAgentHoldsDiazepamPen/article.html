  Conservative corners of the Internet were aflutter in August 2016 over claims that a Secret Service agent frequently spotted standing near Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention was actually a doctor carrying a
  <a href="https://www.drugs.com/diazepam.html" target="_blank">
   Diazepam pen
  </a>
  in case the presidential nominee had a seizure. While these claims have proliferated quickly across social media, the evidence back them up is flimsy to non-existent.

  Author Mike Cernovich was one of the first to raise questions about Clinton’s bodyguard when he posted images purportedly showing the agent’s “medic badge” on Twitter:

   Hillary’s handler is medic (see badge) and carries pen with injection.

  Fringe web sites such as the
  <em>
   Ralph Retort
  </em>
  the
  <em>
   Conservative Treehouse
  </em>
  and the
  <em>
   Last Refuge
  </em>
  have attempted to legitimize the “doctor angle” by asserting that Clinton’s attendant might have been identified as Dr. Oladotun Okunola, such as when
  <em>
   The Ralph Retort
  </em>
  offered a confusing headline — “REPORT: CLINTON’S HANDLER IDENTIFIED as Neurologist Dr. Oladotun Okunola?” — that purposefully misled readers by emphasizing the salacious (but untrue) words “CLINTON’S HANDLER IDENTIFIED” then returning to lower case before inserting a skeptical question mark.
