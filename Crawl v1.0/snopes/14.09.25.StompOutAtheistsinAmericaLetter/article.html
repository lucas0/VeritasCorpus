  Attempting to assign any kind of “true” or “false” status to letters to the editor is often tricky, because such letters are generally expressions of opinion (rather than fact), the senders of such letters are not  necessarily the original authors of the material presented (i.e., readers often
  <nobr>
   re-submit
  </nobr>
  under their own names letters they’ve read in other newspapers, or material they’ve gleaned from other print sources), and such letters are sometimes couched in irony or sarcasm (a facet which can escape many readers) and are intended to express the opposite of what they literally state.

 <p>
  In this case, at least, we can make a few statements about a much circulated letter advocating that Americans “Stomp out atheists”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   It’s time to stomp out atheists in America. The majority of Americans would love to see atheists kicked out of America. If you don’t believe in God, then get out of this country.
  </p>
  <p>
   The United States is based on having freedom of religion, speech, etc., which means you can believe in God any way you want (Baptist, Catholic, Methodist, etc.), but you must believe.
  </p>
  <p>
   I don’t recall freedom of religion meaning no religion. Our currency even says, “In God We Trust.” So, to all the atheists in America: Get out of our country.
  </p>
  <p>
   Atheists have caused the ruin of this great nation by taking prayer out of our schools and being able to practice what can only be called evil. I don’t care if they have never committed a crime, atheists are the reason crime is rampant.
