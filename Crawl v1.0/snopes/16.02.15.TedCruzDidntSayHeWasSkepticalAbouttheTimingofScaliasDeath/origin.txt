  Appearing on ABC’s This Week, 2016 GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz said he would “absolutely” filibuster anyone that President Barack Obama attempts to appoint to fill Justice Antonin Scalia’s seat on the Supreme Court…

  “…Well, George, first of all, the timing of his death is just ludicrous to me. I mean, God would have never allowed the great Antonin Scalia to be called to meet him at such a perilous time for our country. God has always stood by America, and has always loved Republicans. So, it kind of makes no sense that he’d go and do something like this to us now.”

  “Now, I know that there are already countless theories going around about how Justice Scalia was assassinated by the CIA or the Illuminati, or whoever. Even though to a layman that might sound as something plausible, the trained eye cannot be fooled. I know that the Democrats had something to do with it.”
