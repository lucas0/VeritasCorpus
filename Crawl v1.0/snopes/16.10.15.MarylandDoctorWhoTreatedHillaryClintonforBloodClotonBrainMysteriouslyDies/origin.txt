  “We are ready to officially call it a suicide and we’re confident that the medical examiner’s office will determine the manner of death was a suicide,” Alcorn said. “There was video inside the business that we reviewed that [shows] the doctor was alone at the time of his death and leading up to it, and he also left several notes.”

  Detectives believe Sherlekar died of an intentional overdose, based on evidence gathered and the lack of any sign of significant trauma to his body, Alcorn said.

  “We don’t know what’s involved in terms of the chemicals used, but it appears to be an overdose,” Alcorn said. “When the [medical examiner] gives us the toxicology reports back, we should know more.”
