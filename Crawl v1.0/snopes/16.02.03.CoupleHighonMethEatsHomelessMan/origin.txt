  “We found a couple that met the description of the 911 reports we had been receiving,” said Patrolman Sanchez. “My partner and I identified themselves and asked the couple to turn around. When they did, their faces were covered with blood and we heard the homeless man was crying for help. From what we could initially see, the two perpetrators had already eaten off every single one of the homeless man’s fingers and began chewing off his toes when we arrived on the scene.”
