  “We know that our greatness comes when we appreciate each other’s strengths, when we learn from each other, when we lean on each other. Because in this country, it’s never been each person for themselves. No, we’re all in this together. We always have been.” —The First Lady to the graduates of @CCNYCityCollege. #ReachHigher
