  How many wives can a Muslim have on welfare in the state of Michigan? This is based on a conservative video currently “making the rounds” on the internet.
  <br>

 <p>
  I actually called the Michigan Dept. of Human Services to check this out and it is true.
 </p>
 <p>
  Have we gone completely nuts!
 </p>
 <p>
  THE CAMEL’S NOSE IS OFFICIALLY IN THE TENT IN MICHIGAN!
 </p>
 <p>
  Muslim men are allowed to have as many as 4 wives. Many Muslims have immigrated into the U.S. And brought their 2-3-or 4 wives with them, but the U.S. does not allow multi marriages, so the man lists one wife as his,
  <br/>
  and signs the other 2 or 3 up as extended family on welfare and other free Government programs!
 </p>
 <p>
  Michigan has the highest population of Muslims in the United States. When President Obama took office the United States paid several millions of dollars to have a large number of Palestinians, (All Muslim), immigrated here from Palestine! Why? We don’t pay for other persons to immigrate here, and I’m sure that some of those Muslims moved into Michigan with the large current number of Muslims already established there.

  So now in Michigan when you call the Public Assistance office you are told to Press 1 for English. Press 2 for Spanish, or Press 3 for Arabic! CHECK IT OUT YOURSELF – Here is the number 1-888-678-8914.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every time you add a new language to an American program it requires an additional number of persons fluent in that language to process those persons who refuse to learn English in order to live here at an additional cost to the taxpayer! Why are we even allowing persons to immigrate here who cannot provide for themselves and then putting them in our welfare system?
 </p>
 <p>
  Press 3 for Arabic!
 </p>
 <p>
  This is quite alarming!!! This seems to have happened clandestinely, or as far as I know, because no public announcement or opportunity to vote on this was offered to the American people. They’re just adopting an official stance, and very likely using tax-payer money for it, in various capacities, without public knowledge or approval.

 <p>
  The following link takes you into the State of Michigan Public Assistance page, (as in Food Stamps etc). You won’t have to scroll far before you see the assistance-letters options for…(get this)…English, Spanish, and ARABIC! When did the ARABIC option sneak into our culture? We don’t do this for other cultures, except those that speak Spanish! Will we soon have to listen to our governmental offices, stores, and other venues offer us the option of “pressing 3 for ARABIC?”

  Check it out for yourself. http://www.Michigan.Gov/dhs/0,1607,7-124-5453_5527—,00.HTML (When you get to this web site, just click on the FORMS AND PUBLICATIONS button – those forms in Arabic are listed as ending in AR!)
 </p>
 <p>
  Please inform every red-blooded American you know, that this is happening. It is outrageous!

  YOUR AMERICAN TAX DOLLARS AT WORK!
