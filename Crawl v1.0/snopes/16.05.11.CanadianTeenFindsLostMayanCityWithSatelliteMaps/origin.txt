  A Canadian schoolboy appears to have discovered a lost Mayan city hidden deep in the jungles of Mexico using a new method of matching stars to the location of temples on earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  William Gadoury, 15, was fascinated by the ancient Central American civilization and spent hours poring over diagrams of constellations and maps of known Mayan cities.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then he made a startling realisation: the two appeared to be linked … William took to Google Maps and projected that there must be another city hidden deep in the thick jungles of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico[.]
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was really surprised and excited when I realised that the most brilliant stars of the constellations matched the largest Maya cities,” he told the Journal de Montréal.
 </p>
 <p>
  In hundreds of years of scholarship, no other scientist had ever found such a correlation.
