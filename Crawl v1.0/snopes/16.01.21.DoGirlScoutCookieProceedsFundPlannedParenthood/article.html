  For several years, social media users have shared memes claiming that funds from the sale of Girl Scout Cookies are distributed to Planned Parenthood. Every year, hashtags such as “#cookiecott” are used in the promotion of the rumor.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the claim that Girl Scout Cookies fund Planned Parenthood became popular in mid-2015 and early 2016 (likely in part due to a series of questionable viral

  However, the rumor predated that article. On Twitter, tweets from early 2010 indicated that the rumor was in circulation at that time, too:

  We contacted the Girl Scouts of the USA to determine whether any portion of the rumor was true.  They responded that no proceeds have ever been donated from the sale of Girl Scout Cookies to Planned Parenthood, and furnished us with the following statement:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Girl Scouts does not take a position on abortion or birth control. We believe these are matters that are best discussed within the family.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  A specific
  <a href="http://www.girlscouts.org/en/cookies/all-about-cookies/FAQs.html" target="_blank">
   answer
  </a>
  regarding Girl Scout Cookie sale proceeds was available on the organization’s web site:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   <em>
    Does any part of Girl Scout Cookie Program revenue support organizations other than the local Girl Scout council?
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    One hundred percent of the net revenue raised through the Girl Scout Cookie Program stays with the local council and troops.
   </strong>
   Girl Scout troops set goals on how to spend their proceeds on program-related activities, such as paying their own way to a community event or museum, or funding other programmatic outings. Girl Scout troops may also choose to use proceeds to purchase materials for a Take Action/Service project to benefit the community.
