  People taking surf lessons on Butler Beach were in a for big surprise when they entered the water Saturday.
 </p>
 <p>
  At around 12:30 p.m., Dakota Dodson, a surf instructor for the St. Augustine Surf School, noticed a fin sticking out of the water and went to investigate.
 </p>
 <p>
  “At first, I only saw the fin, so I just assumed it a live shark. But then I realized it was only half of one,” he said.
 </p>
 <p>
  The half-eaten carcass, measuring about 2.5 feet, was found floating in knee-deep water, Dodson said.
 </p>
 <p>
  The circumstances of how the shark died remain unclear, but experts believe it was likely eaten by another shark.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s most likely it was bitten in half by another shark — sharks have to eat, too,” said Tara Dodson, environmental supervisor for St. Johns County.
