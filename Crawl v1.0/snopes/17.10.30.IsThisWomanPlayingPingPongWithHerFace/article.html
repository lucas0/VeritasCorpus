  As it turns out, taking balls to the face is no testament to the quality of your skin.

  An animated gif purportedly showing a woman using her face as a paddle during a game of ping pong went viral on social media after it was

  The Tofu Moritadaya company has been coy about the authenticity of this commercial—but skin care brands everywhere tend to over-promise and under-deliver. When the ad was posted to

   Facebook

  in 2015, it was accompanied by the caption (roughly translated via Google) “What do you associate with listening to beautiful skin? The ultimate Hari creates an impact movie. # Facial table tennis girl.” It was accompanied by a similarly playful caption (I don’t want to face such an opponent) when it was shared on

  , and when the “person in charge” of Tofu Moritaya spoke to the Japanese publication “

 <blockquote>

   “I will leave it to your imagination. It’s content that you can enjoy both those who know table tennis and those who do not have it. I hope you will be introduced to your family and friends. I am also interested in hopefully it would be greatly appreciated if you could have the item in hand.”

  Although Tofu Moritadaya won’t say whether or not the footage of a woman using her head as a ping pong paddle is authentic, we can safely say that this video was digitally manipulated for a number of reasons. For instance, the only footage that we could find of this woman using her remarkable talent (and ultimate firm skin) as a ping pong paddle is from this commercial. And even though this video appears authentic when played at full speed (largely in part to a shaky, blurry camera), the ball movement looks less natural when the video is slowed down:

  This Tofu Moritadaya skin care advertisement was probably inspired by a similar
  <a href="https://www.snopes.com/photos/advertisements/pingpong.asp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   commercial
  </a>
  produced in 2008 which purportedly showed Bruce Lee playing ping pong with nunchaku. That video was also digitally manipulated and was created to promote a Nokia N96 Limited Edition Bruce Lee cell phone.
