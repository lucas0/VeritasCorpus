  Creating homebrew visual aids touting the accomplishments (or failures) of top politicians is a popular online pastime, not least because it’s a cheap and easy way to propagandize, and because there are no pesky standards of fairness and accuracy to meet. As we’ve noted with regard to previous specimens (for example, a late-2016 meme touting the alleged economic
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/barack-obama-accomplishments/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   achievements
  </a>
  of President Obama), the graphic format lends itself to the display of cherry-picked facts to make a simplistic case with no semblance of context or nuance.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this case, the claim is that, despite all the carping in the mainstream press about “chaos” and “ineptitude” in the Oval Office, President Trump has actually accomplished quite a lot during his first four months as chief executive, and thus you will not find mention of major campaign promises Trump has had difficulty keeping so far, such as instituting a Muslim immigration ban and building a wall on the Mexican border.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, since it’s very much a partisan case being made, there will be disagreement over what constitutes an “accomplishment.” Some feats, such as reducing unemployment, are uncontroversial, while others, such as dismantling entire government agencies, aren’t likely to be regarded as accomplishments by those who find the functions of those agencies critical.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here are the claims:

  </p>
  <p>
   Employers added 211,000 jobs in April as the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.4 percent, the lowest level since May 2007.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  It bears pointing out that the jobless rate had already been on a steady decline since 2010. Further,

 </p>
 <p>
  To what degree short-term improvements in the economy since January can be attributed to a new chief executive whose economic policies remain nascent is perennially up for debate, though

  It’s not necessarily accurate to characterize all of these commitments as “accomplishments” of President Trump, however. As CBS Moneywatch’s Irina Ivanova
  <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-isnt-why-corporate-america-is-investing-in-the-u-s/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   reported
  </a>
  in January 2017:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Few of the jobs companies are promising to create in the U.S. can be attributed to a sudden renewed commitment to USA Inc. inspired by Trump’s “America First” policies. Indeed, the businesses Trump has been quick to praise have been careful not to characterize their recent hiring announcements as new. And as usual with corporate investments of this scale, such plans are typically months — or even years — in the making, suggesting they long predate the presidential election.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  For example, Fiat Chrysler said their

   promise
  </a>
  of a $1 billion investment in Michigan and Ohio plants, projected to create 2,000 jobs, was the “second phase” of an industrialization plan announced in 2016. GM’s $1 billion investment was “several years in the making,” according to sources cited by CBS.
 </p>
 <p>
  The largest of all the announced commitments, SoftBank’s pledge of $50 billion, was also in the works long before Trump won the election:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Another widely publicized corporate initiative that Trump trumpeted — a promise by SoftBank to create 50,000 high-tech jobs in the U.S. — was the result of a tech fund the company announced on Oct. 14 — three weeks before the election. Given the massive tech industry in the U.S., economists say much of the planned $50 billion investment would have found its way to the states regardless of who occupied the White House.

   “You don’t just decide overnight to invest $3 billion,” said Nathan Jensen, a professor at the University of Texas who studies interactions between government and corporations.

  </a>
  to an $8 billion investment and the creation of 3,000 U.S. jobs was announced by the Trump transition team after the president-elect met in January 2017 with the CEOs of Bayer AG and Monsanto, who are planning a merger. Transition spokesman Sean Spicer credited Trump’s negotiating skills for the pledge, but some

   analysts
  </a>
  were skeptical that the companies had actually promised anything that wasn’t already on the table when plans for the merger were first revealed in September 2016:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Bayer and Monsanto said in a joint statement after Spicer’s remarks that the “combined company expects to spend approximately $16 billion in R&amp;D in agriculture over the next six years with at least half of this investment made in the United States.”
  </p>
  <p>
   That amounts to about $2.7 billion a year, which roughly equates to what the combined companies already spend in that area globally, [Wall Street analyst Jeremy] Redenius said. As for the U.S. breakdown, he estimates it’s likely close to half already; Monsanto spends $1.5 billion a year, the majority of which is in the U.S., he said, and Bayer already invests in R&amp;D here as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Not an increase, but not substantially cutting,” he said of the global figure.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The merger, which awaits U.S. regulatory approval, is not likely to be completed until 2018, CNBC

  Budget Surplus
 </h2>
 <p>
  <strong>
   $182B in April 2017
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  It is true that the U.S. Treasury reported a $182 billion budget surplus in April 2017, the largest April surplus since 2001 (and the second-largest in history), according to
  <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-april-budget-surplus-rises-to-182-billion-2017-05-10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   MarketWatch
  </a>
  . It’s unclear exactly how that surplus is attributable to President Trump, however. April is typically a surplus month because of tax receipts. In addition, citing a Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
  <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52692#section2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   review
  </a>
  as its source, Associated Press reported that the April 2017 surplus was “
  <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2017-05-10/federal-government-records-1824-billion-budget-surplus" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   inflated
  </a>
  ” because of a tax deadline change allowing corporations to pay federal taxes in April that in previous years were paid in March.
 </p>
 <p>
  It remains to be seen what effect Tump’s policies will have on the budget deficit for 2017 as a whole (the fiscal year ends on 30 September). The CBO projects a 4.6 percent drop in the deficit from what it was in 2016, but that is based on laws and policies already in effect when Trump took office.

  It’s true that the Consumer Confidence Index, a metric assessing how ordinary consumers feel about the strength of the economy, hit 125.6 in March 2017, its highest point since 2000. It is also true that it
  <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/25/april-us-consumer-confidence-data.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   fell
  </a>
  five points to 120.3 the following month. Even so, it showed that consumers (as of April) had more confidence in the economy under Trump than under Obama, during whose administration the index never exceeded 113.7 (although it did manage to rise to that point after bottoming out in 2009 at 25).

 <h2>
  Legislation
 </h2>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Passed 32 bills through Congress
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  As of 17 May 2017, President Trump had
  <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/signed-legislation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   signed
  </a>
  34 bills passed by Congress, a comparatively high
  <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/27/sean-spicer/trump-has-signed-more-bills-100-days-any-president/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   number
  </a>
  in such a short period of time (since Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who signed 76 pieces of legislation in his first 100 days, only Harry Truman, at 55, signed more).
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s not to say that all of the legislation signed by Trump between January and May 2017 was necessarily noteworthy, however. One bill
  <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/legislation/hr-1362-act-name-department-veterans-affairs-community-based-outpatient-clinic-pago-pago" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   changed
  </a>
  the name of a Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic in Pago Pago, American Samoa; another
  <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/hr609" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   renamed
  </a>
  a VA health center in Pennsylvania; another approves the location of a memorial honoring Desert Storm and Desert Shield veterans; three appointed citizen regents to the board of the Smithsonian Institution.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nor should it be assumed that Trump’s signing of a given bill meant he or his administration was actively involved in its passage. Thirteen such bills nullifying federal regulations enacted during the Obama administration (such as H.J. Res. 69, reversing a U.S. Fish and Wildlife rule pertaining to Alaska’s National Wildlife Refuges and S.J. Res. 34, reversing FCC Internet privacy rules) were rushed through Congress and quickly signed because they made use of the Congressional Review Act of 1996, which imposes a 60-day limit on the time allowed to overrule previously passed laws.

   Japan:
  </strong>
  Japanese Prime Minister Abe, who has met twice with Trump, issued a joint statement with him reaffirming the “unshakable alliance” between the U.S. and Japan. That is despite Trump having called Japan a “currency manipulator” during the presidential campaign and pulling out of the TPP, which Abe supported. Whether the “very, very good chemistry” Trump says he has with Abe will improve the relationship between the two countries over the long haul remains to be seen.

  <strong>
   Russia:
  </strong>
  U.S.-Russia relations have been strained for many years, a situation not improved by Russia’s attempts to meddle in the U.S. presidential election, nor by the fact that Trump associates are under investigation for possible collusion in that effort. A U.S. missile strike by Trump against Syria, with whose government Russia is closely allied, were strongly condemned by Russian leaders, who warned there could be “extremely serious” consequences.

   U.K.:
  </strong>
  British Prime Minister Theresa May was the first foreign leader to visit the Trump White House, and their cordial meeting was portrayed by both countries as a renewal of the “special relationship” between the U.S and the U.K. According to the

  , Obama was seen by many Britons as more interested in the European Union as a whole than in the U.K. itself, while Trump, who was in favor of Brexit, is perceived as the opposite.

   Tough on Syria?
  </strong>
  In April 2017, Trump ordered U.S. missile strikes against an air base in Syria in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack on civilians by the Syrian government, which has been known to brutalize its own people during the ongoing civil war there. Trump’s gesture came up short, however, in that the Syrian Air Force was able to launch a new

   Trimming the fat at many overblown government agencies and promoting small business growth by reigning in the EPA
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it is true that President Trump
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2017/03/13/trump-review-federal-agencies/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   signed
  </a>
  an executive order on 13 March 2017 directing the heads of executive branch departments to eliminate all “unnecessary” agencies and reorganize those that remain to improve their “efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability,” the order gave said department heads six months from the date of signing to come up with suggestions for this process, so not much fat has been trimmed thus far despite the groundwork being laid.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regarding efforts to “reign in” the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a CNN report confirms that’s been among Trump’s top
  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/29/politics/trump-epa-cuts-infighting-climate-change/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   priorities
  </a>
  from the start:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   President Donald Trump made a campaign trail promise to eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency — a department once looked to as an important national force tackling climate change — and during his first 100 days in office has held true to his word, taking swift strides towards dismantling the agency and rolling back regulations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alongside EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general who once worked tangentially with the fossil fuel industry to oppose Obama-era regulations, the Trump administration has so far issued a flurry of EPA-focused executive orders, proposed employee buyouts, handed down a social media gag order and is proposing significant cuts to the EPA budget.

  Trump’s commitment to cutting “burdensome regulations,” while environmental protection groups see it as a

   directing

  a review of lands designated as national monuments:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Specifically, the review will consider all national monument designations of federal public lands since 1996 that are 100,000 acres or larger. Mr Trump singled out former President Barack Obama’s “egregious” use of federal power in using the
   <a href="https://www.nps.gov/archeology/sites/antiquities/monumentslist.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
    Antiquities Act
   </a>
   to “unilaterally” place swaths of American land and water under federal control, adding, “it’s time we ended this abusive practice.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  As with many of the other items discussed above, whether or not one regards this as an “accomplishment” (as opposed, say, to a travesty) will depend almost entirely on one’s political views going in.
