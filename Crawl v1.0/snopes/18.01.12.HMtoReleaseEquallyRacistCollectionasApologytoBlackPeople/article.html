  In early January 2018, clothing company H&amp;M came under fire for an advertisement showing a black child in a sweatshirt that read: “Coolest Monkey in the Jungle.” Shortly after the company issued an
  <a href="https://www.snopes.com/2018/01/08/hm-coolest-monkey-jungle/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   apology
  </a>
  and discontinued the shirts, the entertainment web site
  <a href="https://www.huzlers.com/hm-to-release-equally-racist-collection-as-apology-to-blacks-see-collection/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   Huzlers
  </a>
  published a piece claiming that the company was attempting to make amends with an “Equally Racist” collection.
 </p>
 <p>
  The “Equally Racist” collection, as imagined by Huzlers, aims to offend people of all different racial identities, including white people:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   After H&amp;M faced huge controversy for putting an African American boy to model a hoodie which read “Coolest monkey in the jungle”, It is being reported that H&amp;M is planning on releasing a new collection that according to chairman Stefan Persson, is “equally racist to all the other races”. The collection will be called the “You’re Not Alone” collection.
  </p>
  <p>
   Stefan told reporters that the monkey hoodie was mostly being criticized by black people, so they decided to work on a collection that is racist to not only blacks, but also Hispanics, Whites, west Asians, and east Asians. Check out the collection so far below:

  Huzlers is a well-known
  <a href="https://www.snopes.com/2016/01/14/fake-news-sites/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   satire
  </a>
  web site with a long
  <a href="https://www.snopes.com/tag/huzlers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   history
  </a>
  of pushing misinformation. They carry a disclaimer in the footer stating that “Huzlers.com is the most infamous fauxtire &amp; satire entertainment website in the world.”
 </p>
 <p>
  However, people also began posting the images independent of the article itself (and thus the disclaimer). These
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FettyWapWorld/posts/1427122207397381" target="_blank">
   images
  </a>
  include a child of apparently Middle Eastern descent wearing a shirt that says “I’m the bomb,” and an East Asian child wearing a shirt that implies he eats dog meat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the images are doctored. Huzlers simply took images of children wearing real H&amp;M clothing and then digitally added racist logos. Here’s a
