 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Caught alive after a three-week hunt, a 21-foot-long (6.4-meter-long) saltwater crocodile—the biggest crocodile ever caught in the waters of Connecticut —was restrained on Thursday June 22, according to the Associated Press.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 2,369-pound (1,075-kilogram) crocodile is suspected of attacking several people and killing two. The animal, named Salty survived capture and is being held in a temporary enclosure in the Herman Issacs, Co.
