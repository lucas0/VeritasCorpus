  In March 2014, the Cream Bmp Daily web site published an
  <a href="http://creambmp.com/articles/george-zimmerman-found-dead-accidentally-shooting-loading-gun/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  positing that George Zimmerman, the man charged (and ultimately acquitted) in the fatal shooting of teenager Trayvon Martin in February 2012, had accidentally shot and killed himself while loading a gun:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   911 first responders found George Zimmerman’s lifeless body at a Florida gun range after responding to an emergency call that he shot himself while loading his weapon.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I’m not saying we took our time getting there, but we’ve shown up faster to black neighborhoods.” According to a first responder, they stopped at every light, didn’t use a siren and drove behind an elderly woman all before finally arriving on the scene. “If he was a rapper he’d be more famous now that he’s dead, but nope! Everybody just glad he’s dead.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  Soon afterwards links and excerpts referencing this item were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered it mistaking it for a genuine news article. However, this item was just a spoof — as noted in
