  claiming her child was recently the target of at attempted “sex-trafficking scam” in an unnamed store in Longview, Texas. (One commenter claimed it was a Walmart, but the original poster didn’t confirm that.)

  Rumors about sex traffickers trawling retail establishments flourished in mid-2015, but went dormant after a relatively active period of novel claims. In May 2015, a Facebook user fronted a similar claim of trafficking rings descending upon an Oklahoma

  Taken at face value, nothing in Amanda from Longview’s account matched with known operating habits of sex or human trafficking rings, and none of what she recalled was specifically enough to raise red flags.  The incident didn’t sound unlike many interactions experienced by parents of young children in public.

  about the claim shortly thereafter, which read:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Suspicious activity was reported to the Longview Police Department over the weekend. The reporting party felt that she had just avoided a potential sex trafficking situation with her two year-old child. An LPD Detective spoke with the mother at great length and she explained the situation that occurred over the weekend. She stated that while in line at the grocery store an unknown couple showed interest in her two year-old daughter. Several things occurred in a matter of a couple of seconds that caused the mother to be alarmed. Her protective instincts kicked in and she removed her child from the situation that was bringing unwanted attention to her child. As of right now this is an isolated event, we have not had any similar reports. We do appreciate this parent coming forward and letting us know about the incident at the local store. We have documented the information and also reviewed the video from the store in order to be able to share that information with other agencies should the need arise.
