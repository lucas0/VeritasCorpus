  The “Interesting Facts” page is full of humorous but incorrect claims, such as Kim Jong-Un being roommates with the dark lord Cthulhu in college, but the web site’s intent can be summed up with one of its own memes:

  Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 crashed in the Andes Mountains in 13 October 1972. While sixteen passengers did ultimately survive the ordeal (and some did, famously, have to resort to

   cannibalism
  </a>
  to do so) none of the survivors carried the name “Lincoln,” nor the actor’s family name (Clutterbuck).

  While several profiles of the actor mention Lincoln’s father, a businessman, none

   mention

  any connection to the 1972 Andes flight disaster:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Born Andrew Clutterbuck (thank heavens for Equity and stage names) in Hull, he grew up in Bath, the younger son of a businessman and a psychiatric nurse.
  </p>
  <p>
   A summer with the National Youth Theatre scuppered a vague idea of becoming a vet and, as the acting bug took hold, he dropped one of his A-levels and concentrated on auditions. His father told him he would only be allowed to go to drama school if he received offers from five or more. “That was my father,” shrugs Lincoln. “It was a very good thing, though because it really whittled out a burning desire in me.” Having obediently gained places at the top five schools, he enrolled at Rada, paying his way with jobs as a commis chef, a barman and in one of his father’s factories making car exhausts.
