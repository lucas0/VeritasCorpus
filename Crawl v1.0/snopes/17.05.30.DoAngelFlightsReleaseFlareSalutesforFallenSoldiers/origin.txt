  Angel Flights are the U.S. Air Force planes (C-130’s) used to fly home our Fallen Soldiers.

  This is the Angel Flight’s flare salute.

  Today we remember all those who’ve been carried on Angel Flights and those who’ve been lost on the battlefield – everyone who has ever died protecting our great nation…
