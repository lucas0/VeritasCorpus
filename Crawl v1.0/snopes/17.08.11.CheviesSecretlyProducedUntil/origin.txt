  The 1957 Chevrolet was introduced  by General Motors in late 1956, as part of their special Labor Day Sneak Preview of New Cars.  The
  <nobr>
   ’57 Chevy
  </nobr>
  sported nonfunctional tail fins and excess side trim like most American cars of that era, and it would have passed into obscurity except for the amazing popularity of the design in the years that followed.  While the Chevy’s competitors disappeared into the junkyards of the nation, the ’57 throve, particularly the
  <nobr>
   2-door
  </nobr>
  <nobr>
   Bel-Air
  </nobr>
  model.  The car became a favorite of customizers in Southern California, and its popularity spread across the nation.  The
  <nobr>
   ’57 Chevy
  </nobr>
  has been almost as visible on the highways of America as the Volkswagen, particularly in California and the Midwest.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 1965, the California Department of Motor Vehicles listed 35,000
  <nobr>
   ’57 Chevies
  </nobr>
  on the
  <nobr>
   road — an
  </nobr>
  astounding survival rate for an American car (although in 1957, Chevrolet enjoyed total sales of 775,000 units).  No other American automobile has survived the years with equal fortitude.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, no other American automobile, with the exception of the limited-production Studebaker Avanti, has enjoyed the unique production facilities of the
  <nobr>
   ’57 Chevy.
  </nobr>
  There have been subsequent designs for subsequent Chevrolet model years, but the ’57, unlike any other American car and contrary to American industrial practice, enjoyed a manufacturer’s run of
  <nobr>
   10 years.
  </nobr>
 </p>
 <p>
  A dedicated group of ex-Chevrolet stylists and franchised used-car salesmen continued to turn out close to 200,000 1957 Chevrolets, focusing on the
  <nobr>
   2-door
  </nobr>
  <nobr>
   Bel-Air
  </nobr>
  model, between the years 1957 and 1967, in a small auto assembly plant located outside Jacksonville, Ill.
 </p>
 <p>
  The enthusiasts, led by ex-General Motors stylist Ardell Malowick, quit GM in
  <nobr>
   mid-1957
  </nobr>
  when it was learned, to nobody’s surprise, that the 1957 design was to be scrapped in favor of the longer, lower, wider ’58 Chevy, which replaced the ’57’s peaked fins with contoured, sublimated fins.
 </p>
 <p>
  Malowick and his associates quickly decamped and purchased their own auto assembly facilities in southern Illinois. However, Malowick was unable to finance the die molds and giant steel presses which GM and Fisher Auto Body used to construct the basic body; rather, Malowick relied on the proved European coach-building technique of pounding body shape out by hand over wooden molds, formed from fiber-glass replicas of the real thing. In this way, some of the imperfections of Fisher’s mass production were eliminated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Malowick and associates knew that Chevrolet, which held all legal rights to the design, would not consent to the manufacture of
  <nobr>
   ’57 Chevies
  </nobr>
  to compete with their ’58s and subsequent models.   Perhaps GM was aware, as Malowick now contends, that subsequent models could never compete with the ’57 for purity of design.  Because of legal restrictions, the post-1957 new
  <nobr>
   ’57 Chevies
  </nobr>
  built by Malowick were sold  as remarkably well-preserved used cars in car lots across the U.S.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the sale of these cars, Malowick enjoyed the clandestine cooperation of countless used-car merchants throughout the nation who were in sympathy with his cause.  Certainly, used car dealers sought Malowick’s creations with a fervor they have not displayed for any other American vehicle before or since.
 </p>
 <p>
  Malowick was able to survive financially by his relatively high wholesale price, and a low overhead provided in part by engines and chassis pirated from Chrysler warehouses in northern Illinois (accounting partially for Chrysler’s bewildering stock nose dive during and immediately after their “forward look” phase), and from sales to special collectors and customizers, mostly in California, who were willing to pay anything for a
  <nobr>
   ’57 Chevy
  </nobr>
  in good condition.
 </p>
 <p>
  By far Malowick’s most successful model was, of course, the
  <nobr>
   2-door
  </nobr>
  <nobr>
   Bel Air
  </nobr>
  with the metallic plum paint, many which can be seen on the streets of most American cities today.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 1967, Malowick was forced to close down shop because of rising costs and the rumors that General Motors was wise to his operations and was preparing legal action.
 </p>
 <p>
  Malowick has since gone into the business of manufacturing denim boots and book bags, but he is considering another automobile operation if he can locate favorable conditions, possibly in Germany.  There is a rumor that the giant Volkswagen Corporation, which has thought about opening a factory in the U.S., has made overtures to Malowick regarding the 1973 Buick Riviera, another classic of American design.
