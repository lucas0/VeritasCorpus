  A photograph purportedly showing a frozen Alaskan tree frog has been circulating on the Internet since at least 2013, frequently accompanied by a brief sentence explaining how this amazing amphibian supposedly survives the harsh arctic winters:

   The Alaskan tree frog. Freezes solid in winter, its heart stopping, then thaws in spring and merrily hops off.

  While there is a species of frog in Alaska that can survive the area’s harsh winters, that species is not the “Alaskan tree frog.” According to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, that state is home to two species of

  There is, however, an amphibian that lives in Alaska and has an unusually high tolerance for freezing conditions. In

  long winters in Alaska:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   There are a number of creatures, from reptiles and insects to marine life, that possess some level of freeze tolerance, but few can perform the trick quite like Rana sylvatica. The tiny amphibians can survive for weeks with an incredible two-thirds of their body water completely frozen — to the point where they are essentially solid frogsicles.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even more incredible is the fact that the wood frogs stop breathing and their hearts stop beating entirely for days to weeks at a time. In fact, during its period of frozen winter hibernation, the frogs’ physical
   <nobr>
    processes — from metabolic activity to waste
    <nobr>
     production — grind to a near halt. What’s more, the frogs are likely to endure multiple freeze/ thaw episodes over the course of a winter.

   The way wood frogs avoid freezing to death is due to so-called cryoprotectants — solutes
