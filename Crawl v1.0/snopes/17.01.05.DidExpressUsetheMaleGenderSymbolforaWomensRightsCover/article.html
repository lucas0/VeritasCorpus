  On 5 January 2017, an image purportedly showing the cover of
  <em>
   Express,
  </em>
  a free daily newspaper produced by the
  <em>
   Washington Post,
  </em>
  was widely circulated on social media. The image showed a group of women forming the shape of the male gender symbol, despite the fact that the cover story was about a women’s rights march planned for the day after President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration:

  The image was widely circulated by viewers poking fun at
  <em>
   Express
  </em>
  for their mistake, but the glaring and seemingly obvious error caused some to wonder if the purported cover image was real.

  The graphic reproduced above does show a real cover produced for the
  <em>
   Express
  </em>
  story on a women’s rights march. It was marketed as a “Print Edition” by the
  <em>
   Washington Post
  </em>
  was reportedly passed out to

  Shortly after the image went viral, the
  <em>
   Express
  </em>
  issued an apology via Twitter and shared a new version of the cover featuring a group of women standing in the shape of the female gender symbol:
 </p>
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
  <p dir="ltr" lang="en">
   This is how the cover should have looked. We apologize for the mistake.
