  by the courts. But would he go so far as to try to stop his own impeachment through an executive order? That’s what the entertainment web site News Werthy appeared to

   report

  on 29 May 2017:

Apparently outraged by mountains of bad press and talks of impeachment, the President is trying to find a way to use the powers of Executive Order to put a stop to it altogether.

  <p>
   Trump stated, “I want to draft an Executive Order which will just take away their ability to impeach me. So, I need you to help me word this the right way.” With the entire room flabbergasted, he went on to explain, “That way they will have no choice but to just get this stupid idea out of their heads, right?”
