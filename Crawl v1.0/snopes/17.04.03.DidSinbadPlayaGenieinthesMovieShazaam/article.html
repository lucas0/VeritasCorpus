  A popular internet theory holds that actor David Adkins, better known as the comedian Sinbad, played a genie in a popular children’s movie released sometime in the 1990s called
  <em>
   Shazaam
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Although this movie does not actually exist, social media users have circulated an image in an attempt to fool viewers into believing the film is real:

  Despite the total lack of evidence that any such film starring Sinbad was ever made — no extant footage, no still shots documenting its creation, no news articles or movie reviews mentioning it, it has no entry in the Internet Movie Database (
  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005435/?ref_=nmmi_mi_nm" target="_blank">
   IMDb
  </a>
  ), and

   Sinbad

  himself has stated that he never played a genie in a movie called
  <em>
   Shazaam
  </em>
  — many people still they remember seeing the movie.
 </p>
 <p>
  But why?
 </p>
 <p>
  While we cannot pinpoint an exact origin of this collective false memory, several circumstantial aspects suggest why people may mistakenly recall Sinbad’s having starred in a genie movie.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   The name:
  </strong>
  Depending on when you grew up, the name “Sinbad” likely recalls memories of one of two things: either a popular 1990s comedian, or a fictional sailor who had adventures (sometimes involving genies) in the Middle East. It is possible that some viewers have conflated the two characters in recalling a 1990s-era film about a genie.

 <p>
  Sinbad himself did once host a showing of the movie
  <em>
   Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger
  </em>
  on TNT in 1994:

  Sinbad appeared in several popular childrens’ movies in the 1990s, so it would not be particularly surprising if some viewers mistakenly remembered him in this particular genie film (which, naturally, would not go unnoticed by Internet pranksters). In fact, a preview for
  <em>
   Kazaam
  </em>
  was reportedly featured during the previews on some VHS copies of the Sinbad movie
  <em>
   The First Kid
  </em>

  It appears that this Sinbad-genie phenomenon is another instance of  the “
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2016/07/24/the-mandela-effect/" target="_blank">
   Mandela Effect
  </a>
  ,” an informal term for a collective false memory. The term was coined by a woman who discovered that she and hundreds of other people believed, and remembered, that Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela had died in prison in the 1980s.  Mandela actually died in 2013, after serving as South Africa’s first black
