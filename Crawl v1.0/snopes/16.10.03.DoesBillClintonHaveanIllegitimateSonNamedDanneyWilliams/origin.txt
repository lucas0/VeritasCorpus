  The Globe interviewed Danneyâ€™s mother, a former prostitute named Bobbie Ann Williams, who told the story of how she allegedly met and began a relationship with Clinton in 1984.
 </p>
 <p>
  She says Clinton went out for a run one day in Little Rock, when he jogged by her housing project and introduced himself to her. She was 24 years old at the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  A few days later, Clinton allegedly jogged by the housing project again and paid Bobbie $200 for her to have sex with him behind some bushes.
 </p>
 <p>
  After that, Bobbie says that she and Clinton regularly had sex, sometimes alone, sometimes with other female partners.
