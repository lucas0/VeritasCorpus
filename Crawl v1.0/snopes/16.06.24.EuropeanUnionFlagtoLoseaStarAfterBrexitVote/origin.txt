<blockquote>
 <p>
  The European flag symbolises both the European Union and, more broadly, the identity and unity of Europe.
 </p>
 <p>
  It features a circle of 12 gold stars on a blue background. They stand for the ideals of unity, solidarity and harmony among the peoples of Europe.
 </p>
 <p>
  The number of stars has nothing to do with the number of member countries, though the circle is a symbol of unity.
