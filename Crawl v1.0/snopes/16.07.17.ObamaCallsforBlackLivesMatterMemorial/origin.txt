  What do you think about President Obama’s new executive order that calls for a new memorial to be built honoring the Black victims of Police murder in The United States?
 </p>
 <p>
  The new ‘Black Lives Matter Wall’ will be in Washington D.C. and will be a virtual clone of the already existing Black Wall Memorial honoring veterans of the Vietnam War.

  “On every front there are clear answers out there”, Obama said in a Friday news conference,” that can make this country stronger, but we’re going to break through the fear and the frustration Black people are feeling.I believe this new memorial will honor the victims of racist Police murderers.”
