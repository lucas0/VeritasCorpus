  Last year Target.com announced that they would be delivering to Israel, which made everyone in Israel excited, but now the Jerusalem based, Janglo forum is reporting, that Target made a decision to block all Israeli computers from being able to view their website.

  Anyone from Israel who tries to access the site gets an “Access Denied” message … When Jennifer Bayer tried to access Target’s site she got an “Access Denied” message. After her friends confirmed that they were having the same problem, she contacted Target directly for an answer.

  Yael W. a graphics designer from Israel had the same issue and so did her friends. She was extremely frustrated because OS NEWS reached out to Yael and asked her what she thinks about the Israel ban … Chani Hadad, an English Instructor at Touro College in Israel said “Why does Target have a problem with Israel that Amazon, Old Navy, Next Direct, etc. does not?”
