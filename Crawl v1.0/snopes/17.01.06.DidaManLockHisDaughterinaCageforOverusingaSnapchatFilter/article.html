 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   According to reports, Monica Cruz, 17 of Washington Heights, was found in locked in a cage in her bedroom. Cruz was initially discovered by grandmother Odalys Cruz this evening after the teen had not responded to calls from her grandmother for several days. The grandmother had visited the home while both parents were at work to check in on her grand daughter … Reports indicates that the teen was locked in the cage for 3 days and was fed Purina Dog Chow and water from a bowl. Monica had not bathed for the duration of lock up and had taken bowel movements inside the cage which was lined with newspaper.
  </p>
  <p>
   Detective Santiago spoke with Cruz’s parents to investigate the incident.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Mr. Cruz explained to me that he found several photos on his daughter’s Facebook page that made her look like a dog. He asked some friends at his job about what it was and they told him that it was an app that gave the photos the effect. Mr. Cruz was not happy that his daughter would choose to look like a dog on the internet which prompted him to take extreme measures in an attempt to discipline his daughter,” said Detective Santiago.
