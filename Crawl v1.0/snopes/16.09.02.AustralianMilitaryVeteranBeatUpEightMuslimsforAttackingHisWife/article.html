  In September 2016, an online image was circulated online making the claim that an Australian veteran named Kyle Tyrrell had “beat the living shit out of 8 Muslims single-handedly after the Muslims attacked his wife.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The claim originated with a January 2016 altercation that occurred on a beach known as Cosy Corner, in the Australian coastal town of Torquay. While it’s unclear exactly how many people were involved in the scuffle or how anybody could tell the purported harassers were Muslim just by looking at them, local news media reported that Tyrrell sent one person, not eight, to the hospital with injuries. And while the reports said police were investigating the incident, we found no follow-ups detailing the outcome of that investigation. We have reached out to Victoria police for records on the incident but have not yet received a response.

  Whatever transpired, the incident has become an anti-Muslim rallying cry on social media and on

  white supremacist web sites. But while an anti-Muslim statement was attributed to Tyrrell, we found no evidence that he had actually posted it.

  According to local news reports from January, the incident apparently started over a disagreement about the legality of catching crabs in the area:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Mrs Tyrrell, 30, said on seeing one of the men put a crab pot in the water, she told him the area was a marine sanctuary and fishing was banned.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Liana said nicely to him that if you put that in there, you may get in trouble, as you are not meant to have it. That was it, and he turned on her,” Mr Tyrrell said.
  </p>
  <p>
   He said he heard his wife’s screams and, seeing a man attacking her, ran to her aid. After he got the man into a headlock, he said up to eight other men ran in.
  </p>

   The war veteran, a qualified instructor in the martial art of Krav Maga, said he ended up on the ground and was kicked in the head. The couple believe the attack was racially and culturally motivated.
