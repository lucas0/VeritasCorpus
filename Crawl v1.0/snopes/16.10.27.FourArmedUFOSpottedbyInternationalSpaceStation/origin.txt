  Commenting on this latest video UFO blogger, Scott C. Waring noted on his UFO Sightings Daily blog that the alien ship has a huge main body with four individual prongs which look like arms.

  “This UFO was spotted by UFO researcher Streetcap1 of YouTube, ” Waring wrote. “The video shows a long-armed UFO in the distance.”

  According to the prolific alien hunter, the video also shows that our own sunlight reflects from the body and arms of the UFO, causing it to glisten which proves the authenticity of the video. The reflective properties of the mysterious object confirm its existence, and the object was seen for only a few seconds before NASA’s infamous blue screen appeared.

  “I feel that the public is trusting NASA less and less when it comes to revealing life on other planets, ” Waring said. “Their true goal seems to be to gather important intelligence, and drip feeds the public enough to satisfy their curiosity.”

  Other UFO and alien enthusiasts noticed that there was a similarity between this “four armed UFO” and a UFO that has in the past been sighted, multiple times, flying past the sun on NASA SOHO images.
