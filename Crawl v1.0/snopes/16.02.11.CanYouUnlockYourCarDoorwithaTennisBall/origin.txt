  One of the most frustrating things you can do is lock your keys in your car. You know you do it almost the second it happens. Your options are pretty much limited to calling a tow service to come unlock it (with someone elseâ€™s phone of course, because your is locked in the car), trying to use a coat hanger, because that almost never works anyway, or get a ride home to get the other set of keys in your locked house.

  If none of those sound appealing, you might want to give this a try. Take a tennis ball, puncture a small hole in it. Place the hole of the ball over the keyhole and using both hands, press the ball very hard. The air inside the ball forces the locking mechanism open and your car becomes unlocked.
