  In February 2016 social media users began sharing videos and articles displaying an interesting (but not new) claim, holding that motorists could unlock their car doors using just a tennis ball.

 <p>
  A typical version explains how the tennis ball car door hack supposedly works:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   One of the most frustrating things you can do is lock your keys in your car. You know you do it almost the second it happens. Your options are pretty much limited to calling a tow service to come unlock it (with someone else’s phone of course, because your is locked in the car), trying to use a coat hanger, because that almost never works anyway, or get a ride home to get the other set of keys in your locked house.
  </p>
  <p>
   If none of those sound appealing, you might want to give this a try. Take a tennis ball, puncture a small hole in it. Place the hole of the ball over the keyhole and using both hands, press the ball very hard. The air inside the ball forces the locking mechanism open and your car becomes unlocked.

  The video showed a vehicle being locked with a key fob before advising female viewers on how to make a “magic” tennis ball for lost keys. The clip instructed women to keep the ball in their purses at all times (instead of just an extra set of keys) and explained how the hack purportedly worked:
