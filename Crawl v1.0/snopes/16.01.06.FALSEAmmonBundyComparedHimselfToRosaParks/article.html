  On 5 January 2016, a Twitter account purportedly belonging to Ammon Bundy, a Phoenix

  who led a group of armed men in the

  of a government building at Oregon’s Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, posted a message comparing his actions to those of civil rights leader Rosa Parks:

  While the above-displayed message was posted by the Twitter account @Ammon_Bundy, it doesn’t appear that the rancher has anything to do with the account.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, this is a brand new Twitter account which was started on 3 January 2016. While it is possible that Bundy would start a new Twitter account to take advantage of the media attention, the rancher has had a
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1115723640" target="_blank">
   Facebook
  </a>
  account for more than a year and frequently uses the social network to provide updates from Oregon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Second, the @Ammon_Bundy Twitter account uses a screenshot from one of Bundy’s videos as its profile pic. If the account were real, it’s likely that Bundy would have used an actual photo.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, MSNBC reporter Tony Dokoupil, who has been reporting from the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge since shortly after Bundy’s men took over the building,

   confirmed

  that the account was fake:

  While it’s possible that someone associated with the Bundy is operating the @Ammon_Bundy Twitter account, it’s more likely that the account is being operated by a remote sympathizer.
