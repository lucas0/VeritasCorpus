   A patient in Zimbabwe had serious chest pains, after taking x-ray at Rusape General hospital the image showed that he had a live cockroach in his chest moving about. Doctors recommended that he goes abroad preferably India.So patient had to sale his house and a few contributions from relatives. When he got to India another x-ray was taken and was told there was no cockroach in his chest but the cockroach was in the x-ray machine they used in Zimbabwe.

   A man went to a Ghanaian hospital for Check up. The x-ray showed he had a cockroach in his chest region and he was told by the doctor dat he wud need surgery to remove it.
   <br>
    After putting much tót to it,he went abroad for a second opinion:He had anoda x-ray check,and was told that the cockroach was in the Ghanaian hospital’s x-ray machine, not in his chest!..

  Although it’s unclear when this image first accompanied the health care joke, the original chest x-ray did not feature a cockroach. This x-ray was taken in 1954 and showed
