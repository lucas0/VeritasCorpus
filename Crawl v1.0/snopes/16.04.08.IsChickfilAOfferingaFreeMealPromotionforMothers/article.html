  version of the rumor, adding the following information:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The locations on 59 close to Deerbrook mall and also the one on Beltway 8 and Wilson Rd both in Humble, Tx offer it.I’m not sure if any others do but you can always check to see.

  As expected, Chick-fil-A’s Facebook wall was swamped with pregnant people and others wondering whether the freebie was real:

  We contacted Chick-fil-A about the rumor, and on 8 April 2016, a company representative told us that the offer was real, but (so far) appeared to be limited to one area:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Thanks so much for reaching out about this. We are looking into it, but as of now, it looks like this offer is available only at one location in Houston, Texas. Each independent franchisee offers different customer promotions, so we are confirming with that location.
