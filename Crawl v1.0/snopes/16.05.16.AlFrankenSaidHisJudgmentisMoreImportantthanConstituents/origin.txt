 <p>
  TAPPER: … Senator Sanders won the Minnesota caucuses. You have endorsed Hillary Clinton. You are a superdelegate. What do you make of the argument put forward by the Sanders campaign that superdelegates who represent states that Sanders has won should consider voting for the candidate supported by Democratic voters in their state?
 </p>
 <p>
  FRANKEN: Well, superdelegates are part of our system. I haven’t read that in the rules, that interpretation.
 </p>
 <p>
  TAPPER: You can vote for whoever you want.
 </p>
 <p>
  FRANKEN: Right.
 </p>
 <p>
  TAPPER: But they’re saying shouldn’t you, as a senator of Minnesota, follow the lead of the voters, the Democratic voters who turned out for the Minnesota caucuses?
 </p>
 <p>
  FRANKEN: I think Democratic voters who elected me to the Senate want me to exercise my judgment on who I think would be the best president of the United States, and I think that person is Hillary Clinton.
