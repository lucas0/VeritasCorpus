 <p>
  Kanye West is wanted for questioning by police as a suspect in the Paris robbery case after more evidence has emerged suggesting the jewelry theft was an “inside job.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Police believe somebody close to Kim Kardashian helped tip off the thieves and Kanye West, though performing at Meadows Festival in New York at the time, has been summoned to the French capital for questioning.
 </p>
 <p>
  A police source, describing the case as “
  <i>
   one of the strangest
  </i>
  ” they have worked on, said Kanye has “
  <i>
   been evasive
  </i>
  ” and has yet to agree to dates for his hearing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The bad news for Kanye is that the United States does have an extradition treaty with France, although there has been a history of reluctance on both sides to honor it.
