  President Trump’s decision to

  Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on 6 December 2017 drew sharp criticism around the world. As the United Nations General Assembly

   resolution
  </a>
  condemning the United State’s position, Nikki Haley, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, announced that she would be “

  aid to Palestinians.

   “In Gaza, children like me grow in an environment laden with challenges and in an unbelievable way. Many of our parents suffer to find job opportunities or strive hard to put some food on the table,” Assaf said in his U.N. address.

  <p>
   “There are also the struggle, the isolation and the blockade. Sometimes it seems as if there is no escape,” he added.
