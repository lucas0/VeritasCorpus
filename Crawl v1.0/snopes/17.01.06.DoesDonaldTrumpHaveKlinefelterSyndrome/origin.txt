  Testosterone is the hormone that directs male sexual development before birth and during puberty. A shortage of testosterone can lead to delayed or incomplete puberty, breast enlargement (gynecomastia), reduced facial and body hair, and an inability to have biological children (infertility). Some affected individuals also have genital differences including undescended testes (cryptorchidism), the opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis (hypospadias), or an unusually small penis (micropenis).

  Older children and adults with
  <span class="ghr-condition">
   Klinefelter syndrome
  </span>
  tend to be taller than their peers. Compared with unaffected men, adults with
  <span class="ghr-condition">
   Klinefelter syndrome
  </span>
  have an increased risk of developing
  <a href="https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/breast-cancer" target="_blank">
   breast cancer
  </a>
  and a chronic inflammatory disease called
  <a href="https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/systemic-lupus-erythematosus" target="_blank">
   systemic lupus erythematosus
  </a>
  . Their chance of developing these disorders is similar to that of women in the general population.

  Children with

  may have learning disabilities and delayed speech and language development. They tend to be quiet, sensitive, and unassertive, but personality characteristics vary among affected individuals.
