  Bigger than any specific people, there’s a war on women that’s happening in this country, starting with basic abortion rights, freedom to choose, that we fought for in the sixties and seventies, that women died for, bleeding in back alleys from hanger abortions. Women fought for equality in this country, and right now, politically, it’s being taken away from us, and it doesn’t help with you guys thinking, “Oh, that woman who showed the blood, the menstruation blood — ew, that was disgusting, she’s not fun to have dinner with. Come on, ladies.
