  Turmeric, which has been the subject of thousands of studies and perhaps even more memes, came up again recently when an image circulated claiming that the spice prevents dementia, and that because of its curative powers, India has the lowest rate of dementia in the world.

  The meme, like a lot of claims about turmeric’s curative properties, relies on a large body of research that scientists have recently called into question.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Most turmeric studies have focused on curcumin, which appears in high concentrations in the root, and other similar chemicals called curcuminoids. Many of these curcumin studies employ a laboratory technique called
  <a href="https://www.scripps.edu/florida/technologies/hts/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    High Throughput Screening

  </a>
  (HTS) that allows researchers to test how curcumin responds to chemicals representing different bodily functions.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  These types of studies have suggested that curcumin can treat conditions ranging from diabetes to HIV. One study
  <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b00975" target="_blank">
   summed
  </a>
  up the findings in this astonishing list:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   Curcumin has been reported to have activity for the following indications: anti-inflammatory, anti-HIV, antibacterial, antifungal, nematocidal, antiparasitic, antimutagenic, antidiabetic, antifibrinogenic, radioprotective, wound healing, lipid lowering, antispasmodic, antioxidant, immunomodulating, anticarcinogenic, and Alzheimer’s disease, among others.

 <p class="p1">
  Curcumin is part of a group of chemicals called pan-assay interference compounds (or

 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Even if false positives weren’t a problem, curcumin and curcuminoids are both unstable and not very potent in the human body, making them unlikely to be effective as a treatment.

  Kathryn M. Nelson, a principal scientist at the University of Minnesota’s Institute for Therapeutics Discovery and Development and the author of the 2017 review of curcumin explained:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   Curcumin’s bioavailability — the amount that makes its way throughout the body — is “dismal,” Nelson says. The chemical is fragile, and once it’s ingested, it’s quickly excreted. “The compound itself is probably not doing anything,” she adds. “It falls apart in water. Think about how well it’s going to survive your stomach” and its acids.

 <p class="p1">
  For these and other reasons, research on the benefits of turmeric and curcumin remain far from settled, despite the large amount of literature on the topic.

   How Would Turmeric Treat Dementia?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Setting aside for a moment the problems with calculating the rate of dementia in India and the problems with HTS studies of curcumin, how would curcumin cure dementia? There are two main theories. The first

  ) anti-inflammatory properties:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   Research to date suggests that chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and most chronic diseases are closely linked, and the antioxidant properties of curcumin can play a key role in the prevention and treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  Another, related, hypothesis suggests that curcumin could stimulate the immune system to more efficiently remove the buildup in the brain of chemicals that produce amyloid plaques, which are thought to contribute to dementia. Some studies suggest that when you have Alzheimer’s, your white blood cells can’t efficiently

  </a>
  in animals and in laboratory settings hinted that curcumin could stimulate the immune system to do so.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, there have been no controlled, double-blind, clinical trials on humans that support this claim outside of the lab. In terms of clinical research on humans, a

   After 24 weeks of treatment, there was no observed difference in mental status between the placebo and treated groups based on several measurements of cognitive status.

  “To our knowledge, [curcumin] has never been shown to be conclusively effective in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial for any indication,” Nelson and her colleagues
