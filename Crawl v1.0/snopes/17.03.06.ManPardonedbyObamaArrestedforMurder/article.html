  On 28 February 2017, the Underground Report web site published an article positing that a Florida drug trafficker who had been pardoned by President Obama was re-arrested three months later on charges that he had murdered his girlfriend:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Just 94 days ago, James G. Winters of Gainesville, FL was pardoned from a life sentence by former President Barack Obama.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yesterday Winters was arrested for the murder of his girlfriend, Joanna Walker.
  </p>
  <p>
   Walker was reported missing by family early last week. Her body was discovered on Sunday, in the trunk of an abandoned 1998 Toyato Corrola in an Orlando Publix parking lot.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though the tags were removed the car was traced by to Winters and Officers made the subsequent arrest, booking Winters on one count of first degree murder.
  </p>
  <p>
   During his presidency, Obama granted pardons or clemency to an unprecedented 1,927 criminals.
  </p>
  <p>
   James Winters was serving a life sentence for drug trafficking and weapons charges.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  None of this was true. No one by the name of James G. Winters was
  <a href="https://www.justice.gov/pardon/obama-pardons" target="_blank">
   pardoned
  </a>
  by President Obama or arrested on murder charges in Florida in February 2017. The photograph of “James G. Winters” that accompanied the article was actually a picture of a man named Avery Draughty, who was

   arrested
  </a>
  in California in March 2015 and charged with a killing that had taken place over a year earlier.

 <p>
  The only source reporting this information was the
  <a href="http://archive.is/oewWx" target="_blank">
   Underground Report
  </a>
  , a known fake news site. So known, in fact, that at the foot of every article the site’s creation has since added a link to a
  <a href="http://undergroundnewsreport.com/the-truth/breaking-satire-makes-fools-gullible-trump-supporters/" target="_blank">
   page
  </a>
  explaining his deliberate spread of fabricated reports (and the public’s reception of them):
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   When I started this [fake news] site, I had no idea that the stories would garner this much attention. While writing them, I was aiming for stories that no one would believe, but rather would be satirical in an age where disinformation is so prevalent. Just for fun, I decided to post some of the stories in Trump fan groups on Facebook to see the reactions.
  </p>
  <p>
   To my surprise, the Trump masses embraced my stories as fact, almost universally. It seemed that there wasn’t anything I could write that was too wild or outrageous to be believed by this particular audience.
  </p>
  <p>
   If I wrote about CNN being fake news and connected to ISIS, readers would agree wholeheartedly with my fabricated article. If I wrote about a black liberal or Obama supposedly saying something controversial, the response was unbridled racism and hatred. When I wrote about Hillary Clinton’s new emails that proved she was a child sacrificing maniac, people screamed for her head.
