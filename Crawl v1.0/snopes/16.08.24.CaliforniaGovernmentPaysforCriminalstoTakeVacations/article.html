  The city of Richmond, California piloted a
  <a href="http://ca-richmond.civicplus.com/2410/More-about-ONS-Strategic-Initiatives" target="_blank">
   program
  </a>
  starting in 2010, known as Operation Peacemaker, with the stated goal of bringing down gun violence. Young people considered at risk to commit crimes are tapped to participate in a fellowship program, where after six months they can earn a stipend if they succeed.

  The program’s founder and then-director, Devon Boggan, wrote about the concept in a 4 July 2015 editorial for the

  <p>
   The deal we offered was this: If they kept their commitment to us for six months — attended meetings, stayed out of trouble, responded to our mentoring — they became eligible to earn up to $1,000 a month for a maximum of nine months.
