  The photograph of a homeowner trapped by a fallen ladder while installing Christmas decorations has been circulated by viewers wondering whether it was a real picture of hapless decorator, and by others who believed it to be (as suggested by the accompanying example text) merely a picture of a humorous Christmas display:
