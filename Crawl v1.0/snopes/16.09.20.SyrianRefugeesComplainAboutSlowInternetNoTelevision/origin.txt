  This is not a life when you get inside to a room without a TV. Just a bed, there is no fridge … no lockers, no privacy. … We’re going to stay outside because we don’t want to eat this food, and we don’t want to stay in the room. We’re running away from our country because of the situation, and now we live in a jail … Maybe we should go back to our country … I think it’s fair enough.
