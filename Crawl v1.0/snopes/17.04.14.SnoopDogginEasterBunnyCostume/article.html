  A photograph purportedly showing musician Snoop Dogg in an Easter Bunny costume carrying a basket full of marijuana (rather than the more traditional cache of eggs) has been circulating online several years, typically reappearing in social media every year around Easter. The image received a boost in popularity (and faux credibility) when the musician posted it to his

  Although this photograph is frequently shared as a genuine one, this image has clearly been manipulated. The original picture from which it was created featured neither Snoop Dogg nor a basket of marijuana:

  A second image of the same costume in the same locale confirms that the person pictured inside the Easter Bunny suit was originally someone other than Snoop Dogg:
