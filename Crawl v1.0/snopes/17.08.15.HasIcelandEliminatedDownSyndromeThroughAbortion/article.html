  On 14 August 2017, CBS News ran a
  <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/down-syndrome-iceland/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    segment
   </span>
  </a>
  for their program “CBSN: On Assignment” in which correspondent Elaine Quijano traveled to Iceland to report on that country’s disappearing incidence of Down syndrome:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   Since prenatal screening tests were introduced in Iceland in the early 2000s, the vast majority of women — close to 100 percent — who received a positive test for Down syndrome terminated their pregnancy.
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   While the tests are optional, the government states that all expectant mothers must be informed about availability of screening tests, which reveal the likelihood of a child being born with Down syndrome. Around 80 to 85 percent of pregnant women choose to take the prenatal screening test, according to Landspitali University Hospital in Reykjavik.

  Some took this story and
  <a href="http://archive.is/gpGAO" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    branded

  it as being about a mandated eugenics program. Others misrepresented the nature of the report itself. Lifesitenews.com, for example, ran the factually inaccurate

    headline

  “Iceland kills 100% of babies with Down syndrome in abortion: New report.”
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  The report does not suggest that, however. It suggests that
  <em>
   nearly
  </em>
  100 percent of the 80 to 85 percent of
  <em>
   people
  </em>
  <i>
   who take the test and
  </i>
  <em>
   test positive for Down Syndrome
  </em>
  choose to abort their pregnancy. There are similar termination rates after fetal diagnoses of Down syndrome in other European countries. In Denmark, for example, the rate is about 98 percent, CBS News reported. In the United States, for comparison’s sake, the rate of mothers choosing to terminate their pregnancy after receiving a Down syndrome diagnosis is about

  “Babies with Down syndrome are still being born in Iceland,” Hulda Hjartardottir, head of the Prenatal Diagnosis Unit at Landspitali University Hospital, in which around 70 percent of Icelandic children are born, told CBS News.
