  My grandma lived to be 102. She told us in her days, the early 1900’s they ate vanilla ice cream in it’s Original Color but when she reached a teen, 1912, it changed to White. She said White people couldn’t tolerate eating something that tasted Soooooo delicious being black, so started your “Added Preservatives”
