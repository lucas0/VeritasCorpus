  A common trolling tactic on Twitter is to create an account that slightly alters the Twitter handle of a well-known personality. In this case, the @AddamScheft3r account added an extra “d” to the name and replaced an “E” with a “3.” These small changes can easily be missed by social media users skimming through their feeds.

  Although this spoof account fooled many people at first blush, it does provide several hints about its lack of authenticity. The profile, for instance, simply read “made you look.” The account also posted a tweet warning people about fake accounts:

  Shortly after this article was published, the fake Adam Schefter account was deleted and replaced with an account mimicking Pro Football Talk’s

  account employed the same tactic, replacing a letter with a number, to make it appear as if the tweets came from the genuine account. In this case, the “o” in “Pro” was replaced with a zero:
