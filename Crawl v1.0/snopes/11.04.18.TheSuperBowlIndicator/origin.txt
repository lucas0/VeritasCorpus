 <p>
  [1] Super Bowl victories by the AFC’s Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Baltimore Ravens (formerly the Cleveland Browns) count as NFL wins which predict a rise in the stock market because those teams originated in the NFL prior to its merger with the AFL.

 <p>
  [2] The 2003 Super Bowl has been excluded from these calculations because that year’s winner, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was an expansion team that originated in neither the NFL nor the AFL. To complicate matters even further, the Bucs started out as an AFC team in 1976 before moving to the NFC the following year.
