  If you’re not from Wichita, Kansas then you probably haven’t heard of Mulvane, Kansas unless, of course, you’re Oscar winning Hollywood actor Matthew McConaughey. Mr. McConaughey announced in an interview yesterday that he is actually moving to the small town of Mulvane, located 25 miles south of Wichita. “I like Kansas and I like the people there. The people there are real. They’re genuine and I don’t have to question their sincerity and I think it would be a hell of a great place to raise my family.”

  We’re told that Mr. McConaughey discovered the town while driving through the area not long ago and apparently fell in love with the small town and the state of Kansas. We’re not sure what the residents of the town will think about his move there but we imagine he’ll be received with a warm welcome. If nothing else, having such a famous resident will undoubtedly be a bit of an economic boon for the town.
