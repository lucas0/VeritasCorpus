  In December 2015, the web site TruthStreamMedia.com published an article claiming that (as of December 2015) there have been “more mass shootings under President Obama than the four previous Presidents combined,” as well as a much greater incidence of mass shootings involving eight or more victims:
 </p>
 <blockquote>

   Mass Shootings under the Last Five Presidents
  </p>
  <p>
   Ronald Reagan: 1981-1989 (8 years) 11 mass shootings
   <br>
    Incidents with 8 or more deaths = 5
   </br>
  </p>
  <p>
   George H. W. Bush: 1989-1993 (4 years) 12 mass murders
   <br/>
   Incidents with 8 or more deaths = 3
  </p>
  <p>
   Bill Clinton: 1993-2001 (8 years) 23 mass murders
   <br/>
   Incidents with 8 or more deaths = 4
  </p>
  <p>
   George W. Bush: 2001-2009 (8 years) 20 mass murders
   <br/>
   Incidents with 8 or more deaths = 5
  </p>
  <p>
   Barrack H. Obama: 2009-2015 (in 7th year) 162 mass murders
   <br/>
   Incidents with 8 or more deaths = 18

  However, the sources listed by TruthStreamMedia.com did not back up their claims that a much larger number of mass shootings had taken place during the administration of Barack Obama than during the administrations of his four predecessors combined. TruthStreamMedia.com seriously fudged the numbers by applying different standards for “mass shootings” to the years during which Barack Obama has served as President.
 </p>
 <p>
  The numbers for President Obama include many killings that are not considered “mass shootings” by common definition but are instead classified as “multiple homicides” or “mass killings” (including many instances of familicide, in which one person kills an entire family, typically his own). Moreover, in January 2013 a mandate for federal investigation of mass shootings authorized by President Obama changed the previous definition of what constitutes a “mass shooting” event by lowering the minimum number of victims from four to three, thereby increasing the number of such incidents so classified during President Obama’s second term.

    Mother Jones
   </a>
  </em>
  ‘ database of “US Mass Shootings, 1982-2016” shows that 31 mass shootings took place in the United States during the seven-year span from the start of President Obama’s first term through the end of 2015, four of which would not have been counted as such using previous standards. Of those 27 (not 162) mass shootings, eleven (not eighteen) involved the deaths of eight or more people.

If we
that 162 mass shootings had occurred during President Obama's tenure in the White House to date.  recorded only 25 mass shootings during that time, Wikipedia had no "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_killings" target="_blank">postal killings</a>" recorded since Obama took office, and the list of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mass_shootings_in_the_United_States_by_year" target="_blank">Mass Shootings in the United States by Year</a>" recorded 47 such incidents between 2009 and 2015.

TruthStreamMedia.com fudged their numbers by loosening their definition of "mass shootings" to include domestic murders in the data for President Obama, but they excluded similar instances in the data for his predecessors. For <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/27/ervin-antonio-lupoe-kills_n_161446.html" target="_blank">example</a>, one entry under President Obama lists "Ervin Lupoe," who killed his wife and five children in 2009, but this incident was not listed by either Wikipedia nor <em>Mother Jones</em> because it is not <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map" target="_blank">classified</a> as a "mass shooting" by their definitions of the term:


<blockquote>Our focus is on public mass shootings in which the motive appeared to be indiscriminate killing. We used the following criteria to identify cases:


<ul>
 	

<li><strong>The shootings occurred in a public place. </strong>(Except in the case of a party on private property in Crandon, Wisconsin, and another in Seattle, where crowds of strangers had gathered.) Crimes primarily related to gang activity, armed robbery, or domestic violence in homes are not included.</li>


</ul>


</blockquote>


While Lupoe was included in President Obama's data set, similar cases, such as Christian Longo's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/17/us/oregon-man-guilty-of-killing-his-family-gets-death-sentence.html" target="_blank">murder</a> of his wife and three children in 2002, were excluded from the records of Obama's predecessors.

As we <a href="http://www.snopes.com/351-mass-shootings/" target="_blank">noted</a> in a previous article, quantifying the number of mass shootings is a difficult task because there is no universally agreed upon definition of a mass shooting. <a href="http://shootingtracker.com/wiki/Mass_Shootings_in_2015" target="_blank">ShootingTracker.com</a> includes any instance where four or more people were shot, the <a href="http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/about" target="_blank">GunViolenceArchive.org</a> records incidents where four or more people (excluding the shooter) were shot, and <em><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map" target="_blank">Mother Jones</a></em> records mass shootings as incidents resulting in the death of four or more people.

Although none of these definitions is wrong, it would be pointless to compare <em>Mother Jones</em>' numbers to ShootingTracker.com's without noting the discrepancies in definition. Moreover, whatever the definition of a mass shooting might be, TruthStreamMedia.com misled their readers by using one set of criteria for President Obama and another for his predecessors.
