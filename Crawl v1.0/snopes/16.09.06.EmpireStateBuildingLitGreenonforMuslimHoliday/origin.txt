  The Empire State Building is an iconic building in New York City often that lights up different colors throughout the year for various Holidays and special events. Many people donâ€™t realize that is has been lit Islamic green in the past to celebrate their most sacred of Holy days. With 9/11 approaching Obama has plans to light it Green once again which should infuriate most Americans considering he sides with Muslims on everything.
