  On 23 May 2017, the satirical web site
  <a href="http://archive.is/UM15v" target="_blank">
   Last Line of Defense
  </a>
  published an article claiming that Senate Minority Leader Charles “Chuck” Schumer was to resign “in disgrace.”
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Libtard Democrat Chuck Schumer will resign his seat as US Senator and Minority Leader this morning after learning that the White House has enough on him to ruin his marriage and send him to jail.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rather than face the backlash and vindictive response from the Trump administration to his requests to play ball, Schumer will resign, deny all of the allegations and spend the next 7 1/2 years under investigation by Trey Gowdy.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy led the House Select Committee investigation into the 2012 attacks on the US Embassy in Benghazi, Libya, and achieved prominence for his intensive questioning of Hillary Clinton.
