  This is an interview from 2011 with Donald Trump and Piers Morgan, i think that’s his name, the scum bag guy that worked with Alex Jones for the second amendment. Blah blah blah you know the story. Anyway, Donald Trump is doing the interview with this guy and out of the blue he mentions pizzagate. This is 2011. Pizzagate. It’s clear as a bell. You can’t miss it. Now I ran back through 2011 and I can’t find anything pizzagate related besides Donald Trump mentioning it.
