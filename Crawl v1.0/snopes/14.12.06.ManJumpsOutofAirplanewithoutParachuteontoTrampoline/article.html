  On 20 November 2014,
  <nobr>
   Sector 6
  </nobr>
  Sports
  <nobr>
   Venue &amp; Stadium

  posted a video on their
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/video.asp?v=1491533791111103" target="_blank">

  page of a man jumping from an airplane without a parachute, who — through the use of a magnetic steering system — ends up plummeting through a hole in the roof of a building and landing safely on a specially reinforced trampoline:

  The video quickly went viral, but many viewers were skeptical of its authenticity, and the company’s Facebook page filled with comments as people pondered the possibility of someone’s surviving a parachuteless plummet from an airplane.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although many doubters debated the
  <a href="http://hypertextbook.com/facts/JianHuang.shtml" target="_blank">
   mathematics
  </a>
  behind the stunt (e.g., the average velocity of a skydiver in a belly-to-earth free-fall position is
  <nobr>
   120 mph
  </nobr>
  ), the video was easily debunked by pondering three
  <nobr>
   non-scientific
  </nobr>
  components.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, the video featured a news clip from “Sky Newz,” which is not a real news media outlet. Second, the video just happened to end by promoting
  <nobr>
   Sector 6’s
  </nobr>
  new trampoline park in
  <nobr>
   New Orleans.
  </nobr>
  Finally,
  <nobr>
   Sector 6
  </nobr>
  uploaded the video with the title: “This really happened at our California park,” which was less than believable because
  <nobr>
   Sector 6
  </nobr>
  had no facility in California.
 </p>
 <p>
  The truth is that this video was merely a clever advertisement for a new trampoline park.  Its conceit was rivaled in real-life in July 2016, however, when

  jumped from an airplane at 25,000 feet without a parachute and landed safely in a giant net.
