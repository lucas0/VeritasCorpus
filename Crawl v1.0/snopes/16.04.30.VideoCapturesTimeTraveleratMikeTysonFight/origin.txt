  1995 fight between Mike Tyson and Peter McNeeley in Las Vegas. Someone in the crowd is seen taking a picture from what appears to a smart phone device, or a device way ahead of the 90’s. Aliens!!!

  I dunno if it’s a time traveller or not, but no one can explain what camera it is; a QV-100 doesn’t have a silver bit on the right, and this camera doesn’t seem to have a black line under the lens.
