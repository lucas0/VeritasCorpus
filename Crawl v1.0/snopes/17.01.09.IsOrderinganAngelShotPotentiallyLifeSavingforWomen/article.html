  One of the more common genres of modern folklore involves code or tricks that people in the know can employ against potential abusers to furtively summon help, exemplified most recently by a spike in chatter about the purported life-saving abilities of “angel shots” — a surreptitious device by which women who feel threatened by their dates can signal their need of assistance by issuing a code phrase under the guise of ordering a drink.

  Multiple news outlets promised to teach women how to use an “angel shot” to get out of a dangerous spot, and countless social media users shared the advice:

  that:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   If you’ve ever been on a bad date and needed an “emergency” excuse to walk out the door, then you’ll be even more relieved by a new, helpful trend sweeping bars across the globe. Not only are waitstaff helping women flee a bad date, they want to help keep you out of harm’s way.
  </p>
  <p>
   At Iberian Restaurant in St. Petersburg, FL, this means there is a discreet sign in the women’s restroom that reads “Is your Tinder date not who they said they were on their profile? Do you feel unsafe or even just a tad bit weird?” If so, the sign advises, order an “angel shot.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Wait, what is this mysterious drink? Well it’s actually not booze at all. It’s a code that will discreetly tell the bartender you need help, the Tampa Bay Times reports.
  </p>
  <p>
   Here’s how it works: Order an angel shot neat and a bartender will escort you to your car. Ask for it with ice and the bartender will call a taxi or Uber for you. Order it with lime and the restaurant staff will call the police.
  </p>
  <p>
   Apparently this code word was inspired by a similar movement in London, where women are “asking for Angela” to signal an unsafe situation during a date. It was created by The Lincolnshire Rape Crisis, a support service for women and girls in East England.

  We have not been able to verify the claim that “angel shots” are a “trend” that is “sweeping” bars, nor was that claim supported by examples provided in these viral articles. According to reports, this plan has been implemented only at a single venue in St. Petersburg, Florida, but the (hardly new) concept was represented as an escape hatch available to all women in any dangerous situation anywhere. Moreover, even the bar in question said no patrons had ever made use of the concept:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   So far, Iberian Restaurant’s owner Russell Andrade said no one has had to use the angel shot order. “I’m surprised to hear people are just talking about this,” he [said]. “We didn’t put the sign up for any attention. That sort of goes against the point.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The “angel shot” concept as broadly applied seems to have some less thought-through aspects. For one, issuing a clandestine call for help would generally only be necessary if a woman were within earshot of the individual she felt endangered by; otherwise, she could openly and directly ask for help instead of having to depend upon the chance that the bartender on duty knew the meaning of the “angel shot” code and that venue staff were trained to respond to it effectively. Another issue is that the viral online spreading of a piece of a lifesaving advice that depends (at least to some extent) on its covertness makes that advice equally available to putatively scary Tinder dates who might react to its attempted use with anger, thereby prolonging or worsening a bad situation before help can intervene:

<em>Good Housekeeping</em> referenced a 29 December 2016 <em>Tampa Bay Times</em> <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/retail/see-how-one-st-petersburg-restaurant-wants-to-help-women-escape-bad-dates/2307797" target="_blank">article</a>, but the original piece did not present the "angel shot" as indispensable advice for any woman at any bar everywhere:


<blockquote>That's the bold headline on a discreet sign in the women's restroom at the Iberian Rooster restaurant in downtown St. Petersburg.

"Is your Tinder or Plenty of Fish date not who they said they were on their profile?" The sign continues. "Do you feel unsafe, or even just a tad bit weird?"

Then order an angel shot, the sign says.

<strong>If a guest feels unsafe and needs help, the sign encourages them to order an angel shot at the bar or through their server at their table. That code will alert staff that someone is in need, Andrade said. The Iberian Rooster staff take this policy seriously, he added.</strong>

<strong>If a guest orders an angel shot neat, a bartender will escort them to their car. If they order it with ice, the bartender will call an Uber or a Taxi. Order it with lime and the restaurant staff will call the police.</strong></blockquote>


The Florida bar owner said the idea was inspired by a British rape crisis center's similar proposition, which was not so much about coded pleas as it was about educating people on their options in a potentially bad situation:


<blockquote>Andrade and his staff got the idea after a photo of a similar sign taken at a bar in England went viral on social media. The Lincolnshire Rape Crisis, a support service for women and girls in East England, created a poster campaign that was plastered in the stalls of restaurant and bar bathrooms. The posters urge women to approach bartenders and wait staff if they feel uncomfortable on a date. They also use a code word: Women can be discreet by "asking for Angela."</blockquote>


St. Petersburg's Iberian Restaurant implemented an idea specific to their location and about which staff was fully informed, but without that training the ploy was unworkable. As the comment above observed widespread adoption&nbsp;of identical code ensured both nervous women and their putative bad dates had equal access to the "secret," rendering it all but useless. Moreover, no portion of the plan was simpler than just plainly stating your situation to a security guard or staff member when out of earshot of your date or harasser. In that respect "angel shots" as a "trend" in "bars" proposed more harm than good, as innumerable women were exposed to poor advice&nbsp;suggesting that speaking in code was their best route to safety when unnerved in public. In the absence of evidence many or any other bars and&nbsp;restaurants adopted that specific code, its viral spread stood to provide a dangerously false sense of security.&nbsp;

  . All these notions exhibit the same weak points (i.e., scant reliability, widespread exposure) with little evidence that they have ever helped anyone to safety.

An even uglier undercurrent was impossible to miss in the above-quoted&nbsp;advice: women were presumed unable to walk out of an uncomfortable situation on their own steam. A popular iteration plainly stated offered the coded plea to anyone who&nbsp;"needed an 'emergency' excuse to walk out the door," implicitly asserting&nbsp;women would literally rather put their lives risk than offend a veritable stranger by leaving a date suddenly. The advice and the code were presented as more of a way to avoid embarrassment (albeit ineffectively) than risking displeasing someone by fabricating one's own excuse or simply making an honest exit from an uncomfortable setting. In that sense, it reinforced the belief being polite and being likable were more important than one's safety, even if accessing the latter meant speaking in code to placate the ego of a newly-acquired acquaintance. It seemed calling your own Uber and asking a staffer to keep you company until it arrived was more reliable advice for someone on a blind date with an unsettling person; "angel shots" only advanced the idea women ought not say "no" outright.&nbsp;

And the since-corrupted core concept was not one about codes or sparing a date offense, but women feeling secure in the knowledge they were empowered to leave dates for any reason or no reason at all:

"Angel shots," black dots, pizza orders, and other indirect pleas for assistance&nbsp;in a potentially dangerous situation had much in common but&nbsp;little to offer. The rumors themselves served&nbsp;as both a vocalization of and talisman against the risk&nbsp;of being stuck in an unsafe scenario, unable to summon help. Ploys of the sort inarguably&nbsp;required both cooperation and knowledge on the part of the plea's recipient (which we found no evidence was present anywhere other than the one restaurant), and offered no benefit over a quick surreptitious conversation with a bartender or other staff.&nbsp;Even if the code was in use&nbsp;at every bar in the United States, uneasy patrons were still better off&nbsp;directly asking a bartender or bouncer for the help promised by an "angel shot" rather than wasting time with a unique code used by one restaurant and widely shared on social media (to putative victims and "bad Tinder dates" alike). Finally, it was far better to emphasize that there was no shame in directly leaving an uncomfortable scenario, and no reason why a woman should value being polite over trusting an instinctual impulse to exit as soon as possible (no pretense required).&nbsp;
