   Sources close to the situation say that the NY Giants defensive star who had his left hand mauled in a fireworks accident on July 4th 2015, say his Galaxy Note 7 exploded on Thursday night to live stream the Thursday Night Football game.

   “It is believed Mr. Pierre-Paul had the device in his right hand (obviously) while streaming the Chargers vs Broncos game with the Galaxy Note he purchased two weeks ago,” EMT first responder Thisis Satire told reporters. “His first mistake? Watching that boring ass game. Anyways, according to him the phone self ignited and shortly after exploded while still in his hand.”
