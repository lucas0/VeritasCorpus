  Princess is one of the most hotly debated Beanies that Ty has ever produced. This all stems from some enterprising individuals who attempted to change the facts to suit their needs. Many other sellers over the years have unknowingly followed suit.

  No Princess is worth millions of dollars, not even thousands. The Princess Beanie Baby rumor mill has been running rampant for years. It continues to this day due to unethical sellers who set up auctions and have fake buyers seemingly purchase the beanie. This fuels the followers who then list their Princess at insane prices. It has really picked up steam in the past few years.
