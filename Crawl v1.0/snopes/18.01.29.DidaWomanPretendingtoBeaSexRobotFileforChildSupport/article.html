  On 24 January 2018, the web site 8Shit published an
  <a href="http://archive.is/IPAC6" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  positing that a woman posing as a “sex robot” had become pregnant and subsequently filed a child support claim against the unsuspecting customer who didn’t realize she was a real woman:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Stephanie Smith, a 23-year old woman who works as a sex-worker decided to take her job to a whole new level: Becoming a sex robot, being sold and seeing how it plays out. She did it back in December, because she wanted to try it in a month where people “buy a lot of stuff”.
  </p>
  <p>
   The woman got pregnant, and she wants to have the kid. But she doesn’t have enough money or resources to raise the child, so she is filing for child support.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the other hand, the father of the child claims that “He didn’t know it was a real woman” and that he “avoids having sex with real women for this exact reason”.

  None of this bizarre and far-fetched reporting was true.  This story originated with, and was reported solely by,
