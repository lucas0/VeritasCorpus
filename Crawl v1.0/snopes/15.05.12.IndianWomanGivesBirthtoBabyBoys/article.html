  Wikipedia’s list of

   multiple births
  </a>
  records only two instances of nonuplets (nine children born at once to the same mother), none of whom survived more than a few days, so the news of a woman’s giving birth to eleven healthy children at once (all of them boys) would be remarkable indeed.

  The article referenced above, which claims an Indian woman delivered eleven living children at the same time, is not such news, however. It’s a fabrication that was reported nowhere other than on a Zambian “news and entertainment”

  , the couples involved had all conceived via in vitro fertilization with an eye towards giving birth on that particular date:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A city-based In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) centre will undertake operations on 11 would-be mothers to schedule the births of their babies on Friday, 11-11-11.
  </p>
  <p>
   About 30 women had conceived through IVF nine months ago at the 21st Century Hospital in the city. Of them, 11 couples wanted the delivery of their babies on the special date.
  </p>
  <p>
   The operations will be performed by Dr Purnima Nadkarni and Dr Pooja Nadkarni and their team of doctors at the hospital from 6 am. All the 11 women who conceived through IVF have waited a long time for this moment.

  A later version of this item included a purported photograph of the Indian woman who birthed the eleven baby boys:
