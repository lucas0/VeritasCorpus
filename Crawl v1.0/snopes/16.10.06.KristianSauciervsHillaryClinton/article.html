  A 4 October 2016 debate between vice presidential candidates Mike Pence and Tim Kaine led to renewed interest in the August 2016 conviction of Navy sailor Kristian Saucier on charges he mishandled classified information:

  During the debate, Pence and Kaine sparred over whether Kaine’s running mate, Hillary Clinton, received favorable treatment in comparison to service members prosecuted for similar accusations. The relevant exchange was widely reproduced in coverage of the debate and occurred when moderator Elaine Quijano posed a question about Syria, and Pence interjected to ask if he could discuss cybersecurity. That digression quickly turned to mention of Clinton’s e-mail server controversy, and launched a

   dispute

  over whether it was true American service members had been prosecuted for similar actions:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   PENCE: First, Donald Trump just spoke about this issue this week. We have got to bring together the best resources of this country to understand that cyber warfare is the new warfare of the asymmetrical enemies that we face in this country. And I look forward if I’m privileged to be in this role of working with you in the Senate to make sure that we resource that effort.
  </p>
  <p>
   KAINE: We will work together in whatever roles we inhabit.
  </p>
  <p>
   PENCE: We have an intelligence, sir (ph). But I will also tell you that it’s important in this moment to remember that Hillary Clinton had a private server in her home that had classified information on it [moderator interjects] about drone strikes, e-mails from the president of the United States of America were on there.
  </p>
  <p>
   QUIJANO: Right.
  </p>
  <p>
   PENCE: Her private server was subject to being hacked by foreign …
  </p>
  <p>
   [CROSSTALK]
  </p>
  <p>
   QUIJANO: I’d like to ask you about Syria, Governor.
  </p>
  <p>
   PENCE: We could put cybersecurity first if we just make sure the next secretary of state doesn’t have a private server.
  </p>
  <p>
   [CROSSTALK]
  </p>
  <p>
   KAINE: And all investigation concluded that not one reasonable prosecutor would take any additional step. You don’t get to decide the rights and wrongs of this. We have a justice system that does that. And a Republican FBI director did an investigation and concluded that …
  </p>
  <p>
   [CROSSTALK, MODERATOR INTERJECTS]
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    PENCE: If your son or my son handled classified information the way Hillary Clinton did
   </strong>
   [moderator interjects] one hundred thousand of them children — Governor …
  </p>
  <p>
   PENCE: …
   <strong>
    they’d be court martialed.
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    KAINE: That is absolutely false and you know that.
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   PENCE: Absolutely true.
  </p>
  <p>
   KAINE: And you know that, Governor.
  </p>
  <p>
   QUIJANO: Governor …
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    PENCE: It’s absolutely true.
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   QUIJANO: Gentlemen, please.

  Among the individuals citing Saucier’s conviction in response to the dispute was Kathleen Saucier, the serviceman’s mother. Saucier published a Facebook

  to a conservative blog’s page objecting to Kaine’s denial that Hillary Clinton’s handling of classified e-mail would have resulted in a court martial if she were a member of the military:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Please explain Kaine’s responses … my son is Kristian Saucier the navy sailor going to prison for mishandling classified information — taking 6 photos in a classified area of a submarine — there is no evidence he ever transmitted or shared any of these photos:
