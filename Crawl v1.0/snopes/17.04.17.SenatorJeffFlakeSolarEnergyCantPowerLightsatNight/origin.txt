<blockquote>
 <p>
  Sen. Jeff Flake encountered a raucous audience at a town hall meeting in Mesa, Arizona.
 </p>
 <p>
  Constituents peppered the Republican lawmaker with questions about President Donald Trump’s actions in office, and his broader agenda on climate change, the president’s taxes, the Supreme Court and Planned Parenthood.
 </p>
 <p>
  Much like other GOP town halls held since Trump assumed the Oval Office, attendees railed against Flake, many of whom accused him of being a rubber stamp for Trump. Flake, like Reps. Jason Chaffetz, Mike Coffman, and Sen. Mitch McConnell before him, attempted to answer the audience’s concerns, though most explanations drew shouts and boos from the crowd.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Flake’s town hall did not appear to have a large presence of demonstrators as those of some high-profile congress members in recent months, Flake at times struggled to contend with fits of chanting and jeering from the crowd at the Mesa Convention Center.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not all of the questions were hostile, and some constituents applauded Flake for sharing his time. The senator extended the meeting by one hour to take more questions, but the mood frequently returned to a bitter note. “Can you just remind me when you’re up for reelection,” one woman asked. The audience erupted in cheers at the question.
