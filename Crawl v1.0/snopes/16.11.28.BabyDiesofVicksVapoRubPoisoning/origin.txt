  A Mexican mother tells her tragedy to warn other parents and avoid someone else going through what she’s living: the loss of her 2-years-old baby.
 </p>
 <p>
  When she came back from work, she came into her baby’s room. When she got near to kiss him, she felt he had a fever. She imagined it was just a common cold and thought about a home remedy to relieve him.
 </p>
 <p>
  She rubbed Vick VapoRub on his chest, back, and under his nose to help him breathe. She tucked him up and laid down next to him.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was tired, so she fell asleep next to her baby. Hours later, when she woke up, she noticed her son wasn’t breathing.
 </p>
 <p>
  She carried him and took it to the hospital to save him. But, sadly, everything was pointless, the baby had been dead for hours.
 </p>
 <p>
  The medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory tract, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment.
