<blockquote>
 <p>
  When your birth certificate was monetized and converted into a UNITED STATES Government Bond shortly after your birth by your Mother, your net worth became unlimited, into Billions of Dollars, without your, nor your Mother’s, and Father’s, knowledge.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the UNITED STATES declared bankruptcy in 1933 under the bankruptcy (Straw man) law known as HJR 192, pledged all Americans as collateral (debt slaves) against the national debt to the International Bankers; gave all the land to the international bankers (Federal Reserve Corporation); and confiscated and outlawed all the gold except for one ounce for each person; thus, eliminating the lawful means (Gold and Silver Coins) by which you could legally pay your debt, the UNITED STATES also assumed legal responsibility for providing a new way for you to pay.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 1933, the UNITED STATES Government declared that they would pay all of YOUR debts with the money they receive from your labor, birth certificate, and Social Security registered number by what is known as your Reserve Account worth Billions!
 </p>
 <p>
  The UNITED STATES Corporation Government did that by providing what is known as the Exemption Account.
 </p>
 <p>
  The bankers loan credit and not money, because there has not been any lawful money since 5 June 1933.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Exemption Account is your exemption from having to pay for anything.
 </p>
 <p>
  In practical terms, though, this meant giving each American something to pay with, and that something is your credit.
 </p>
 <p>
  This secret has been hidden for over 79 years.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your value to society was then and is still calculated using actuarial tables.
 </p>
 <p>
  At birth, average value bonds were created from your birth certificate.
 </p>
 <p>
  I understand that this is currently between one and two million dollars at your birth when your mother unknowingly gave her baby, you, away to the UNITED STATES Government.
 </p>
 <p>
  These birth certificate bonds were collateralized by your birth certificate and your mother’s maiden name under an Act of Congress in 1921.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then your birth certificate bond became a negotiable instrument just like any security instrument under UCC Article 3, code of commercial law in which the world trade falls under.
 </p>
 <p>
  The bonds are hypothecated and traded on the stock market until their value is unlimited for all intents and purposes.
 </p>
 <p>
  People all over the world buy and sell your bond every day over the stock markets as investments.
 </p>
 <p>
  All that credit created is technically, and rightfully, yours.
 </p>
 <p>
  In point of fact, you should be able to go into any store in America and buy anything and everything in sight, telling the clerk to charge it to your Exemption Account, which is identified by a nine-digit number that you will recognize as your Social Security number, without the dashes.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is your EIN, which stands for Exemption Identification Number from the UNITED STATES CORPORATION of America.”
