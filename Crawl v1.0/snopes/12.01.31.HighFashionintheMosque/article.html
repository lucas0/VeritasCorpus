  This photograph of a man wearing what appears to be a 9/11-themed shirt has been circulating online for many years since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, alongside claims that it depicts a mass-produced item commonly worn by residents of Middle Eastern countries — demonstrating that those who live in that part of the world disdain America and/or approved of the attacks.

  However, contextual items within the photograph indicate it was taken in India rather than the Middle East, and the garment appears to be a locally made item fashioned by a small-scale manufacturer rather than a mass-produced one. Moreover, some (or most) of the shirt’s buyers may be attracted by its colorful and vibrant design and not necessarily recognize its import — plenty of people throughout the world purchase and display items bearing the likenesses of such notorious figures as Adolf Hitler, Che Guevara, and Josef Stalin without being aware of who those people are or what they did that made them (in)famous.
