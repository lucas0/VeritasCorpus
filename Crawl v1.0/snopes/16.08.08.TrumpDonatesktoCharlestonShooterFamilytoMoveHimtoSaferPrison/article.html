  On 5 August 2016, the
  <em>
   TMZHipHop
  </em>
  web site published an
  <a href="http://archive.is/d6gep" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  reporting that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump had privately donated $50,000 to secure the transfer of Charleston church shooting suspect Dylann Roof to a safer facility after the latter was beaten by a fellow inmate:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “DYLANN DOESN’T DESERVE TO BE BEATEN. NOBODY DESERVES TO BE BEATEN. NOT EVEN A MEXICAN.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Tweeted Trump after donating $50,000 to Dylann Roof’s family.

   Donald Trump donated $50,000 to Dylann Roof’s family after he was attacked by an inmate so that he could afford to move to a safer prison while he awaits his trial.
  </p>
  <p>
   “HE COULD’VE EASILY TRIPPED AND FELL ON THAT TRIGGER AND LET OFF 50 ROUNDS BY ACCIDENT. IT CAN HAPPEN.” – TRUMP
  </p>
  <p>
   Trump says don’t worry he made that $50,000 back within the next hour due to his multiple investments in foreign hair pieces.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The article was outwardly satirical in tone, quoting Trump as lamenting “even a Mexican” didn’t deserve to be beaten in jail, that Roof “could’ve easily tripped and [fallen]” on the trigger of the gun that killed nine churchgoers, and that the mogul “made that $50,000 back” in an hour due to “investments in foreign hairpieces.”
