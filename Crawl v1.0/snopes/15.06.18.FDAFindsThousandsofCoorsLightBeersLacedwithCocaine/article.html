  In early September 2014, the Huzlers web site published an
  <a href="http://www.donotlink.com/fl1g" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  positing that the FDA had halted production of Coors Light brand beer because they found it to be contaminated with cocaine:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   It has been reported by the FDA that cocaine has been found in Thousands of Coors Light beers nationwide. The FDA began investigating beers before they were sent out from the factories, as well as beers that were already on shelves ready for sale in thousands of businesses across the U.S.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  Shortly thereafter links and excerpts referencing this article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered the item mistaking it for a genuine news report. However, that article was just a spoof from Huzlers, a web site that offers users the ability to “Create your own news prank and trick your friends by sharing it” and has a history of publishing fabricated news stories (such as one about pop star

  being rigged). The Huzlers site also carries a disclaimer on its pages noting that “Huzlers.com is a combination of real shocking news and satire news to keep its visitors in a state of disbelief.”
