  FRIGHTENING SITUATION – OBAMA IS CHANGING THE FACE OF THE USA
 </p>
 <p>
  PLEASE SEND THIS TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW ON EVERY WEB SITE YOU ALSO CHAT IN. THIS IS NOT A JOKE – IT IS HAPPENING!!!
 </p>
 <p>
  This is an accurate picture of every Friday afternoon in several locations throughout NYC where there are mosques with a large
  <br>
   number of Muslims that cannot fit into the mosque – They fill the surrounding streets, facing east for a couple of hours between
   <br/>
   about 2 &amp; 4 p.m. – Besides this one at 42nd St &amp; Madison Ave, there is another, even larger group, at 94th St &amp; 3rd Ave, etc., etc. – Also, I presume, you are aware of the dispute over building another “high rise” Mosque a few blocks from “ground zero” – With regard to that one, the “Imam” refuses to disclose where the $110 million dollars to build it is coming from and there is a lawsuit filed to force disclosure of that information – November can’t come soon enough
  </br>
 </p>
 <p>
  This is in New York City on Madison Avenue, not in France or the Middle East or Yemen or Kenya.

 <p>
  Is there a message here???? Yes, there is, and they are claiming America for Allah. If we don’t wake up soon, we are going to “politically correct” ourselves right out of our own country!
 </p>
 <p>
  A Christian Nation cannot put up a Christmas scene of the baby Jesus in a public place, but the Muslims can stop normal traffic every Friday afternoon by worshiping in the streets…. Something is happening in America that is reminiscent of what is happening in Europe. This is Political Correctness gone crazy…
