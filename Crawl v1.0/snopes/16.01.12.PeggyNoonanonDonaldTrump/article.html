  In January 2016, the above-reproduced missive began appearing in our inbox; according to the e-mail, its content was written by Peggy Noonan and published “this weekend” in the
  <em>
   Wall Street Journal
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The descriptor of “this weekend” was a hallmark of specious e-mail attributions, as it provided no specifics, but enabled it to circulate in perpetuity as “recent.” A portion at the end beseeched readers “[not to] criticize someone because the media does,” a turn of phrase entirely out of place in a
  <em>
   Wall Street Journal
  </em>
  column.
 </p>
 <p>
  Further, its content wasn’t novel (nor newly published) in January 2016. Nearly identical versions of the text circulated as early as

  without attribution. Concurrently, it appeared in the comments section of a
  <em>
   Washington Times
  </em>
  <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/8/bill-maher-trump-could-go-all-the-way/" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  dated 8 August 2015 (one day after its above-linked Reddit appearance.)

  Predictably, we were unable to locate any material attributed to Peggy Noonan that matched the Trump e-mail forward. The content circulated in blog comments and on social media for several months before Noonan’s name was attached to it, and the added (but spurious) credibility of a well-known media personality and popular newspaper injected new life into the commentary. While readers might find the perspective agreeable, it didn’t originate with Peggy Noonan.
