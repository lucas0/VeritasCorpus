  , Silicon Valley is going all-in on “off-the-grid” water — marketed as an untainted, healthier alternative to bottled or tap water. There’s a growing movement to drink what some people are calling “raw water,” and some companies are capitalizing by selling untreated spring water at a considerable markup at health food stores on the West Coast.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Raw water proponents either buy this water or find their own natural spring water for drinking. The health risks inherent to either form of untreated water — cholera, E. coli, hepatitis, and giardia, just to name a few — have been

  . Without sterilization procedures, there is no guarantee the water does not contain pathogens, either from the water source or introduced during the collection and bottling process.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  But what about the argument that, despite these health risks, there is some inherent benefit to drinking unpurified water? When intelligible, the rationalizations boil down (not literally, of course) to a collection of health aphorisms with no demonstrable relationship to untreated spring water. As a case study, we will focus on the raw water purveyor

    primary benefit

  imparted by his water, which he told the
  <i>
   Times
  </i>
  “stays most fresh within one lunar cycle of delivery,” is beneficial bacteria that would have otherwise been removed during the sterilization process. His company’s web site reads:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   Living spring water is the key to unlocking a perfect micro-biome balance. The probiotics listed [in this analysis of our water] are exclusive to our unsterilized water. […] They are imperative for optimal physical and mental health. Without these probiotics we’re not able to fully assimilate all the nutrients in our food. Some beneficial bacteria are also ​proven​ to have abilities to transform harmful bacteria. Here is a published medical report supporting evidence that raw spring water has vast healing abilities.

   Pseudomonas oleovorans

  , the most common bacterial strain in Live Water, is known primarily for its ability to degrade the triarylmethane dye

  role for some

  infectious bacteria, its inclusion on the Live Water website is an absolute non-sequitur because Singh provides no evidence that any bacteriophage is in his product.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bottom line: It’s not 100% clear what Singh is talking about here, but he appears to have confused bacteria with bacteriophage — an unforced error, given the wholescale irrelevance of phage therapy to his raw spring water.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">

   “A Published Medical Report Proving Raw Spring Water Has Vast Healing Abilities”
  </b>
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Finally, Singh links to a single scientific study as evidence to support his claim that raw water has “vast healing abilities.” The
  <span class="s1">

    study
   </span>
  </a>
  speculated that a single mineral spring’s ability to heal
  <i>
   skin wounds
  </i>
  (topically, not by drinking it) might
  <i>
   possibly
  </i>
  be aided by the bacteria present. (None of the bacteria in that spring was identified in Live Water).
 </p>
 <p>
  In other words, the one (preliminary) scientific study Singh actually cites is about the healing properties of soaking in a specific spring in Italy, not about drinking spring water. It is, like many other statements made on Live Water’s website, irrelevant to the issue at hand.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Ultimately, the probiotic claims of Live Water (and those made by other similar companies) are based on wholesale misreadings of scientific papers and principles that, even if interpreted correctly, would offer no relevance to — let alone proof of — raw water’s probiotic potential.
