  <!-- ORIGINAL TITLE: "Come On, Get Fappy"-->
  On 13 November 2015, the web site
  <em>
   NewsExaminer
  </em>
  published an article reporting that the “Fappy the Anti-Masturbation Dolphin,” a mascot for the “Stop Masturbation Now” Christian group, had been arrested for swimming naked with dolphins at the SeaWorld marine park in San Diego, California:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In an ironic twist of a fate, a mascot for a Christian anti-masturbation group was arrested today for masturbating in public. The mascot, along with his organization, Stop Masturbation Now, recently finished a federally funded 31-city nationwide school tour which they claim focused on educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, whose real name is 37-year-old Paul Horner, was arrested at Sea World after employees notified police about a man swimming in the dolphin tank with nothing on except a dolphin mascot head.

 </blockquote>

  While the above-quoted article was published in November 2015, this was not the first appearance of Fappy the Anti-Masturbation Dolphin (a non-existent mascot representing a non-existent group).  The fake mascot of the fictional organization Stop Masturbation Now is a mainstay of the fake news site
  <em>
   NewsExaminer
  </em>
  (and their shill site, CBSnews.com.co) and has not only appeared in a number of their fabricated articles, but even has his own

  page and was the subject of a fake press release fake touting an upcoming Michael Moore

   documentary
  </a>
  in 2013.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite Fappy’s frequent appearances on the Internet, the mascot is a fictional character created as part of an elaborate and ongoing hoax.
