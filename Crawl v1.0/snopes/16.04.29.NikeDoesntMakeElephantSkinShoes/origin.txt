  Several years ago, Nike learned of an elephant that had one leg shorter than the others. To help the elephant find its balance, Nike manufactured this massive leather shoe, complete with laces and buckles at the heel. The elephant was fitted for the shoe using lifts. Pink remnants on the sides are whatâ€™s left from the Swoosh logos that used to adorn the sides.
