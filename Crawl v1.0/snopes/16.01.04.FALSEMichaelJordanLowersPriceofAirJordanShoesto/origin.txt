  Michael Jordan claims he is shocked and tired of people fighting and killing over his high priced shoes. He wants to set a point, by indicating individuals that spending more cash on something elite doesn’t make you exceptional it just makes you a fool with money. He plans to lower the prices nationwide slowly over the next years to deter any backlash, specially in the black community.

  “I’m just tired of people paying for the illusion that more expensive means better, when in reality my shoes cost way less to make,” said Michael Jordan, on why he is lowering the price of Air Jordan brand sneakers.
