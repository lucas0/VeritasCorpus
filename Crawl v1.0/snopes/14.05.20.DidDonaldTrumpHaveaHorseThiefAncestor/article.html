  What are the odds that two prominent Democrats would both have distant relatives with funny names who were hanged for train robbery and horse stealing?
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Hillary, an amateur genealogical researcher, discovered that her great-great uncle, Remus Rodham, a fellow lacking in character, was hanged for horse stealing and train robbery in Montana in 1889. The only known photograph of Remus shows him standing on the gallows.

   On the back of the picture is this inscription:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Remus Rodham; horse thief, sent to Montana Territorial Prison 1885, escaped 1887, robbed the Montana Flyer six times. Caught by Pinkerton detectives, convicted and hanged in 1889.”
  </p>
  <p>
   In Hillary’s Family History, her staff of professional image consultants cropped Remus’s picture, scanned it, enlarged the image, and edited it with image processing software so that all that’s seen is a head shot.
  </p>
  <p>
   The accompanying biographical sketch is as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Remus Rodham was a famous cowboy in the Montana Territory. His business empire grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets and intimate dealings with the Montana railroad. Beginning in 1883, he devoted several years of his life to service at a government facility, finally taking leave to resume his dealings with the railroad. In 1887, he was a key player in a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective Agency. In 1889, Remus passed away during an important civic function held in his honor when the platform upon which he was standing collapsed.”

  Not as long as you might think, apparently, because the same day in 2000 we received the example quoted above, we also received the following version:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Tipper Gore, an amateur genealogical researcher, discovered that her husband’s great-great uncle, Gunther Gore, a fellow lacking in character, was hanged for horse stealing and train robbery in Tennessee in 1889. The only known photograph of Gunther shows him standing on the gallows. On the back of the picture is this inscription:”Gunther Gore; horse thief, sent to Tennessee Prison 1885, escaped 1887, robbed the Tennessee Flyer six times. Caught by Pinkerton detectives, convicted and hanged in 1889.”
  </p>
  <p>
   After letting Al Gore and his staff of professional image consultants peruse the findings, they decided to crop Gunther’s picture, scan it in as an enlarged image, and edited it with image processing software so that all that’s seen is a head shot.
  </p>
  <p>
   The accompanying biographical sketch was sent to the Associated Press as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Gunther Gore was a famous rancher in early Tennessee history. His business empire grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets and intimate dealings with the Tennessee railroad. Beginning in 1883, he devoted several years of his life to service at a government facility, finally taking leave to resume his dealings with the railroad. In 1887, he was a key player in a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective Agency.

   A LITTLE KNOWN FACT OF TEXAS HISTORY
  </p>
  <p>
   Not very many of you folks out there know all about Texas history. Here’s some of the more “colorful” moments in the archives of this great state, and some of her true characters.Laura Bush, an amateur genealogical researcher, discovered that her husband’s great-great uncle, Chadsworth Bush, a fellow lacking in character, was hanged for horse stealing and train robbery in Texas in 1889.
  </p>
  <p>
   The only known photograph of Chadsworth Bush shows him standing on the gallows. On the back of the picture is this inscription: “Chadsworth Bush; horse thief, sent to Texas Prison 1885, escaped 1887, robbed the Texas Flyer six times. Caught by Pinkerton detectives, convicted and hanged in 1889.”
  </p>
  <p>
   After letting George W Bush and his staff of professional image onsultants peruse the findings, they decided to crop Chadsworth’s picture, scan it in as an enlarged image, and edit it with image processing software so that the biographical sketch was sent to the Associated Press as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Chadsworth Bush was a famous rancher in early Texas history. His business empire grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets and intimate dealings with the Texas railroad.. Beginning in 1883, he devoted several years to service at a government facility, finally taking leave to resume his dealings with the railroad.
  </p>

   “In 1887, he was a key player in a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective Agency. In 1889, Chadsworth Bush passed away during an important civic function held in his honor when the platform upon which he was standing collapsed.”
  </p>
  <p>
   And thus passed the very first “hanging Chad.”

  In December 2008 a version aimed at a Canadian politician appeared online:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Judy Wallman, a professional genealogical researcher, discovered that Robert Dion, the great-great uncle of Stephane Dion, the leader of Canada’s Liberal Party, was hanged for horse stealing and train robbery in Quebec in 1889. The only known photograph of Dion shows him standing on the gallows. On the back of the picture is this inscription:”Robert Dion; horse thief, sent to Quebec Provincial Prison 1883, escaped 1887, robbed the Canadian Pacific Railway six times. Caught by Pinkerton detectives, convicted, and hanged in 1889.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Judy e-mailed Stephane Dion for comments. Dion’s staff sent back the following biographical sketch:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Robert Dion was a famous horseman in Quebec. His business empire grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets and intimate dealings with the Canadian Pacific Railroad. Beginning in 1883, he devoted several years of his life to service at a government facility, finally taking leave in 1887 to resume his dealings with the railroad. Subsequently, he was a key player in a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective Agency. In 1889, Dion passed away during an important civic function held in his honour, when the platform on which he was standing collapsed.”

  Shortly after Republican senator Ted Stevens of Alaska was convicted in October 2008 on seven felony counts of violating federal ethics laws, this joke was updated again in versions that featured both his name and that of Democratic Senate majority leader Harry Reid:
 </p>
 <blockquote>

   Jane Stevens, a professional genealogy researcher here in Alaska, was doing some personal work on her own family tree. She discovered that Ted Stevens’ great-great uncle, Remus Stevens, was hanged for horse stealing and train robbery in Montana in 1889.

  In 2009 this joke was circulated in a version that featured Vice President Joe Biden doing his own genealogical research:
 </p>
 <blockquote>

  The jape was still going strong in 2017, with a versiopn circulating on Facebook iteration about President Donald Trump:
