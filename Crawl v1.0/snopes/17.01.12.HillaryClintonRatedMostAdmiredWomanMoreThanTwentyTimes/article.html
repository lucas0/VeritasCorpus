  On 30 December 2016, Daily.Headlines.com published a
  <a href="http://dailyheadlines.com/hillary-clinton-most-admired-woman/" target="_blank">
   story
  </a>
  reporting that former Secretary of State and presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton had been rated the “most admired woman” in the United States for the 21st time:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been declared the Most Admired Woman of 2016. Who the hell are they surveying is what I want to know!
  </p>
  <p>
   According to a newly released Gallup survey, Clinton has topped the list of America’s most admired woman for the 15th year in a row, and the 21st time ever.

 <p>
  While this particular claim is
  <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/1678/most-admired-man-woman.aspx" target="_blank">
   true
  </a>
  , DailyHeadlines.com is unreliable; it often publishes stories that typically combine factual and erroneous information.
 </p>
 <p>
  (For example, on 11 January 2017, the site posted a
  <a href="http://dailyheadlines.com/cnn-does-the-unthinkable/" target="_blank">
   story
  </a>
  which claimed that CNN had published a two-page memo presented to President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump about alleged sensitive information in Russian possession that could compromise Trump. CNN, in fact, did not publish this document.)
 </p>
 <p>
  According to
  <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/1678/most-admired-man-woman.aspx" target="_blank">
   Gallup
  </a>
  , Clinton topped the list in 2016 at 12 percent, with First Lady Michelle Obama taking second place at 8 percent. Obama got the number one spot for “most admired man,” with Trump coming in second.
