The woman is so odd, so starved for validation, so tormented and vain it is a constant surprise to me anyone takes her seriously. Everyone on the team knows how unwell she is but they’re more determined than ever to see her win. This woman has a dozen seizures a day. This godless shrieking malcontent passed out in her medical van. This walking cadaver. She’s nonfunctional, Hassan, nobody cares. We sober her up for speeches and indulge the press corps with cheap sentiment. The first female president. The last glass ceiling, etc. They trip over themselves lining up behind her. Surely they know it’s not Her they’re getting, it’s the one in the corner, the quiet helper, your sister Huma. You asked me once how I did it. How did I take the castle? Hassan, I didn’t take it, they gave it to me. Yes, there was a cost, I will admit, subjecting myself to men like AW and WJC is mortal torture. But I do it gladly, brother, everything they ask of me, however sick and depraved, I do it and I smile, rejoicing at the thought of whose glory I serve. &gt;&gt;
