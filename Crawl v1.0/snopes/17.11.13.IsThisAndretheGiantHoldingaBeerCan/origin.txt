  That’s no small beer on the right, it’s a normal 12-ounce can in the hand of 7’4″, 500-pound wrestler Andre the Giant. The glass is in the prodigious paw of the author, a former superweight powerlifting champion, who describes what life is like for a man who has made the most of being the biggest.
