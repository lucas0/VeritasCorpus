  Good morning. It’s my honor and privilege to be here today as President-elect Trump’s request. He has asked me, as you just heard, to speak about the conflicts of interest and the steps he’s taking — as you know, the business empire built by President-elect Trump over the years is massive. Not dissimilar to this fortune of Nelson Rockefeller when he became vice president. But at that time, no one was so concerned. President-elect Trump wants the American public to rest assured that all of his efforts are directed to pursuing the people’s business and not his own.
 </p>
 <p>
  To that end, as he explained a few moments ago, he directed me and my colleagues at the law firm Morgan Lewis &amp; Bockius to design a structure for his business empire that would completely isolate him from the management of the company. He further instructed that we build in protections that will assure the American people the decisions he makes and the actions he takes as president are for their benefit and not to support his financial interests.
