  On 8 October 2016, an article on the web site Da1lymail.com reported that Jamaican Olympic sprinter Usain Bolt donated $10 million to the nation of Haiti in the wake of devastation caused by Hurricane Matthew earlier that week:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Jamaican Sprinter Usain Bolt has donated 10 million dollars to help rebuild Haiti, after the island nation wasslammed [sic] by Hurricane Matthew this week.
  </p>
  <p>
   The donation which will be utilized through his foundation was announced today after he travelled to Haiti to ascertain the damage caused by the hurricane.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The information, replicated on other sites such as 3jamaica.com, us.blastingnews.com, and voice-online.co.uk, was incorrect, however. Like a previous

   instance
  </a>
  of false reporting on Bolt’s charitable activities, the story was a hoax created to amass web traffic and ad revenues.
 </p>
 <p>
  The web site’s URL — Da1lyMail.com — mimics that of an actual online news site (DailyMail.com), but with the numeral “1” substituted for the first “i” in the domain name. Da1lyMail.com has a reputation for publishing trashy satirical news stories, including an article defaming Usain Bolt, “

  .”
 </p>
 <p>
  On the same day, other fake news web sites published similar articles stating that pop singer Shakira donated $15 million to help Haiti:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Colombian singer and dancer Shakira has made a donation of 15 million dollars towards the rebuilding of Haiti which suffered the wrath of Hurricane Matthew this week.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jamaican Sprinter Usain Bolt is also reported to have donated.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shakira’s donation was made through his [sic] newly launched Shakira Foundation and it would oversee the rebuilding of the island.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  While Shakira has visited Haiti in the past and contributed to its rebuilding after the 2010 earthquake, the more recent stories about her donating millions to Haitian hurricane relief — like those about Usain Bolt — are pure fiction.
