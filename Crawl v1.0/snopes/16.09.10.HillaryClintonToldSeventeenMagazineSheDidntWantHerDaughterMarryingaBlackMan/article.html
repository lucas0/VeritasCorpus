  In September 2016, as election-related misinformation reached a fever pitch, a graphic appeared featuring a photograph of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton alongside a quote — purportedly from a 1995 interview with
  <em>
   Seventeen
  </em>
  magazine —
  <i>
  </i>
  that she would be disappointed if her daughter Chelsea married a black man:

  <p>
   Would I be extremely disappointed if she (Chelsea) chose to marry a black man? Yes. Would I stop loving her? No, absolutely not.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  However, we found no evidence of Clinton making this remark, or even giving an
  <a href="http://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/g1713/65th-anniversary-cover-archive/" target="_blank">
   interview
  </a>
  to
  <em>
   Seventeen
  </em>
  at all
  <em>
  </em>
  in 1995. Clinton was First Lady at the time, and if she had made such a remark it would have been covered by various media outlets. It would also have been out of character at the time for
  <em>
   Seventeen
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
  </em>
  a publication largely devoted to celebrities, fashion, and dating, to publish an interview with the First Lady.
 </p>
 <p>
  A spokesperson for
  <em>
   Seventeen
  </em>
  confirmed to us in an email that no such interview occurred:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I couldn’t find anything on Hilary Clinton from the 1995
   <i>
    Seventeen
   </i>
   editions. I looked through each individual magazine and saw nothing!
  </p>

  Hoax quotes are commonplace on the Internet, and

   many
  </a>
  are
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-stupid-quote/" target="_blank">
   circulated
  </a>
  with phony citations and photographs in an attempt to make them appear credible — particularly during an election year.
