  Said Timberlands new appointment in a shocking reveal during a press conference.

  Timberlands former Ceo declined to comment stating that he doesnt want to say if he disagrees nor agrees with the new Ceos statement. Rappers such as Notorious B.I.G. mention the Timberland brand in many of his hit songs and black people are already thinking hes probably rolling in his grave after hearing that black people are actually wearing boots in the summer time.
