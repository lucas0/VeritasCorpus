  The e-mail reproduced in the Example block above claims that a reference to Christ was edited out of the interview by NBC in repeat airings and in the online clip of the interview made available by MSNBC via the MSN web site because “using the word Christ might offend someone.” However, a viewing of the
  <a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/26184891/vp/44056886#44056886" target="_blank">
   interview
  </a>
  as offered on MSN shows no signs of editing and includes religious references from all three participants, including Kimberly Vaughn’s mention of her husband’s “love for Christ.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Billy Vaughn is shown noting that his son “loved his country [and] he loved God,” Karen Vaughn states that “More than anything, I’m most proud of the way [Aaron] loved God and how important his faith was to him,” and a tearful Kimberly Vaughn, in response to a question from Matt Lauer about what their children would know of their father’s legacy, says that “They will take away his love for Christ.  They will take away his strength, and his love for this country. And they will know what an amazing man he
  <nobr>
   is …
  </nobr>
  was.”
 </p>
 <p>
  While it’s possible that some particular NBC affiliate or other local station, in its news reporting, may have aired only excerpts of the interview or cut short the ending (thereby eliminating Kimberly Vaughn’s mention of her husband’s love for Christ), the evidence does not support the claim that NBC itself deliberately edited the interview clip to remove a reference to Christ.

  A November 2012 version of this item altered the first line to reference a “Navy SEAL killed along with the US ambassador in Libya.”  However, the Navy SEAL described in the text was killed in Afghanistan in August 2011, more than a year before the September 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi which resulted in the deaths of the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other members of the mission.
