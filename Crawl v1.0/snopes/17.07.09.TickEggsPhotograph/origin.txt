  On our walk today, I noticed a weird clump of black “balls” on the path. I took a picture of it and when I got home, I was able to zoom in on the picture and noticed a couple of little red ticks. I googled ‘tick eggs’ and that’s what the black clump was! Tick eggs! Yuck. If I had known, I would have smashed them. ugh
