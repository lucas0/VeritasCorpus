   Joys of Muslim Women
   <br>
    by Nonie Darwish
   </br>
  </p>
  <p>
   In the Muslim faith a Muslim man can marry a child as young as 1 year old and have sexual intimacy with this child, consummating the marriage by 9.
  </p>
  <p>
   The dowry is given to the family in exchange for the woman (who becomes his slave) and for the purchase of the private parts of the woman, to use her as a toy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even though a woman is abused she can not obtain a divorce.
  </p>
  <p>
   To prove rape, the woman must have (4) male witnesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Often after a woman has been raped, she is returned to her family and the family must return the dowry. The family has the right to execute her (an honor killing) to restore the honor of the family. Husbands can beat their wives ‘at will’ and he does not have to say why he has beaten her.
  </p>
  <p>
   The husband is permitted to have (4 wives) and a temporary wife for an hour (prostitute) at his discretion.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Shariah Muslim law controls the private as well as the public life of the woman.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the West World (America) Muslim men are starting to demand Shariah Law so the wife can not obtain a divorce and he can have full and complete control of her. It is amazing and alarming how many of our sisters and daughters attending American Universities are now marrying Muslim men and submitting themselves and their children unsuspectingly to the Shariah law.
  </p>
  <p>
   By passing this on, enlightened American women may avoid becoming a slave under Shariah Law.
  </p>
  <p>
   Author and lecturer Nonie Darwish says the goal of radical Islamists is to impose Shariah law on the world, ripping Western law and liberty in two.
  </p>
  <p>
   Darwish was born in Cairo and spent her childhood in Egypt and Gaza before emigrating to America in 1978, When she was eight years old, her father died while leading covert attacks on Israel He was a high-ranking Egyptian military officer stationed with his family in Gaza .
  </p>
  <p>
   When he died, he was considered a “shahid,” a martyr for jihad. His posthumous status earned Nonie and her family an elevated position in Muslim society.
  </p>
  <p>
   But Darwish developed a skeptical eye at an early age. She questioned her own Muslim culture and upbringing. She converted to Christianity after hearing a Christian preacher on television.
  </p>
  <p>
   In her latest book, Darwish warns about creeping Sharia law – what it is, what it means, and how it is manifested in Islamic countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   For the West, she says radical Islamists are working to impose Sharia on the world. If that happens, Western civilization will be destroyed.
  </p>
  <p>
   In twenty years there will be enough Muslim voters in the U.S. to elect the President! I think everyone in the U.S. should be required to read this, but with the ACLU, there is no way this will be widely publicized, unless each of us sends it on!

  Critics

   contend

  that the “facts” about Islam listed above are primarily items that have a kernel of truth to them but which have been mixed with “a whole bunch of fear-mongering misinformation” (particularly in presenting customs that are specific to a particular country as representative of Islam in general).
