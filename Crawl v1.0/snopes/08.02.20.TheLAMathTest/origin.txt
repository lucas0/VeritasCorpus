  A Manitoba school district has barred a Grade 8 instructor from classroom teaching for a year after she distributed a math quiz that used pimps and cocaine trafficking to illustrate questions of arithmetic.

  The 10-question quiz asked how much Willie would make for stealing a number of luxury cars, the distance a thief could travel on a stolen skateboard before he gets “whacked,” and how many “tricks” a day three prostitutes must turn to support their pimp Rufus’s cocaine habit.

  The School District of Mystery Lake in Thompson, Man., suspended the veteran Juniper School teacher on June 5, two days after irate parents brought the “joke” test to the district’s attention. This week the district disciplined her further by assigning her to non-classroom teaching until June, 2003. The teacher has not been identified.

  “I don’t know where she got the idea to give this to kids. We were outraged,” one student’s father, who asked not to be identified, told The Winnipeg Sun. The father saw the “Juniper School Math Proficiency Exam” after his young son brought his copy home from school.
