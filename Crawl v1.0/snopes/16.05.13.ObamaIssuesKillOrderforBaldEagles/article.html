  In early May 2016, a number of alarmist blog posts reported that President Obama had issued a “kill order” allowing more than 4,000 bald eagles to be slaughtered each year for the next 30 years. A popular

  was heavy-handed with symbolism, maintaining that President Obama “really hates” bald eagles:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Bald Eagles are one of the most enduring symbols of being American. They are a majestic bird of prey. They were on the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife until 2007, but were just removed by Obama. They have been endangered for decades, but Obama thinks it’s okay to allow their slaughter.
  </p>
  <p>
   *** Wasn’t he satisfied with killing America already?
  </p>
  <p>
   Obama doesn’t have any issues destroying America. Now, he wants to take down our national symbols. He has also approved the handing out of permits to wind farms that have killed off thousands of Bald Eagles. Obama is doing this in the name of “conservation.” He and his liberal friends at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service are giving out 30-year-permits to wind farms like candy. He really hates the Bald Eagle.
  </p>
  <p>
   *** No, really. Wait till you see how the are getting killed by the thousands.

The Obama administration claims that allowing wind energy companies to kill the eagles will somehow “further conservation” of the bald and golden eagle.</blockquote>

 <p>
  The basis of this claim was something rather different than what sites such as
  <em>
   Liberty Writers
  </em>
  were reporting, however. As an ABC News
  <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wind-energy-permits-raise-kill-limit-bald-eagles/story?id=38881089" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  of 4 May 2016 noted, what has been widely described as a “kill order” for bald eagles is actually revisions to existing wind-energy guidelines that, in part, pertain to accidental bald and golden eagle deaths involving wind turbines. According to the revised guidelines, the time permit of limits granted to wind power companies would be extended from five to 30 years (with renewals still required every five years), and the number of eagles that could permissibly (i.e., without financial penalty) be killed or injured each year by wind power companies would be increased. However, wind power companies would be required to take steps to minimize such losses and would have to take additional measures if they exceeded the stated limits or substantially affected bald or gold eagle populations:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed a new plan that would allow energy companies to operate with permits lasting up to 30 years, while also raising the number of bald eagles they can kill or injure per year without incurring hefty penalties to 4,200, which is nearly four times the current limit.
  </p>
  <p>
   A source within the Obama administration said this is the best plan put forward to actually help conservation efforts, maintaining this new proposal is a “strong protection” for bald and golden eagles.
  </p>
  <p>
   Currently, wind power companies can hold permits for five years at a time, which, according to the source, doesn’t give companies good financial footing. By extending the permit to 30 years, it can encourage the development of wind energy, a key source of renewable power that has increased exponentially in recent years. The 30-year permits would still have to be reviewed every five years, and companies would have to submit reports of how many eagles they kill or injure.
  </p>
  <p>
   The proposal will grant access to critical data about eagles, the source said. It will also allow the administration to work with companies in where the companies place their machines — hopefully to help avoid possible eagle populations.
  </p>
  <p>
   “The permitting system gives us access to eagles and eagle mortalities that we wouldn’t otherwise have,” the source said. “It’s a great mechanism for us to work proactively to prevent eagle deaths.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Under the new proposal, companies would pay a $36,000 fee for a permit, which exempts them from the hefty penalties for killing or injuring eagles. Companies would have to commit to take additional measures if they kill or injure more eagles than estimated, or if new information suggests eagle populations are being affected.

Newswire Reuters also <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-eagles-idUSKCN0XW051" target="_blank">covered</a> the claims in May 2016, again pushing the report out to multiple outlets. Notably, near-identical claims were made in December 2013 about bald eagles, new guidelines, and wind energy. An Associated Press editorial published on 6 December 2013 <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-gives-wind-farms-pass-on-killing-eagles/" target="_blank">held</a>:


<blockquote>The Obama administration said Friday it will allow some companies to kill or injure bald and golden eagles for up to 30 years without penalty, an effort to spur development and investment in green energy while balancing its environmental consequences.

The change, requested by the wind energy industry, will provide legal protection for the lifespan of wind farms and other projects for which companies obtain a permit and make efforts to avoid killing the birds.</blockquote>


That information was contemporaneously reported by <a href="http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2013/12/06/obama-administration-about-to-give-kill-as-many-eagles-as-you-want-pass-to-wind-farms-n1758668" target="_blank">other</a> web sites, all consistent with claims made in May 2016 about "new rules."

A March 2016 item published by the conservationist outlet <em>Audubon</em> <a href="https://www.audubon.org/news/will-wind-turbines-ever-be-safe-birdshttps://www.audubon.org/news/will-wind-turbines-ever-be-safe-birds" target="_blank">asserted</a> that wind "turbines kill an estimated 140,000 to 328,000 birds each year in North America," although that number included all species of bird; the outlet cited a 2013 study on bird collision mortality <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320713003522" target="_blank">published</a> in the journal <em>Biological Conservation</em>. Despite reservations about bird deaths, <em>Audubon</em> concluded:


<blockquote>There’s no doubt that turbines—as we know them now—are flawed inventions, and it could be a long, experiment-filled time before we manage to craft the perfect design. But in a warming world, where more and more birds are going to be threatened by climate change, a pragmatic approach to energy creation and safeguarding the planet’s birds might be the one we have to accept.</blockquote>

  The change in regulations doesn’t mean that power companies are suddenly going to be setting their wind turbines to “eagle kill” mode and bagging the limit of 4,200 bald eagles per year, however. A 2013 article published in the peer-reviewed
  <em>
   Journal of Raptor Research
  </em>
  found that “concerns over the effects of [turbine-related deaths] on North America’s Bald Eagles and Golden Eagles exist, but are weakly substantiated due to a lack of published documentation of mortalities.” That study aimed to “summarize documented cases of eagle mortality at wind energy facilities in the contiguous United States” for the 15-year period prior to its publication.
 </p>
 <p>
  Between 1997 and June 2012, researchers identified 85 combined bald eagle and golden eagle fatalities attributed to wind turbines, or roughly 5.6 deaths per year in the entirety of the contiguous United States. Moreover, of those 85 total eagle deaths in a 15-year period, only six were bald eagles. The remaining 79 deceased birds were golden eagles. Those findings were illustrated in a state-by-state table:

A 2014 study on avian fatalities and wind turbines published in the peer-reviewed journal <em>PLOS One</em> examined data from multiple studies to obtain a profile of mortality risk to birds (including bald eagles) posed by wind turbines and noted that wind stood lower than one percent compared to other "human-related sources of bird deaths":


<blockquote>For all wind energy facilities currently in operation, we estimated that about 134,000 to 230,000 small-passerine fatalities from collision with wind turbines occur annually, or 2.10 to 3.35 small birds/MW of installed capacity. When adjusted for species composition, this indicates that about 368,000 fatalities for all bird species are caused annually by collisions with wind turbines. Other human-related sources of bird deaths, (e.g., communication towers, buildings [including windows]), and domestic cats) have been estimated to kill millions to billions of birds each year. Compared to continent-wide population estimates, the cumulative mortality rate per year by species was highest for black-throated blue warbler and tree swallow; 0.043% of the entire population of each species was estimated to annually suffer mortality from collisions with turbines. For the eighteen species with the next highest values, this estimate ranged from 0.008% to 0.038%, much lower than rates attributed to collisions with communication towers (1.2% to 9.0% for top twenty species).</blockquote>

  Additionally, conservationists
  <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/09/15/wind-turbines-kill-fewer-birds-than-cell-towers-cats/15683843/" target="_blank">
   asserted
  </a>
  that the risk posed to eagles by wind turbines was far less than the risk created by the effect of climate change on the birds’ habitats:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Yet many environmentalists say wind power ultimately benefits birds. It is a “a growing solution to some of the more serious threats that birds face, since wind energy emits no greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change,” Terry Root of Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, said in a statement accompanying the study’s release.
  </p>
  <p>
   [In September 2014], a National Audubon Society report said that hundreds of bird species in the U.S. — including the bald eagle and eight state birds, from Idaho to Maryland — are at “serious risk” due to climate change. It said some species are forecast to lose more than 95% of their current ranges.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Our scientists are still reviewing this particular study,” says Audubon spokesman David Ringer. He says his group strongly supports “properly sited wind power as a renewable energy source that helps reduce the threat posed to birds and people by climate change.” He says it has helped develop guidelines for the wind industry to minimize harm to wildlife.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  So revisions to wind power guidelines allow for the possibility that wind power companies could kill more bald and golden eagles without penalty (up to 4,200) than they have in the past. However, there is little evidence that many eagles have been killed or injured under the existing rules, and the revisions are balanced by requirements that wind power companies implement more stringent safeguards to protect such animals, such as enabling the collection of valuable information about eagles, and helping to foster sources of energy (such as wind power) that do not threaten eagles through the degradation of their existing habitats.
