 <p>
  Sources close to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) have confirmed to
  <em>
   The Adobo Chronicles
  </em>
  that the chosen theme for this year’s convention is “Vote Your Conscience.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The theme reinforces the idea that it is “unconscionable” for any American to vote for Donald Trump.
 </p>
 <p>
  And what better person to expound on this theme than former Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Cruz emphasized this theme during his speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland earlier this week
  </em>
  . He has been invited by DNC to speak just before Hillary Clinton delivers her nomination acceptance speech.  He has accepted.
