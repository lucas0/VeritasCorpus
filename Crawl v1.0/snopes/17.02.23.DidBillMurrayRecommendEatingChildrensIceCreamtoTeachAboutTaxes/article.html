  A meme circulating on social media as of late February 2017 attributes a quote about paying taxes to actor Bill Murray, but it was originally shared by a parody Twitter account.
 </p>
 <p>
  The parody quote says, “The best way to teach your kids about taxes is by eating 30% of their ice cream”:

   The account from which it was posted, however, bears this disclaimer:
  </br>
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I AM NOT BILL MURRAY. This is a parody account. This account is not in any way affiliated with the actor Bill Murray.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The account posts mostly benign jokes in the casual tone and pithy humor associated with Murray, such as “Trail mix? Oh, you mean M&amp;M’s with obstacles” and “When one door closes another one opens. Or you could jut re-open the closed door. Because that’s how doors work.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The fact the Twitter account is not real, as usual, did not prevent it from being widely shared. A number of web sites picked it up and reported it as a genuine quote.  For example, in November 2015, the disreputable site PoliticalInsider.com
  <a href="http://thepoliticalinsider.com/bill-murray-describes-taxes-to-children-this-is-gold/" target="_blank">
   shared
  </a>
  it as fact, as did
  <a href="http://archive.is/YMkYE" target="_blank">
   TheFederalistPapers.org.
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  We were unable to find any genuine comments made by the actor Bill Murray about his feelings on taxes. He also does not have an official Twitter account. This is not the first time a fake quote has been attributed to the actor; in 2016, a fake news web site
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/bill-murray-run-president/" target="_blank">
   reported
  </a>
  that Murray was going to run for president (and that he had made disparaging remarks about religion).
