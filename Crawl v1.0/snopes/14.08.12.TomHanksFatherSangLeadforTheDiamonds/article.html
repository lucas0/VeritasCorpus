   The Diamonds
  </a>
  were one of the most popular vocal groups of the 1950s, a quartet of Canadians best known for their hit “Little Darlin’,” which reached the #2 spot on Billboard’s singles chart in 1957. Tom Hanks is an American actor, producer, writer, and director best known for winning consecutive Best Actor Academy Awards (for
  <i>
   Philadelphia
  </i>
  in 1993 and
  <i>
   Forrest Gump
  </i>
  in 1994). Contrary to the rumor reproduced above, however, there is no familial connection between The Diamonds and Tom Hanks.
