  In November 2016, the
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/pizzagate-conspiracy/" target="_blank">
   Pizzagate
  </a>
  conspiracy theory grew to encompass many other claims. One of those was that Tony and John Podesta (the latter Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager, the former his brother) had a detailed connection to the abduction of missing British girl Madeleine McCann:
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Images of 2013 police sketches known as “efits” (short for “Electronic Facial Identification Technique,” or computer-generated composite images) were circulated alongside images of the Podestas with little ancillary information, such as the photograph above, which was
  <a href="http://archive.is/3PWTL" target="_blank">
   published
  </a>
  without any additional context.
 </p>
 <p>
  It appears to show incontrovertibly that the Podesta brothers eerily resemble the men wanted in connection with the kidnapping of Madeleine McCann in Portugal on 3 May 2007.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without the necessary context, the images to seem to resemble the brothers. However, that context is key in this case. The sketch depicts not two but one man, and that man was sought as a witness to the kidnapping (not necessarily a perpetrator of or accessory to it). The digitally generated images were released in October 2013, alongside renewed
  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/14/british-detectives-efits-madeleine-mccann-suspect" target="_blank">
   pleas
  </a>
  from police to the public for any information in the cold McCann case:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Police have issued two efits that they believe are descriptions of the same man, who is now being sought as a priority by the British detectives leading the new McCann inquiry.
  </p>
  <p>
   He was seen in the vicinity of the Praia da Luz resort in Portugal six years ago at the time that the three-year-old went missing. Despite numerous appeals for information over the years, the man has not come forward to talk to investigators in Portugal or Britain.
  </p>
  <p>
   Descriptions of the suspect were given to the Portuguese inquiry by two witnesses after Madeleine disappeared.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is only now, after Metropolitan police detectives cross-referenced all the information gathered by Portuguese detectives, private investigators and the mobile phone data from the resort, that the significance of the witness statements has been fully understood. In an appeal to be broadcast on Monday night on BBC1’s Crimewatch, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood of the Metropolitan police will call for anyone who recognises the man to contact him immediately.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  It is true that some reports referenced the man (singular) as a “suspect,” but it went on to list a number of factors that, again, did not ensure the rumor would stick:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The inquiry is focusing on 41 suspects and requests for assistance have been issued to 30 countries in a bid to identify and eliminate these people, 15 of whom are British. Crimewatch will feature other efits of individuals that the police would also like to trace …
   <strong>
    [The depicted individual] was described by the witnesses as white, aged between 20 and 40,
   </strong>
   with short brown hair, of medium build, medium height and clean shaven.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  John Podesta was
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Podesta" target="_blank">
   67
  </a>
  in December 2016, indicating he was between 58 and 59 at the time of McCann’s disappearance; the man depicted was described as being between the ages of 20 and 40. While only 18 years separate 40 and 58, it would be incredibly difficult to mistake a 60-year-old man for a 20-year-old.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some versions of the rumor claimed that John Podesta was in Portugal around the time of the incident, but
  <a href="http://archive.is/BCWVA" target="_blank">
   referenced
  </a>
  an e-mail about a trip which occurred several months
  <em>
   after
  </em>
  McCann vanished. In another version, Podesta was
  <a href="http://archive.is/wCzpP" target="_blank">
   placed
  </a>
  in Portugal at the time of the disappearance by an unnamed law enforcement source, information that without any supporting evidence was as implausible as it was unreliable.
 </p>
 <p>
  An unrelated (yet notable) aspect of the Podesta brothers and their purportedly eerie resemblance to the Madeleine McCann abduction sketches was that before Pizzagate captivated internet investigators, individuals invested in separate theories
  <a href="http://archive.is/i5QAw" target="_blank">
   peddled
  </a>
  the idea that McCann’s parents Gerry and Kate McCann were depicted in both the same sketch and other police drawings:

 </p>
 <p>
  One version provided an account from a witness, claiming that Gerry McCann closely resembled the suspect police had been seeking — while disregarding the fact that law enforcement agents had access to both the sketches they themselves generated and released as well as Gerry McCann:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   They gave police witness statements – they had seen a man carrying a child on that night. Martin Smith senior, described the man as resembling Gerry McCann, carrying a little girl resembling Madeleine McCann, around the time that Kate McCann supposedly discovered her daughter to be missing.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  It was not just one or two people claiming that Gerry McCann was the man depicted in police sketches (and that the years of law enforcement work on the case simply failed to realize that obvious conclusion). A British tabloid published an
  <a href="http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/346131/Sick-internet-trolls-target-Kate-and-Gerry-McCann-after-Crimewatch-special" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  about the widespread rumors that McCann and the suspect were one and the same, which kicked up after an October 2013 episode of
  <em>
   Crimewatch
  </em>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Scores of people are thought to have made nuisance calls to the inquiry following a fresh appeal for information on the BBC’s Crimewatch show.
  </p>
  <p>
   Many boasted on Twitter about their time-wasting stunts, with some claiming they told the police new e-fits released on the programme looked like Madeleine’s father Gerry, 44.
  </p>
  <p>
   Twitter user LadyReeve wrote: “Awks when the e-fit is Gerry McCann! I’m going to ring in and name him just in case the police haven’t got it yet #Crimewatch.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Another user called KCAEC said: “Who’s gonna be the 1st person to phone in and say they recognise the e-fit……its Gerry McCann!”
  </p>
  <p>
   Someone called Jont-o’-Lantern Gore also tweeted: “Chain smoking pack after pack of cigarettes to change my voice so that I can prank call Crimewatch.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Others on Twitter confirmed that police had been sidetracked by a spate of misleading calls … Trevor Allman, a former London councillor, said: “Apparently a lot of people have pointed out to the police that the e-fit photo on last night’s Crimewatch looks like Gerry McCann.”
  </p>
  <p>
   So far the Crimewatch appeal has generated 2,400 calls and emails to police with information … Detectives are monitoring the internet for vile messages about the couple after a Facebook group targeting the pair attracted 11,000 members.
  </p>

 <p>
  Claims that the Podesta brothers appeared in the sketches and provided a match for the “suspects” was an example of an extremely common conspiracy theory trope. Virtually identical claims were trotted out weeks after the
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/guns/newtown.asp" target="_blank">
   Sandy Hook
  </a>
  mass shooting, when conspiracists claimed that the victims appeared in photographs alongside President Obama.
 </p>
 <p>
  In another version of that theory, five separate and identifiable women were labeled as one “
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/same-girl-crying-now-oregon/" target="_blank">
   crisis actor
  </a>
  ” paid to appear and cry at every mass shooting. While four of the five depicted women had demonstrable discrete lives, identities, and appearances, common traits like long, dark hair were held up as evidence of an extraordinary plot to dupe the public.
