  On 4 September 2017, OurLandOfTheFree.com published a
  <a href="http://ourlandofthefree.com/2017/09/harvey-flooding-uncovers-secret-stash-of-ammo-hidden-by-obama-administration/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   story
  </a>
  purporting to reveal evidence of a “planned coup” by former U.S. President Barack Obama that had been conveniently exposed by Hurricane Harvey:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A cache of weapons long suspected to be hidden in Texas during Operation Jade Helm 15 was uncovered by the flood waters of Hurricane Harvey. The stockpile, hidden in a small town outside of Lexmar, matches numbers in the inventory reported missing during Obama’s tenure.
  </p>
  <p>
   Obama and his administration flat out refused to answer where more than 200 million rounds of ammunition went while he was commander-in-chief. The traitor always maintained that there had to be a clerical error. Now that nearly 10 percent of that ammo has been found, little question remains what happened to it.

 <p>
  The story is a fabrication. The site says as much in a disclaimer:

 <p>
  There are other indications as to the story’s nature. For one, there is no record of a town in Texas called “Lexmar”, let alone any “small towns” near it. The story also includes a picture allegedly taken on 4 September 2017 in “Kirkmere, Texas”:

  Again, there is no record of a community by that name in the state. Also, a search for the image reveals that it was taken in May 2010, just outside what has been

   described

  as a “Russian ammunition warehouse”:

  The story also invoked the name of Operation Jade Helm 15, a 2015 United States military exercise that was the

   focus

  of several conspiracy theories before it began — but which eventually proceeded without incident. While Our Land of the Free is a “satirical” news site, other sites ran their own versions of the same story, mostly verbatim, but without a disclaimer labeling themselves as fictitious.
