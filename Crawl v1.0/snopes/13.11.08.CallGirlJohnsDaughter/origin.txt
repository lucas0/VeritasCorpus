 <p>
  [Collected on the Internet, 1995]A man travels to St. John’s Newfoundland on business from another part of the province. He checks into the Holiday Inn and arranges with the desk clerk to have a hooker sent to his room. A few minutes later, a knock comes on his door, and he opens it to find his own daughter, who was a student at the local university. (Presumably, she found her allowance to be insufficient, probably due to the fact that her father was spending all his money on hookers.)

  An Israeli couple are preparing to divorce after the man summoned a prostitute to his hotel room only to discover she was his daughter.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the prostitute entered the room, the full horror for him of discovering his daughter’s occupation hit him. The father began feeling chest pains which may have been a mild heart attack.
