  The Father of Fake News
 </p>
 <p>
  Ronald Reagan’s FCC abolished the Fairness Doctrine which, since 1949, required media to present both sides’ opinions in the rare event they weren’t just reporting straight news. A Democrat-controlled Congress passed a bill to re-instate the Fairness Doctrine in 1987. Reagan vetoed the bill.

  Fox News followed in the 1990s. America is now more polarized and misinformed than ever.
