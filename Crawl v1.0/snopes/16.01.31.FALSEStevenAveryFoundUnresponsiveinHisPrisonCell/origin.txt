  According to Waupun Correctional Facility representatives, Avery was found unresponsive in his prison cell at approximately 4:30 AM during his cell block’s daily wake-up call. Correctional officers attempted to communicate with Avery, however according to one of the on-scene officers, “He (Avery) just wouldn’t respond, it was pretty obvious to all that were on-scene that the lights were off and nobody was home”.

  The news is disheartening to Avery’s thousands of new-found supporters on the tail of the recent 10 episode Netflix documentary series Making a Murderer. Many supporters that are hopeful Avery would live to see the outside of the Waupun Correctional Facility have taken to social media with an out-pour of support for the Avery family.
