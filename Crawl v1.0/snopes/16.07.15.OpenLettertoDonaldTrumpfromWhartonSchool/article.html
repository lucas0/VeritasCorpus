   You Do Not Represent Us: An Open Letter to Donald Trump
  </p>
  <p>
   At the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, students are taught to represent the highest levels of respect and integrity. We are taught to embrace humility and diversity. We can understand why, in seeking America’s highest office, you have used your degree from Wharton to promote and lend legitimacy to your candidacy.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a candidate for President, and now as the presumptive GOP nominee, you have been afforded a transformative opportunity to be a leader on national and international stages and to make the Wharton community even prouder of our school and values.

  Although the letter was not officially issued or endorsed by Wharton, more than 3,000 of the school’s current students, graduates, and staff members have signed it. Although the signatory page asks for an .edu email address to verify that signers are undergraduate/graduate student/alumni of Wharton or Penn, the letter can also be signed by friends, family members and supporters of Wharton (and Penn) students.
