  The review sections for all of these pages were quickly filled with politically charged comments, including several people who claimed that the ornaments were made in China:

 </p>
 <p>
  These claims were not accompanied by any evidence: no photographs were provided showing that the ornaments were labeled “made in China,” and even if they were, the Amazon listings came from third-party sellers and were not officially affiliated with the Trump campaign.
 </p>
 <p>
  The official listing on Donald Trump’s web site states that the ornaments were “proudly made in the USA”:

  that the ornaments were products of the United States.
 </p>
 <p>
  The claims that Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” Christmas ornaments were actually made in China appear to have originated in the review section of an Amazon.com page that (like many Amazon pages) was filled with politically charged comments and jokes. The Trump campaign, however, stated that the ornaments are indeed made in the United States.
