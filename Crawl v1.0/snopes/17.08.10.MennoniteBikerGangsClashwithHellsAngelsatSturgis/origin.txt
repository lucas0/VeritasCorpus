  South Dakota police were on high alert this weekend as a notorious horse-and-buggy Mennonite gang known as ‘The Swartzentrubers’ descended on Sturgis for the annual motorcycle rally. Authorities were concerned that the introduction of more than 10,000 Mennonite and Amish buggies would not be received well by the more established biker gangs.

  “I don’t want horse shit all over my Harley tires!” said rival chapter leader Archie Harrison. “Let me tell you, this is our turf and if those Mennonites so much as open a hymnal around here there’ll be hell to pay!”
