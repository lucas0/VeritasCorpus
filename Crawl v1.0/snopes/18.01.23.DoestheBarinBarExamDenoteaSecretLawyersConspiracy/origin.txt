<blockquote>
 <p>
  During the middle 1600’s, the Crown of England established a formal registry in London where barristers [lawyers] were ordered by the Crown to be accredited. The establishment of this first International Bar Association
  <b>
  </b>
  allowed barrister-lawyers from all nations to be formally recognized and accredited by the only recognized accreditation society.
 </p>
 <p>
  From this, the acronym BAR
  <b>
  </b>
  was established denoting (informally) the British Accredited Registry, whose members became a powerful and integral force within the International Bar Association (IBA). Although this has been denied repeatedly as to its existence, the acronym BAR stood for the British barrister-lawyers who were members of the larger IBA.
