  FEMA is looking to hire help. $2000 per week plus expenses. 90 days or longer they need over 1000 people. Cannot have any felonies. 888 776 1296. Mr. Adrian Davis.

   True of False?
   <br/>
   I have not been able to verify this-the phone number goes from a fast busy to a regular busy.
   <br/>
   Thank you

  There is a post going around Facebook seeking FEMA Field Inspectors. $4-5 K per week. No experience necessary. The ad contains an error: “Will be reimburse travel”
  <br/>
  The phone number to call is 214-[redacted].
  <br/>
  All sounds too good to be true and I don’t see anything similar on the FEMA website or Facebook page.

  Can you please check out a rumor via Facebook that FEMA is paying people up to 5,000 dollars per week to work in Houston as field inspectors. They have to call 214.[redacted] to register.
  <br/>
  Why wouldn’t the FEMA hire people directly? Sounds like a HUGE scam to me!!
