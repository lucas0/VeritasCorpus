  On 1 April 2016, a video purportedly showing Donald Trump announcing that his presidential campaign had been an April Fool’s Day joke all along was shared on social media:

  <p>
   Donald Trump announced today that the whole campaign was a complete joke and he will be pulling out of the campaign and endorsing Hillary Clinton
  </p>

  In addition to the video, people on social media expressed some wishful thinking about Donald Trump’s campaign being a possible, long-running prank:

  The combination of people commenting that Donald Trump’s campaign was a joke, along with a video that purported to show Trump making an April Fool’s Day announcement, led many to believe that Trump had actually suspended his campaign.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is not the case, however. The video was created for a late-night comedy television
  <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/jimmy-kimmel-live" target="_blank">
   show
  </a>
  ,
  <em>
   Jimmy Kimmel Live!
  </em>
  While the above-displayed video edited out Kimmel’s introduction, the original video makes it clear that the announcement was just another April Fool’s Day prank:

   This is something you’re going to be hearing a lot about over the next several days. Donald Trump recently made a bombshell revelation that could make you question everything you know about the state of American politics.
