  The image shown above, stating that it costs U.S. taxpayers $200,000 per hour to maintain and operate the official White House jet, Air Force One, was circulated heavily in the final months of the 2016 presidential campaign, during which President Obama made at least a dozen trips around the country to

  It echoed a sentiment tweeted that July by Republican candidate Donald Trump, who complained that taxpayers were paying a “fortune” for Obama and Clinton to take Air Force One to North Carolina for a joint campaign

  These are worthwhile questions to ask: How much does it really cost to operate Air Force One? And is it true that taxpayers have to foot the entire bill, even when the president isn’t traveling on official business?
 </p>
 <p>
  The first question to consider is how much the use of Air Force One really costs U.S. taxpayers. The “$200,000 per hour” cost of Air Force One (or, more specifically, of the Boeing VC-25A aircraft on which the President usually travels) is a commonly cited figure, but it is both variable and highly misleading.  For starters, the National Taxpayers Union Foundation (NTUF)
  <a href="http://www.ntu.org/foundation/detail/presidential-travel-costs-to-taxpayers-april-snapshot" target="_blank">
   reported

  in April 2016 that the cost per flight hour (CPFH) for Air Force One had decreased in the last few years:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The most easily quantifiable item to estimate is the cost to operate Air Force One (AF1), a Boeing VC-25A, the military version of the 747 aircraft. Some good news for taxpayers is that the costs per flight hour for AF1 has gone down again. In 2013, it cost $228,288. Last year, it was reported at $206,337 per flight hour. In response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed by Judicial Watch, the Air Force reported that the FY 2016 cost per flight hour for the AF1 is $180,118.
