  reporting (somewhat incoherently) that leading Democratic figures — in addition to billionaire George Soros — had “worlds to gain” by effecting a shutdown of the U.S. federal government, and that the shutdown was somehow connected to a Secret Service report warning of a military coup against President Trump:

    “Be advised that actionable intel has been gathered from those friendly to ‘Juicer’ suggesting the possibility of a military coup against POTUS. Service policy dictates that those attatched directly to POTUS remain by his side to the bunker while all others secure the grounds of the White House. Anyone not already inside the building when a coup lockdown occurs is considered the enemy and will be shot on breach of the outer gate.”

  in January 2018 as Republicans and Democrats wrangled over immigration policy and other issues.  The U.S. Secret Service issued no such report, nor did any credible news organization cover such an occurrence.  This story originated solely with
