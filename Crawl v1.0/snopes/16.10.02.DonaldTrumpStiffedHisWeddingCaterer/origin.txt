  Today I did something I never did before — I ‘defriended’ someone who chastised me in a letter about how offended she was by “Trumped Up Cards,” and how she wanted me to know she was voting for Trump. This was not a fb friend, but someone who subscribes to my website newsletter (christinelavin.com). So I told her a true story I’ve known about Trump since 1994.
 </p>
 <p>
  An actor friend of mine worked for a caterer in 1993. It was a new caterer, and this caterer was thrilled to land the kind of job that can really boost a career — catering Donald Trump and Marla Maples wedding. At the time she wondered why he didn’t hire other caterers he’d used in the past, but just thanked her lucky stars he hired her.

 <p>
  Everything went beautifully — the food was a hit, the waiters/waitresses all were totally professional. Everything was first rate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Donald Trump refused to pay the bill. He told the caterer, “I know you are new at this, and when you tell people you catered MY wedding, you will get more business than you could ever dream of. So I am doing you a favor. And when I do favors, I don’t pay. End of discussion.”

  This is not a story I recently heard — it’s one I heard 22 years ago. We know many stories like this now.
