  On October 9th, 2016, WikiLeaks disclosed thousands of e-mails from the personal account of Hillary Clinton campaign director John Podesta, also a former counselor to President Barack Obama. Among those files were two e-mails signed by former NASA astronaut Edgar D. Mitchell from the e-mail address terribillionairs@aol.com.

 <p>
  The first
  <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1766" target="_blank">
   message
  </a>
  , dated 18 January 2015, read:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Subject: email for John Podesta (c/o Eryn) from Edgar Mitchel re meeting ASAP
  </p>
  <p>
   Dear John,
  </p>
  <p>
   As 2015 unfolds, I understand you are leaving the Administration in February.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is urgent that we agree on a date and time to meet to discuss Disclosure and Zero Point Energy, at your earliest available after your departure.
  </p>
  <p>
   My Catholic colleague Terri Mansfield will be there too, to bring us up to date on the Vatican’s awareness of ETI [extraterrestrial intelligence].
  </p>
  <p>
   Another colleague is working on a new Space Treaty, citing involvement with Russia and China. However with Russia’s extreme interference in Ukraine, I believe we must pursue another route for peace in space and ZPE on Earth.
  </p>
  <p>
   I met with President Obama’s Honolulu childhood friend, US Ambassador Pamela Hamamoto on July 4 at the US Mission in Geneva, when I was able to tell her briefly about zero point energy.
  </p>
  <p>
   I believe we can enlist her as a confidante and resource in our presentation for President Obama.
  </p>
  <p>
   I appreciate Eryn’s assistance in working with Terri to set up our meeting.
  </p>
  <p>
   Best regards,
   <br>

  The second
  <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1802" target="_blank">
   message
  </a>
  , dated 18 August 2015, included a brief introduction and a series of links to articles that primarily discussed the militarization of space. It bore the same signature as the first e-mail:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Subject: email for John Podesta c/o Eryn re Space Treaty (attached)
  </p>
  <p>
   Dear John,
  </p>
  <p>
   Because the War in Space race is heating up, I felt you should be aware of several factors as you and I schedule our Skype talk.
  </p>
  <p>
   Remember, our nonviolent ETI from the contiguous universe are helping us bring zero point energy to Earth. They will not tolerate any forms of military violence on Earth or in space.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following information in italics was shared with me by my colleague Carol Rosin, who worked closely for several years with Wernher von Braun before his death.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carol and I have worked on the Treaty on the Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space, attached for your convenience.
  </p>
  <p>
   Best regards,

  Before diving into the content of these two e-mails, we should identify the players involved.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dr. Edgar Mitchell (who passed away in 2016) was a NASA astronaut who traveled to (and walked on) the moon as part of the Apollo 14 mission in 1971. A Presidential Medal of Freedom
  <a href="http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/mitchell-ed.html" target="_blank">

  , he once completed a
  <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo14.html#.V_2UJ6IrI_M" target="_blank">
   record-breaking
  </a>
  nine-hour, 24-minute EVA on the surface of the moon. In addition to his distinguished scientific career with NASA, he was a strong believer in metaphysical phenomena. He claimed, for example, that a Toronto-based healer named “
  <a href="http://www.jillneimark.com/pdf/BigBird.pdf" target="_blank">
   Adam Dreamhealer
  </a>
  ” had cured him of kidney cancer remotely while the two men were separated by thousands of miles. He also was a strong believer in the existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life and claimed Earth had frequently been visited by aliens. Among the many times he made these assertions was in a 2009
  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/deadlineusa/2009/apr/22/ufos-apollo-astronaut-extraterrestrials" target="_blank">
   interview
  </a>
  with the
  <em>
   Guardian
  </em>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “We are being visited,” [Mitchell] said. “It is now time to put away this embargo of truth about the alien presence. I call upon our government to open up … and become a part of this planetary community that is now trying to take our proper role as a spacefaring civilisation.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Though Mitchell signed the messages, the e-mail address from which they originated
  <a href="http://www.terrimansfield.com/contact-us/" target="_blank">
   belonged
  </a>
  to Terri Mansfield (Mitchell’s “Catholic colleague”), who runs a
  <a href="http://www.terrimansfield.com/" target="_blank">
   nonprofit
  </a>
  that focuses on metaphysical concepts including consciousness, god, extraterrestrial intelligence, and the development of technology that could harness zero point energy (a pseudoscientific concept discussed below).
 </p>
 <p>
  Carol Rosin, whom Mitchell mentions as having helped to collect the links listed in the second e-mail, states on her
  <a href="http://www.peaceinspace.com/dr-carol-rosin" target="_blank">
   web site
  </a>
  that she is the founder of the Institute for Security and Cooperation in Outer Space. On the same site, she describes her role as “advis[ing] decision makers and others about applications of technology and information services for human needs, environment, new energy, and peace and security, health and prosperity for all on earth and in space.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Mansfield and Rosin’s connection to Mitchell does not necessarily imply influence or authorship of these emails, as the content is consistent with causes he championed. In fact, Rebecca Hardcastle Wright, a
  <a href="http://rebeccahardcastlewright.com/2016/02/06/dr-edgar-mitchells-quantrek-legacy-zero-point-energy-consciousness-and-the-extraterrestrial-presence/" target="_blank">
   former employee
  </a>
  of Mitchell’s, wrote a

  attesting to their authenticity, confirming that a Skype meeting with Podesta had been requested by Mitchell but never ended up taking place.
