  On 8 December 2014, a video was uploaded to YouTube showing two hikers walking on a lake of ice so clear it appeared as if they were walking on air, with the uploader describing what it depicted as “Me and my friend walking on frozen mountain lake in High Tatras Mountains in Slovakia.”

  That video racked up more than four million views in just a few short days. While most viewers were simply amazed at the beauty of the frozen lake in the Tatras Mountains shown in the video, others were skeptical about the authenticity of the scene.

  a sudden drop in temperature amid a snowless stretch of weather could result in the conditions seen in the video above:

   It is only possible when the temperatures fall from being relatively mild to very cold very quickly, and at the same time it’s important that there has not been any snow which tends to make the ice very cloudy. And we have had those conditions lately which would explain this very clear ice.
