  There was no truth to this article.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to falsely reporting that John Amos had died,
  <em>
   Headline NewsNetwork
  </em>
  also made the mistake of stating that “
  <em>
   she
  </em>
  was 77″ despite the fact that they had identified Amos as an actor, not an actress, 15 words earlier.

 <p>
  Monica J. McKnight, a manager for Amos, posted a message on her

  confirming that Amos was still alive and well. The message was also reported on Amos’ official

  While the news about Amos’ alleged demise originated on a disreputable web site, many viewers may have readily accepted it as true at the time due to a
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2016/12/28/2016-the-deadliest-year-for-celebrities/" target="_blank">
   perceived increase

  in celebrity deaths during 2016. Although some people claimed that 2016 was the
  <a href="https://www.snopes.com/2016/12/28/2016-the-deadliest-year-for-celebrities/" target="de">
   deadliest

  years for celebrities, we found that this wasn’t quite the case.
