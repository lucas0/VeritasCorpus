  Hey Louie! Do you want to play with my balls?
  <br>
   Sure Chuck! I can hold your ball sack so it won’t drag on the ground.
   <br/>
   Wow! Your balls are so big, I can’t even fit them in my mouth!
   <br/>
   My mom’s always yelling, “Louie! Get those balls out of your mouth before you choke!”
   <br/>
   You know that mean girl Sally? She squeezed my balls so hard they looked funny.
   <br/>
   Yeah, well when I play with Sally … I always end up with blue balls.
   <br/>
   Billy Johnson made Sally cry last week. Now that kid’s got balls!
