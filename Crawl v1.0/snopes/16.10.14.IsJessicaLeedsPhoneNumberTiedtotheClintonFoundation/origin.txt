  [When Trump denied sexually aggressive behavior during an October 2016 debate], sitting at home in Manhattan, Jessica Leeds, 74, felt he was lying to her face. “I wanted to punch the screen,” she said in an interview in her apartment.

  More than three decades ago, when she was a traveling businesswoman at a paper company, Ms. Leeds said, she sat beside Mr. Trump in the first-class cabin of a flight to New York. They had never met before.

  About 45 minutes after takeoff, she recalled, Mr. Trump lifted the armrest and began to touch her.

  According to Ms. Leeds, Mr. Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt.

  “He was like an octopus,” she said. “His hands were everywhere.”
