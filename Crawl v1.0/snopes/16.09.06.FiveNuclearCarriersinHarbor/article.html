  The above-displayed photograph of ships lined up at the piers of the Norfolk Naval Base was widely circulated online beginning in
  <nobr>
   March 2013
  </nobr>
  with accompanying claims that it showed five U.S. aircraft carriers simultaneously docked in the same place for the first time since World
  <nobr>
   War II.
  </nobr>
  Although the photograph is genuine, and five carriers were indeed docked at Norfolk at the same time, most of the claims in the accompanying text are exaggerated or untrue: the ships were not all “first line” carriers, nor were they “pulled out from the Middle East” and “ordered into harbor for routine inspections,” and the situation was not the first occurrence of its type since World
  <nobr>
   War II,
  </nobr>
  nor was it a “breach of long-standing military protocol.”

  Although the Norfolk photograph was circulated in March 2013 as something snapped “the other day,” it was actually taken in mid-December 2012, when many

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Five aircraft carriers, four big-deck amphibious assault ships, a full cast of “small boy” surface warships, along with nuclear submarines and support ships, are crowding the [Norfolk] base, giving a comfortably snug feeling to the waterfront. Similar scenes — although not with the gathering of flattops seen here — are taking place at other fleet concentration areas like San Diego and Pearl Harbor.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Navy makes a point of trying to gives its shipboard crews a chance to spend Christmas with their families, and for a few days  the percentage of ships underway drops to the lowest point it will be all year. But many of these ships will be gone in two weeks as the pace of operations picks up again.
