 <p>
  Officers of the Bell County Sheriff Department have mistakenly shot an unarmed coal miner, thinking he was a black criminal.
 </p>
 <p>
  37-year old Jason Morris had just finished his night shift in a mine operated by the Bell County Coal Corporation and was boarding his vehicle to head home, when the deputies arrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seeing a dark faced individual enter a brand new Lincoln Navigator worth more than $75,000, the officers believed he was an African American man attempting to steal a vehicle.
 </p>
 <p>
  After he ignored three shouted warnings from the deputies, Mr Morris was shot five times in the back, in both legs and in the left arm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many miners witnessed the incident, and all of them insist that the shooting was totally unprovoked and unjustified.
