   With less than a month before the presidential election, new evidence is surfacing that alleges to show widespread voter fraud carried out by Hillary Clinton supporters during the primary election in at least 3 key states.

Several show election judges working together — sometimes even serving as “look outs” — to slip presumably fraudulent Clinton votes in with the rest of the ballots.
