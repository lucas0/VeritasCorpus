  </span>
  2015, the web site
  <em>
   Celebtricity
  </em>
  published an article reporting that actor
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   Bryshere Y. Gray,
  </span>
  who plays Hakeem Lyon on the show
  <em>
   Empire
  </em>
  , was the biological son of rap mogul
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   Jay-Z:

 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   DNA analysis has been released revealing that
   <span style="white-space: nowrap">
    Bryshere Y. Gray
   </span>
   also known as Yass the Greatest who plays Hakeem Lyon on the hit show Empire is actually the biological son of rap mogul
   <span style="white-space: nowrap">
    Jay-Z.
   </span>
   This doesn’t come as too much of a shock as the rapper’s dalliances are well accounted for, but it does ask the question of whether or not Bryshere will inherit “The Rock” from his estranged father.
  </p>
  <p>
   <span style="white-space: nowrap">
    Jay-Z
   </span>
   proudly confirmed that he is in fact his father in an interview by saying:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Yea that’s Blue Ivy’s big brother can’t you tell that’s my genes that gave him his skills. I’m proud of my son I might sign him to Roc Nation if it makes sense.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Byshere’s mother “Donut” Shannon Bryshere was one of
   <span style="white-space: nowrap">
    Jay-Z’s
   </span>
   “ghetto flowers” back in the day when he was selling drugs to help support his musical career. The two distanced themselves from one another after Donut took the fall for a drug charge to keep
   <span style="white-space: nowrap">
    Jay-Z
   </span>
   from going to prison.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Celebriticity
  </em>
  bills itself as the “most notorious entertainment website in the world” which uses a combination of “real &amp; satire news” to create the “most shocking headlines.” In this case, the real portion of the above-quoted story is that both
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   Jay-Z
  </span>
  and
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   Bryshere Y. Gray
  </span>
  do in fact exist. The “satire” (i.e., fake) portion of the article is everything else.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no DNA test,
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   Jay-Z
  </span>
  never said that Hakeem was his real son, and the story about
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   Jay-Z’s
  </span>
  having a fling with a woman named “Donut” is apocryphal. While this rumor was picked up by several other disreputable wen sites, news about
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   Jay-Z’s
  </span>
  alleged son was not reported by any credible news outlet.
