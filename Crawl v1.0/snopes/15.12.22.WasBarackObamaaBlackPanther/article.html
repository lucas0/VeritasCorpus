  and then deleted  it (presumably because someone pointed out the photograph was not an authentic depiction of President Obama), but it remained visible in the above-linked reverse image search result.

  The precise source of the unaltered photograph is unclear, as versions of it posted online were invariably found on sites that used it as a general illustration of content relating to Black Panthers rather than discussion of a specific event. A visible date stamp appeared to suggest the original photograph was taken in 1998.
