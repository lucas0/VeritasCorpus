  recirculated, appearing to report that a Chicago-area janitor had collected $20 million in benefits by taking out life insurance policies on several teenagers who were later murdered:

   State Farm is investigating several claims totaling $47.8 million in which he has already collected $20 million from the deaths of Chicago teenagers he placed life insurance policies on. There are some discrepancies on how he was able to obtain all their social security numbers considering he was a custodian at the school were all of the teens attended.
