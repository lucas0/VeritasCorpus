  Normally when I hear embarassing stories about my friends I sort of chuckle a little and let it pass; however, when my friend at CU Boulder wrote me this letter telling me about her embarrassing experience, as sick as it was, I could not help but become hysterical, and I know with the sick sense of humor my friends have, that ya’ll would appreciate this as well. I asked my friend if I could write it up; she didn’t mind as long as I didn’t use her name, so here it is . . . this one’s for you Wood. — AmandaAn anonymous girl — let’s call her “Jen” — is a junior in college attending school in Colorado; like all college students, she is wrapped up in the partying and the wildness college life has to offer. Jen being the computer science major that she is, does however have a lot of work to do on her computer, so when she’s not out having a good time, she’s working her butt off designing computer programs and installing software.

  One day, soon after she had broken up with her boyfriend, she was home alone on a Friday night for the first time in the three years they had been dating. She was sad, alone, and depressed, so she decided to make a new homepage. She was playing on the net when she decided to get onto a chat line; being the wild psycho she is she decided to get onto a sex line. So Jen got onto a sex chat line and started playing around on it. Over the line she met a guy who identified himself as Jeremy. She started playing with him: she gave a false name, saying her name was “Katie,” and started getting into detail about what she would like to do to him with her tongue. He responded by telling her to picture being naked while his hands ran over every square inch of her body. Soon they were having cybersex.

  This went on for awhile, and then she got off the line, agreeing to meet him back on the line the following night. Saturday night rolls around, and Jen is on the line with Jeremy again. They become even closer this night, so they continue like this for a week. At the end of the week, they started talking about other things and got into very intimate issues and feelings. They became close, exchanging their lives; Jen didn’t tell Jeremy she was in college because she was afraid of sounding like an immature college girl. She felt guilty, but after a few weeks she really liked this guy. This went on with the two of them like this for months, and months turned into a year. By the end of the year they had exchanged the most intimate thoughts and yet had never even spoken on the phone: they were afraid of ruining the mystery. They had done everything sexually possible over the net; they were affectionate as well, waiting for the day that they could some day be together.

  They finally decided they had had enough. They wanted to meet each other, they were in love, and they had to meet. They didn’t care about age or looks or anything but each other. Jeremy told Jen he thought she could be his next wife. Jen was leery at first but decided she didn’t care how old he was or how ugly: she loved him; he was the only one she could feel comfortable with. So . . . they planned a trip to meet in Vail, Colorado. They were going to spend the weekend together and finally meet. Jen didn’t want the hassle of having to find him, so she said, why don’t you just get the room and we’ll meet in the room; that way there will be no mistake. Jeremy agreed.

  Jen showed up at the resort first and checked into the room, telling the desk lady to hold the key for the next
  <br>
   party. She went into the room. She wanted things to be special, so she lit some candles and put on some music. She stripped naked and climbed into the bed under the covers, deciding to surprise Jeremy when he got there. The time soon came: the lights were out, the mood was right, and she heard a key in the door. She heard someone walk in and around the corner, and she whispered, “Jeremy.” Jeremy said, “Katie?” (this was the false name she had given him). “Yes,” she said, so he fumbled for the light, and turned it on to see Jen on the bed naked before him. Then next thing heard around the world were two blood curling screams. Jen covered herself up, and with her most humiliating voice said, “Dad?” Jeremy said, “JEN!!!”

  Think of what you would do in this situation . . . now realize this really did happen. Their lives will never be the same.
