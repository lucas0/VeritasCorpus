  There is no truth to the sensational headline, a claim which would have made worldwide news if it were accurate; indeed, the image used here is actually from
  <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR0002.pdf" target="_blank">
   July 1997
  </a>
  , when a Federal Express plane crashed and burned during a landing at Newark International Airport. (Despite the dramatic image, only minor injuries were reported.)
 </p>
 <p>
  Before claiming Marla Maples was killed in a plane crash, True Trumpers reported (falsely) that Vice-President
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/mike-pence-staffers-die/" target="_blank">
   Mike Pence
  </a>
  and 23 staffers died in the same manner in March 2017.
