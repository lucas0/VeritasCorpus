  This item is a good example of the pitfalls of allowing pure skepticism to overwhelm ordinary evidence.  After we originally put this picture and story up with an “Undetermined” status back in
  <nobr>
   December 2000,
  </nobr>
  we received plenty of mail from self-proclaimed digital photo experts offering numerous reasons (both physical and digital) why the picture couldn’t possibly be real.

  Then we starting hearing from people who were in Waldorf, Maryland, that day (including employees of the Home Depot store where the building materials were purchased and the IHoP restaurant seen in the background of the photo) and actually saw the car, some of whom took their own pictures of it and sent them along to us, such as the following:

  Then we also started finding news stories about the “lumber car,” including one from an enterprising reporter who tracked the hapless couple down through their license plates.

  A 2012 variant of this item ended with the sentences, “And to top it off, he had an Obama/Biden bumper sticker. And these people VOTE!”  This statement is clearly impossible, as the accompanying photo was originally posted in December 2000, nearly eight years before the election featuring an Obama/Biden ticket was held.
