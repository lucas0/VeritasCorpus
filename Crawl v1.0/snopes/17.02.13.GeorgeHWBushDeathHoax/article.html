  Reports that former president George H.W. Bush had passed away were circulated online in mid-February 2017:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Former USA President George H.W. Bush died on Saturday after suffering a heart attack, America’s Public broadcaster said. He was 93.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a sign of mourning, PCTV channel 26 aired a black banner on the corner of its broadcast. Several people have sent their condolence messages including President Trump on his Twitter handle. Others have confessed how important he was.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  There was no truth to this story. As of this writing, George H.W. Bush is still alive.
