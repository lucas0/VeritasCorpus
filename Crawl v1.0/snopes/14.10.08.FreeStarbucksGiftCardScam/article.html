    Origins:
   </b>
  </span>
  In mid-October 2011, a survey scam purporting to offer free $50 or $100 Starbucks gift cards to those who followed particular links then did as told once there spread via e-mail and Facebook. Those who went in search of the promised freebies were asked to click what appeared to be Facebook “share” buttons and post comments to the scammer’s site.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those who followed such instructions were then led into a series of surveys they were instructed to complete before their gift cards could be sent to them. As always with such cons, there were no gift cards to be had.
 </p>
 <p>
  The “Starbucks gift card” con is a copy of the days-earlier
  <a href="/inboxer/nothing/timhortons.asp" target="horton">

  </a>
  survey scam, which itself was a clone of the survey scam falsely offering free
  <a href="/inboxer/nothing/stevejobs.asp" target="apple">
   Apple
  </a>
  iPods, iPhones, or MacBooks in memory of Steve Jobs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Starbucks was founded in 1971, which does indeed make it 40 years old as of 2011. However, that’s the only thing the e-mailed and Facebook-spread hoax had right.

    Variations:
   </b>
  </span>
  In December 2017, a similar Starbucks $50 gift card scam circulated on Facebook. That subsequent iteration was another version of the common
  <a href="https://www.snopes.com/sharpie-anniversary-giveaway-scam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   anniversary survey scam
  </a>
  , promising a phantom $50 gift card to folks who liked a page and shared a link (thus recruiting more of their friends to spread the link). As is often the case, the “coupon” linked not to a legitimate Starbucks domain, but to a completely unrelated URL.
 </p>
 <p>
  Users who clicked the link were taken to a “survey” rife with typographical errors, any combination of which would result in their purportedly winning a $50 gift card — so long as the user liked, shared, and spread the link on Facebook:
