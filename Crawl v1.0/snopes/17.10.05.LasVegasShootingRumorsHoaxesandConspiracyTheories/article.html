  On 1 October 2017, a shooter opened fire on an outdoor country music festival in

   Las
  </a>
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/tag/las-vegas-mass-shooting/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   Vegas
  </a>
  , killing 58 people and wounding hundreds. As is often the case with major or tragic events, rumors immediately began to flow, even before the shooting ended and the investigation began.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shooting began just after 10 P.M. local time (or after midnight on 2 October 2017 on the East Coast). Many of the claims circulated during prior mass shootings and reflected “tropes” commonly invoked by such events, and others were unique to the incident and circumstances:
 </p>
 <h3>
  <strong>
   Was the Islamic State responsible for the Las Vegas massacre?
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Although outbreaks of violence are frequently attributed to the
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2017/10/02/isis-claim-of-responsibility-for-las-vegas-shooting-confounds-experts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   Islamic State
  </a>
  before an initial investigation takes place, a propaganda arm for the group attempted to claim responsibility for the attack. However, investigators quickly ruled out their involvement in the shooting.
 </p>
 <h3>
  <strong>
   What about antifa? Did they claim responsibility?
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p>
  No. A Facebook page claiming to be run by
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/did-melbourne-antifa-claim-responsibility-for-the-vegas-massacre/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   antifa
  </a>
  operatives in Melbourne, Australia posted and then deleted a status update essentially blaming the massacre on American antifa protesters. However, credible news sources and the group itself pegged the Facebook source as phony
  <em>
   before
  </em>
  the Las Vegas shooting.
 </p>
 <h3>
  <strong>
   Did eagle-eyed web sleuths unmask the shooter at an anti-Trump rally?

 <h3>
  <strong>
   Did a “mysterious woman” filter through the crowd, screaming warnings about the shooting forty-five minutes before it happened?
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Oftentimes, initial compelling rumors continue spreading long after a mundane explanation has emerged. Many social media users heard about an
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/woman-warned-las-vegas-shooting/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   eerie warning
  </a>
  spread by a visibly agitated woman nearly an hour prior to the massacre, but far fewer saw that the witness to that purported prediction later walked her claims back significantly.
 </p>
 <h3>
  <strong>
   Are there unanswered questions about whether there was a “second shooter,” multiple shooters, or from where the bullets were fired?
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p>
  No. The concept of a “
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/second-gunman-shoot-fourth-floor-mandalay-bay/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   second shooter
  </a>
  ” became embedded in American consciousness after the first

   I want to say this right now while it’s fresh. People PLEASE listen to me! There are bad people in this world, but tonight, I saw every race and gender come together to save lives and protect each other. I had women tie my leg up to stop the bleeding, I had men carrying me on their back to safety and I had many black officers and civilians holding my hand and staying with me every second of the way. Our president is far from perfect, but the divide this country is being created by media and the select few cases that they spread world wide. But you don’t get to see the good in people. I’m lying in my hospital bed right now in tears, not because I’m injured but because I did my best to save lives and not once did I see color or gender. Nor did anyone else. My friends, please please take a step back, turn off the tv and go love the person next to you. Black, white, Mexican, straight, gay or anything else. Love on them and show that we are united as one in this country and NO ONE, no matter how hard they try, can’t break us! Ever!

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   So here goes…. Especially to those of you saying to stop talking about this, stop making assumptions etc.
  </p>
  <p>
   Call me crazy, call me dramatic, call me whatever you want. I’m posting this for those of us who were on the strip Sunday night, who know what we saw and what we were told by police officers, security guards, and even the local news when all of this madness started. And I am posting this in hopes of informing others who have believed everything they’ve seen on the news. If while leaving the Cosmopolitan, we had been told there was one shooting at the Mandalay Bay, Anthony and I would have not been worried for our lives and we would have continued to go out, knowing we weren’t headed to that particular area of the strip. But that’s not what we were told. We were told that there were 7 confirmed shooters, and confirmed deaths at multiple hotels. Including Bellagio, the Aria and New York New York. Being told this by a security guard, who then told us to go to the third floor for safety. However, Anthony says, “No Rikki. This is a very popular hotel, I don’t feel like the third floor of this popular hotel in public is the safest place. We’re going to try and get out of here right now.” Running back to our hotel next door, Vdara, we are told once again by police/security checking our id and room key, “yes multiple hotels effected. Go to your room and do not leave.” We then get to the room, immediately turn on the news and start watching out of our windows to figure out what is going on. The news also states, live, that the Bellagio had been effected and there was one confirmed death.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now… skip ahead about an hour. The news is no longer stating anything about the other hotels effected. They say it is one person. Every bit of info that was being initially given to us was disappearing. We could physically see from our window view, fire alarms going off at the cosmopolitan, and multiple cop cars and ambulances pulling up there as well. We wanted more information about what was happening at these other hotels right next to us, and we weren’t getting it. And we still aren’t.
   <br/>
   Monday morning I am of course telling my friends and family about our experience, and I was starting to really feel like I was crazy. Everyone was telling me there was only one shooter, and I just couldn’t understand what I had seen. Finally, other people like myself started speaking out. I was relieved to know that I wasn’t crazy, but now just as confused as to why the media is trying to hide this information. There are now videos and statements popping up all over the web, showing proof of other shooters and other effected hotels.
  </p>
  <p>
   Why are they trying to hide this?! If for no other reason, think about being a family member of the others who died or were injured at these other hotels. They deserve the respect, and the truth as to what happened to their loved ones.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now, can we please stop talking about Gun Control for just a few minutes, and figure out what is really going on here? Figure out the real motive of this incident, and inform people of the truth. Laws can be put in place for anything and everything. There will always be people who break them. And especially with all of the technology we have now days, it is not very hard to find anything you want. Whether it’s an illegal weapon, drugs, anything. Laws will always be broken. So let’s stop pretending this incident wouldn’t have happened if more laws were in place, but instead demand the truth about what really happened that night, and why? Don’t be so naive.

  Although this rumor is a variation on the “second shooter” claim, it also fails to take into account the difficulties faced by eyewitnesses in identifying the specifics of the shooting as it happened.
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to the close proximity most Vegas casinos share (many are connected to neighboring venues) and the acoustics of the Strip, a barrage of gunfire from one location could easily be mistaken for one from somewhere nearby.

   Once again we have a tragic event in America, and just like massive protests across America the Las Vegas shooting had ads for actors on Crowds On Demand back in August before the shooting. Two things seem to pop up after major events take place in America in the last year or so, and that is we get a fucked up investigation and there always seems to be ads for actors before an event like the Las Vegas shooting. So now we have new evidence with crisis actors being looked for on Craigslist and Crowds On Demand a month before the Las Vegas event…I think it’s time we launch an investigation into Crowds On Demand don’t you?

  the same day (in a post riddled with typographical errors) that the suspicious advertisement had conveniently been deleted after the Las Vegas shooting:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A California based company called ‘Crowds on Demand’ placed an advert back in August for ‘crisi actors in the Las Vegas area.
  </p>
  <p>
   The adverts, which has since been removed, advertised for protests, Rallies, Audiences, PR Stunts, and Celebrity Events.
  </p>
  <p>
   Crowds on Demand had also placed the same advert on Backstage.com, and as of today, it is still online:Note the wording – “attending a show/concert” … So is it just a coincidence that 6 weeks before the La Vegas shooting farce, we have a notorious company known for hiring crisis actors placing adverts to recruit people as crisis actors for an unspecified event in Las Vegas?

  Moreover, anti-semitic conspiracy theorists previously set their sights on the same posting — as part of predictions that bad actors planned chaos for the then-recent

  bout. Another post in a general conspiracy forum

  :

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   It’s obvious to most that a race war is being pushed. The McGregor/Mayweather fight could be used as a catalyst for such. Mayweather has already planted seeds by calling McGregor racist (even though Floyd referred to Pacquiao as a little yellow monkey).
  </p>
  <p>
   Today an ad was found on Craigslist looking for crisis actors in Vegas. It’s been up for two weeks. A friend called, and the dates these “actors” are needed is Aug 25th – Aug 27th.
  </p>
  <p>
   Awfully coincidental, eh?

   Be careful ya’ll, remember to let your love and light shine above all else.

  Even after Vegas shooting conspiracies had begun circulating, forum posters
  <a href="https://archive.is/6XGEm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   recalled
  </a>
  the post as linked to the boxing match. Although there was some
  <a href="https://archive.is/nEgPs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   confusion
  </a>
  , posters for the most part correctly identified the Craigslist post as dated to early August 2017. The advertisement was legitimate, but it was retrofitted to align with false flag theories about the Vegas shooting and its original connotations (fizzled predictions about a “race war” at a boxing match) were elided in the retelling. Claims that it “disappeared” were down to the fact the page was more than 45 days old at the time it recaptured social media attention.
