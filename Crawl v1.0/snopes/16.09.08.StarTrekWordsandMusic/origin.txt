<blockquote>
 <p>
  Beyond
  <br>
   The rim of the star-light
   <br/>
   My love
   <br/>
   Is wand’ring in star-flight
   <br/>
   I know
   <br/>
   He’ll find in star-clustered reaches
   <br/>
   Love,
   <br/>
   Strange love a star woman teaches.
   <br/>
   I know
   <br/>
   His journey ends never
   <br/>
   His star trek
   <br/>
   Will go on forever.
   <br/>
   But tell him
   <br/>
   While he wanders his starry sea
   <br/>
   Remember, remember me.
  </br>
 </p>
