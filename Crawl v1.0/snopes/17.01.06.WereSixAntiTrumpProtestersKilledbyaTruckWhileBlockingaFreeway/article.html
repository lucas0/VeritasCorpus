  On 4 January 2017 the Seattle Tribune web site published an
  <a href="http://archive.is/WaIrX/image" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  reporting that six individuals protesting the election of Donald Trump were killed in the course of blocking a freeway:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A 32-year old man driving a Waldrum Brother’s delivery truck is responsible for the death of 6 Anti-Trump protesters that were blocking traffic while chanting “Dump Trump” in the middle of a Seattle freeway.
  </p>
  <p>
   The accident occurred near an I-15 off-ramp today around 5:15 PM. According to witnesses, a crowd of approximately 16 individuals pulled their vehicles to the side of the freeway and created a barricade by linking their arms together.
  </p>
  <p>
   The protester’s actions immediately hindered the flow of traffic and motorists became upset at what many of them viewed as an unwanted obstacle preventing them from getting home after a long day at work.
