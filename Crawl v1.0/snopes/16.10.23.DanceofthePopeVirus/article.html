  In early April 2015, several rumors warning mobile phone users of a malware attachment known as the Dance of the Pope (later Dance of the Hillary) began to circulate. Many versions claimed the Dance of the Pope was an infected attachment (often a GIF or video), and that users who opened the file using services such as BlackBerry Messenger or WhatsApp risked the loss of all their cell phone data.

  A common thread in the rumors was its source: most claimed the Dance of the Pope virus was reported on the radio. Although most mentioned that the virus was discussed on the radio, none said that the posters themselves had heard it. Folks spreading the rumor believed others had heard about the virus on the radio; but none of the major versions involved the person spreading the rumor having personally listened to a news report.

  We found no information suggesting the Dance of the Pope virus warning was anything but a rumor. No radio stations were linked to the purported announcement; no news outlets reported the story; none of the antivirus companies had heard of it; and, most tellingly, no one appeared to have experienced the virus on his own device. If the virus were real, many users would have encountered and unwittingly opened the attachment despite the circulating warning by now.
