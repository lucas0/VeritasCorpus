  However, repeated efforts by the Minnesota media to unearth any vaguely similar real life case have proved entirely unsuccessful — and suspicions that this could be another coy artifice from the Coen brothers are heightened by Ethan Coen’s introduction to the published screenplay of
  <em>
   Fargo
  </em>
  (Faber and Faber, £7.99 in UK), which concludes that the movie “aims to be homey and exotic, and pretends to be true.”

  All movies are in some way fiction, so what does it matter? The Coen brothers’
  <i>
   Fargo
  </i>
  claimed to be based on a true story, and they admit it wasn’t; the “true story” bit at the beginning was just a stylistic device.”

  <em>
   Fargo
  </em>
  is a comedy-thriller about a wacky kidnapping scheme that goes incredibly wrong. The brothers originally said it was based on a true story, but a
  <em>
   New York Post
  </em>
  “investigation” got the brothers to admit the story actually popped out of their heads.
