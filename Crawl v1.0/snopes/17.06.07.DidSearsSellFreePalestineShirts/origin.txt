  We are shocked and disappointed by the politicization of the Sears brand in promoting and selling this line of apparel. This ploy is a gross exploitation of the retailer, with a presence in thousands of communities across the country, to promote a political agenda. It is also insidious in its trivialization of the reality on the ground.
