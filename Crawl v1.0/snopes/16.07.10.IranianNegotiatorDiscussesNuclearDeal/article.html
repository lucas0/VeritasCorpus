  Unsurprisingly, many viewers were fooled by the video and believed it actually showed the Iranians’ reaction to President Obama’s efforts to conclude a

  with Iran limiting that country’s nuclear ability in return for lifting international oil and financial sanctions against them.

  In this case, the “Iranian negotiator” shown in the clip is neither Iranian nor a negtiator: he’s actually Spanish comic

   He became recognizable for his giggling, which gave him the nickname “El Risitas” (translated as “The Giggles” from Spanish). He also appears in the cast of the 2005 film
