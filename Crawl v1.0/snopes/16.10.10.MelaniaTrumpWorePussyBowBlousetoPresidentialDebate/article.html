  After the conclusion of the second presidential debate held at Washington University in St. Louis on 9 October 2016, multiple fashionistas identified the fuchsia blouse worn by Melania Trump at that event as an $1,100 silk
  <em>
   crepe de chine
  </em>
  creation by the fashion giant, Gucci — a style of blouse known as a “pussy bow” (supposedly because the bow at the throat resembles ones commonly tied around cats’ necks).

  And as
  <em>
   Mashable
  </em>
  (and others) pointed out, the choice of blouse may have been poorly-timed, given that an audio tape of Donald Trump’s talking in lewd terms about women had been leaked just days earlier:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The wardrobe selection comes only two days after a 2005 video showed Donald Trump saying, “Grab them by the pussy” when referring to women he predatorily pursued.
  </p>
  <p>
   Melania’s choice of clothing was in all likelihood a total coincidence. (Or a soon-to-be-fired stylist is smirking somewhere.) The style is a common accoutrement on women’s blouses, and one favored by the likes of former U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and legendary designer Coco Chanel.

   Coincidence? Trolling IRL? You decide, America.
