  This is really scary, I’m a member in a lot of different groups from cars and trucks to Bernie Sanders even Hillary or Trump groups on Facebook. I use them all to promote Bernie, trying to change 1 mind a day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Today I was talking to a Hillary supporter within a group called “Hillary VS Bernie”. It was a very good conversation that lasted over 2 hours with a total of 86 comments. The Hillary supporters main subject was about how Hillary “Tells The Truth”. I was trying to explain to her how Hillary lies over and over. She then turned the subject into saying “So does everyone even Bernie”
 </p>
 <p>
  After about an hour of asking her to show any REAL proof of Bernie lying she gave up and said “Look it up your self” and “I don’t have time for you”. (These statements come after 2 hours of conversation).
 </p>
 <p>
  My last comment was going to be, “Clearly you can’t post any proof nor can I because he never lies”.
