  In July 2016, a the web site
  <em>
   WTOE 5 News
  </em>
  reported that Pope Francis had broken with tradition and unequivocally endorsed Donald Trump for President of the United State
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   News outlets around the world are reporting on the news that Pope Francis has made the unprecedented decision to endorse a US presidential candidate. His statement in support of Donald Trump was released from the Vatican this evening:
  </p>
  <p>
   “I have been hesitant to offer any kind of support for either candidate in the US presidential election but I now feel that to not voice my concern would be a dereliction of my duty as the Holy See.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  There was no truth to this story, however.  Although
  <em>
   WTOE 5 News
  </em>
  proclaimed that “news outlets around the world” were reporting on the Pope’s unprecedented endorsement, no reputable news publications confirmed it, because
  <em>
   WTOE 5 News
  </em>
  is one of many fake news sites that masquerade as local television news outlets and do not publish factual stories:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   WTOE 5 News is a fantasy news website.  Most articles on wtoe5news.com are satire or pure fantasy.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  This is at least the second time a “satire” news article claimed that Pope Francis had offered an endorsement of a candidate during the 2016 presidential election. In October 2015, another fake news web site
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/pope-francis-endorses-bernie-sanders/" target="_blank">
   reported
  </a>
  that the Pope had endorsed Democratic contender Bernie Sanders.  That story was also a hoax.
