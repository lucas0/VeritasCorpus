  During a townhall meeting in Laos, President Barack Obama called Americans “lazy” multiple times.
 </p>
 <p>
  For one, Obama said Americans’ reluctance to embrace his favored environmental policies is a sign of laziness.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Usually when you see the environment destroyed, it’s not because it’s necessary for development,” Obama said. “It’s usually because we’re being lazy and we’re not being as creative as we could be about how to do it in a smarter, more sustainable way.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He also accused Americans of being isolated and ignorant because the United States is such a big country.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The United States is and can be a great force for good in the world. But because we’re such a big country, we haven’t always had to know about other parts of the world,” he said. “If you’re in the United States, sometimes you can feel lazy and think we’re so big we don’t have to really know anything about other people.”
