  A purported quote about the business advantage of being an atheist from Donald Trump’s 1987 book
  <em>
   The Art of the Deal
  </em>
  has been
  <a href="https://twitter.com/9BlackCats/status/860204283114905601" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   circulating
  </a>
  as a meme since at least May 2017:

   “Being an atheist gives me an edge in every deal. Christians are too moral for business.”

  and found no incidence of these sentences — or even the word “atheist.” In fact, Trump’s book is practically void of religious mentions (it is, after all, a business book).

 <p>
  Although the
  <em>
   Art of the Deal
  </em>
  quote is fake, the
  <em>
   New York Times
  </em>
  quote in this meme is real and appears on the cover of some
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trump-Art-Deal-Donald-J/dp/0399594493" target="_blank">
   editions
  </a>
  of the book. On 7 December 1987, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt ended his

  of
  <em>
   The Art of the Deal
  </em>
  by saying that “Mr. Trump makes one believe for a moment in the American dream again.” However, the meme excludes the next sentence: “It’s like a fairy tale.”

 <p>
  A similar rumor holding that Trump identified himself as an atheist spread during the 2016 presidential election. In that case, the rumor was that Trump had bragged on
  <em>
   The Phil Donahue Show
  </em>
  in 1989 that his “impossibly high I.Q.” made it impossible for him to not be an atheist. We found that quote to be
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/trump-donahue-atheist-1989/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   fake
  </a>
  as well.
