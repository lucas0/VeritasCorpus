  On 21 February 2016,
  <em>
   Newslo
  </em>
  published an article reporting that Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio said he is against abortion even if  “God were to intentionally infect a baby in the womb with the Zika virus”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   During a weekend interview, CNN challenged pro-life Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio on his statement during last week’s Republican debate about posing abortion in cases of rape or incest. The Florida senator didn’t back down from his pro-life position. Host George Stephanopoulos said, “You also got called out by Jeb Bush and Chris Christie on the issue of abortion because you don’t support exceptions for rape and incest.” Rubio replied, “Well, first of all, I do require an exception for the life of the mother because I’m pro-life. Number two, I – as I’ve said, if they pass a law in Congress that has exceptions, I’ll sign it because I want to save lives. The broader point I’ve made, however, is I believe all human life is worthy of the protection of our laws.”
  </p>
  <p>
   … Rubio continued, “What I’m trying to say here is that God created all of us in His image for a reason, and despite the selfishness that is raging through the majority of our population, I believe He put us humans on this Earth to protect and preserve life, not to kill it before it’s even had a chance to start. We are committing murder and we are going to go to Hell for it. And let me just add, I do not believe – let me say that again: I DO NOT believe in abortion, because that’s equal to murder in my book. If God were to intentionally infect a baby in the womb with the Zika virus, for example – I would still forbid the mother to have an abortion and use it to avoid God’s judgment. That’s how adamant I am when it comes to people’s right to freedom and existence.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  The quoted material in the first paragraph was actually legitimate, which caused further confusion.  It came from Rubio’s 7 February 2016 appearance on
  <em>
   This Week
  </em>
  with George Stephanopoulos, during which he discussed his opposition to abortion:

  However, that was the only paragraph that wasn’t embellished, as indicated by
