  Among the many epidemiological trends blamed on vaccines, one of the lesser known fallacies is that they are the cause of an increased incidence of childhood peanut allergies in the United States and other nations.

 <p class="p1">
  Though articles and individuals attempting to make this link propose a variety of mechanisms for the ways in which an inoculation could contribute to the development of peanut allergies, each relies on the false premise that vaccines (childhood and/or influenza) contain undisclosed traces of peanut oil.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  The most common narrative found online is that peanut oil is used as what is known as an adjuvant (a chemical that increases the body’s immune response to an inoculation) but loopholes in the legal system allow this information to remain undisclosed.

 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   Many different substances have been used as adjuvants over the last 100 years, and the scientists have been constantly on the lookout for more dangerous substances which produce extreme immune reactions in the human body, until one day they stumbled upon a substance that delivered the kind of deadly reaction they were looking for: Peanuts.
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   Peanuts were first used as an adjuvant in vaccines in the mid-60s. We know this because the startling admission was made in the New York Times on 18 Sep 1964, where the author described how a newly patented ingredient including peanut oil was being added to the flu vaccine as an adjuvant in order to ‘enhance the vaccines strength’. Peanut oil became the model for subsequent vaccines, and by the 1980s it had become the preferred adjuvant for the manufacturers.
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   Today, peanut oil is a common trade secret ingredient used in vaccine adjuvants. They claim it as a trade secret so their competitors wont [sic] ‘steal their vaccine formulas’, but in reality they do it so they don’t have to list it as an ingredient, in the hope that the unaware public wont realise it is the cause.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  While the Vaccine Information Network post is a bit more dramatic in its language, both that post and the book from which that information is derived make a number of claims that require investigation:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="p1">
   Peanuts (or peanut oil) were used in vaccines that were given to the general public starting in the mid-1960s.
  </li>
  <li class="p1">

  about a clinical trial conducted by the pharmaceutical company Merck of a flu vaccine that contained a new peanut-oil based adjuvant given the name “Adjuvant 65”, which at the time seemed to show considerable promise:
 </p>

 <p class="p1">
  This article, however, in no way demonstrates that vaccines commonly contained peanut-oil adjuvants in the 1960s; In fact, it makes it clear that they were not even approved for public use in the United States, explicitly stating “the new vaccine is still under study and is not yet licensed for general use.”

  from 1966. Here, crucially, Fraser says that in 1966, “Merck introduced this novel peanut oil additive to the public in a flu vaccine”, implying the product was approved for public use. The only problem is the story she cited concerns a conference presentation by the same researchers in the 1964 study, and it once again makes it clear that it is
  <em>
   not
  </em>
  a publicly available concoction, but instead still undergoing testing:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   Studies of an additive to an influenza vaccine show that it increases the potency and duration of the vaccine’s protective effect. This was reported today at an international conference on vaccines here that is sponsored by the World Health Organization and the Pan-American Health Organization.
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   The additive — called an adjuvant — has been tested on 15,000 adults and children. To date, the studies suggest that use of the adjuvant produces a high level of immunity that lasts for several years. Ordinarily, it is believed that flu vaccine produced from a killed virus produces an immunity that is likely to last only one season.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  When asked for clarification, Fraser told us via email that she did not intend to suggest that Adjuvant 65 was ever used in American vaccines:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   Adjuvant 65-4 [the specific formulation tested then] was never licensed for use in the US. It was used in vaccines in clinical trials, some large scale over a period of at least 10 years. I did not mean to suggest that this adjuvant was used outside of clinical trials in the US.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  Intent or not, it appears likely that many anti-vaccine websites have taken these two citations as proof that Adjuvant 65, or some peanut oil containing progeny, is and remains a commonly used ingredient in vaccines. In reality, however, Adjuvant 65 was never approved for use in the United States and many other countries due to

   Peanut Oil “Became a Model” for Subsequent Adjuvants in Vaccines — False

 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  This wording is vague as it does not define what “became a model” actually means. One thing it does not mean, however, is that the failure of Adjuvant 65 resulted in a number of other more successful and widely used peanut based vaccine adjuvants, as there has not been a single such product licensed for use in human vaccines.

   <span class="s1">
    1993 review
   </span>
  </a>
  of the topic, which describes the efforts to create vegetable oil adjuvants (which can be metabolized by the body) as a replacement for mineral oil adjuvants (which, because they cannot, lead to health concerns):
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   Various kinds of emulsions with different oil samples have been evaluated in a search for a stable, non-toxic and better adjuvant. As an alternative to mineral oil emulsion adjuvants, [the research group associated with Merck] designed a vegetable oil adjuvant, ‘Adjuvant 65’, consisting of 86% peanut oil, 10% Arlacel A […] as emulsifier and 4% aluminium monostearate as stabilizer […].
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   When tried in humans, this adjuvant appeared to be safe and potent but with less adjuvanticity than [the most common mineral oil adjuvant]. Although Adjuvant 65 was licensed for general use in one country, its use was discontinued due to reactogenicity for man […]
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   Despite the absence of tumour formation in […] several thousand persons inoculated with Adjuvant 65 influenza vaccine followed for 10 years, further work on these adjuvants of vegetable oil with Arlacel A slowed down or even stopped when it was shown in one report that Arlacel A [might be carcinogenic in one strain of lab mice]. […]
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   [One research group] developed an adjuvant with sesame oil double emulsion without Arlacel A which could be metabolized. This preparation had a good adjuvant effect on the antibody response of mice. Another preparation containing highly refined peanut oil emulsified in aqueous arbovirus vaccine with glycerol and lecithin increased antibody production and induced protective immunity in several experimental animals. Unlike Arlacel A, glycerol and lecithin are readily metabolized normal host constituents. This formula of peanut oil, glycerol and lecithin has been described as relatively non-reactogenic in tissues.
   <b>
    However [as of 1993], there is still no oil emulsion adjuvant which may be used in humans.
   </b>
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  In her book, Fraser cites a single research paper testing a peanut-oil based adjuvant in a variety of animal models, as well as a handful of patent applications, to defend the claim that it was “a model” for other adjuvants at the time.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  While it is unclear what became of that particular adjuvant in that study, no peanut-oil adjuvant has ever been licensed for use in American vaccines, meaning it likely didn’t go anywhere. At least one of the patents Fraser cites, incidentally, certainly didn’t go anywhere — it is currently listed as
  <a href="http://archive.is/HHLDZ" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    expired
   </span>

  because of lack of payment for administrative fees. Far from being a model for new adjuvants, peanut oil could more accurately be described as a dead end.

  This claim, incidentally, is not made in Fraser’s book, but is included on the VaccineInformationNetwork.com post, and may stem from a misreading of her statement that the inclusion of peanut oil in vaccine adjuvant patents became “common practice”.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Regardless of the relative meaninglessness of the term “common practice” in this context (or the irrelevance of a patent application to a larger discussion of epidemiological trends) claiming that peanut oil was a preferred adjuvant for vaccines by the 1980s is about as “alternative fact” as they come. As discussed above, efforts to develop vegetable oil based adjuvants essentially stopped in the late 1970s. There are, currently,

 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   However, with the sharp rise in lawsuits against vaccine makers starting in the mid-1970s, public knowledge of exact ingredients in vaccines or other pediatric injections became circumscribed. Vaccine makers no longer excitedly announced new ingredients as Merck did in 1964 with the peanut-oil-based Adjuvant 65-4. The public had no way of knowing fully what was being injected into their children.

  By asserting that “peanut oil has been used in vaccines since the 1960s” — a reference to the previously mentioned trial study —
  <em>

  may be conflating adjuvants with growth media. A “growth medium” is simply a concoction of nutrients, sugars and other hydrocarbons that help either bacterial cells or cells hosting a virus to survive. In a post explaining why animal products are sometimes used to achieve this goal, the Food and Drug Administration
  <a href="http://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/vaccines/questionsaboutvaccines/ucm143521.htm#anivac" target="_blank">

  the basics:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   Vaccines contain either killed or weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses, or components of these that stimulate a response by the body’s immune system, which then protects against the development of disease. In the late 19th century, microbiologists began to grow bacteria in the laboratory. The early bacteriologists tried to mimic as closely as possible the environment in an infected person’s tissues by using solutions containing sugars, salts, and various meat extracts to make “growth media.” These kinds of conditions were quite successful in growing bacteria and then viruses in the lab, because these media supplied the many necessary nutrients. Although synthetic media have been developed for growth of many medically important microorganisms, some still require additional nutrients which are easily provided by animal-derived products such as serum and blood. Viral vaccines are produced in living cells, which, similarly, require the addition of complex growth media components, such as fetal calf serum.

   The Bottom Line

 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Despite all of the above hoops one must jump through to debunk this myth, the basic facts are quite simple. Arguments suggesting that peanut oil is present in vaccines of any kind rely on using a clinical trial for a peanut-oil based adjuvant in the 1960s as evidence that peanut oil adjuvants are and have been in widespread use.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Those trials were a failure. No peanut oil based adjuvants (or growth media) are used in human vaccines, and there are no legal loopholes (at least in the United States) that would allow pharmaceutical companies to avoid disclosure of different compounds used in their production. In response to our inquiry about the claims made in her book, Fraser told us:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   While the oil has a history of use in pharmaceuticals, I have no evidence that it is used in childhood vaccines.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  Despite this, Fraser’s book is still often offered as the definitive source for the “fact” that childhood vaccines (or flu shots) contain peanut oil.
