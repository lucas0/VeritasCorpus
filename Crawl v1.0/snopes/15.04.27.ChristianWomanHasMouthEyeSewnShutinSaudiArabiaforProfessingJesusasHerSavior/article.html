  In April 2014 several blogs published the above displayed photograph depicting an unidentified woman with injuries of an indeterminate origin. At the time of its April 2014 circulation, the photograph was described as documenting of the persecution of Christians in Saudi Arabia;  one iteration titled “See the Unforgivable Thing Muslims Did to This Girl Because She Believes in Jesus”
  <a href="http://www.donotlink.com/ew71" target="_blank">
   reported
  </a>
  that the woman’s eye and mouth had been sewn shut as punishment because she proclaimed herself to be a Christian:

  <p>
   A young woman working in Saudi Arabia had her eye sewn shut this weekend after she proclaimed that she was a Christian.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sharia law in Saudi Arabia outlaws any speech that dissents from Islam. The woman proclaimed, “Jesus is my
   <nobr>
    savior” — a
   </nobr>
   phrase that’s considered abominable in Saudi Arabia.
  </p>
  <p>
   President Obama has chosen to stay neutral from this issue, but these Christians need a voice.
