  reproduced above, reporting that she and her children were followed and harassed by three Muslim men at Kiroli Park in West Monroe, Louisiana.

  According to the woman’s claim, the incident occurred on 26 June 2016 when three Muslim men “[followed the family] through the park,” asking invasive questions and offering to take her daughters “back to Yemen.” The woman maintained that both the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agents were “involved on site,” but that the three men involved were only banned from the park and not arrested. She cautioned locals to be “aware” and mindful of their children in the wake of her experience.

  We contacted police in West Monroe to corroborate the claims, and an officer there told us that the department would be issuing a brief on 28 June 2016.

  Meanwhile, the department issued a press release addressing the rumors, stating that local police (but not the FBI or DHS) had investigated two separate incidents at the park occurring about the same time: one in which a mother with four children were approached by a man who “asked personal and inappropriate questions” while two other men took pictures with a cell phone; and one in which one of the same men “asked personal and inappropriate questions” of another adult woman.  The men were not arrested because they had not violated any laws, but they were “banned from the park”:

A local news outlet also <a href="http://www.knoe.com/content/news/Three-individuals-banned-from-Kiroli-Park-following-reported-harrassment-384715891.html" target="_blank">reported</A> on the incident but also didn't mention the presence of the FBI or DHS:



<blockquote>On Sunday, June 26, 2016, the West Monroe Police Department responded to a complaint at Kiroli Park in reference to harassment. The investigation led to two separate incidents that occurred around the same time.

In the first incident, a mother and four children were approached by a male who asked personal and inappropriate questions. While this occurred, two other males took pictures with a cell phone.

In the second incident involving the same suspects, an adult female was exiting a trail when contacted by one of the males who also asked personal and inappropriate questions.

Kiroli Park has a resident officer who was on scene and was able to locate and question the males. No arrests were made because the actions of the suspects involved do not fall under any Louisiana statute. However, the West Monroe Police Department takes these encounters seriously. The following actions were taken: all three suspects were identified, photographed, and banned from the park. Kiroli staff, the park director, the Mayor’s Office and all local, state, and federal agencies were made aware of the incident and of the suspects involved.</blockquote>



Per that account, an officer on park patrol logged the incident and banned the men from Kiroli Park; state and federal agencies were notified. However, the outlet didn't describe the men as "Muslim" and didn't state federal agencies were actively investigating the incident. Police in West Monroe had yet to make a formal statement on the claims.
