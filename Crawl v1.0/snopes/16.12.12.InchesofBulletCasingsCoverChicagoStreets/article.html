  a satirical article reporting that the city of Chicago had sent out snowplows to clear more than eighteen inches of bullet casings from the streets:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Promising that every effort would be made to limit the impact on residents’ day-to-day lives, Chicago officials announced Wednesday that a fleet of plows was working around the clock to clear more than 18 inches of fresh bullet casings that had blanketed the metropolitan area overnight.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sources at the city’s Department of Streets and Sanitation confirmed that over 250 ammunition-removal vehicles had been deployed to deal with the knee-deep layer of spent cartridges, which have been steadily accumulating on Chicago’s streets, alleys, and pedestrian walkways since the previous evening.

  <em>
   The Onion
  </em>
  is a well-known purveyor of satirical stories, but some people, unfamiliar with the site, mistook it for a genuine news item. However, it contains little truth. While there is an issue of

   violent crime
  </a>
  in Chicago, the city does not employ “ammunition removal vehicles” to clear the streets of bullet casings.
