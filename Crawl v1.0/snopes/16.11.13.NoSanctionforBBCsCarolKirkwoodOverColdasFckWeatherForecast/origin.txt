 <p>
  The BBC has announced that there will be no punishment for popular weather presenter Carol Kirkwood’s use of the phrase ‘cold as f*ck.’
 </p>
 <p>
  She used the phrase during an outside broadcast on a hill in the North York Moors on Friday morning in response to a question from colleague Bill Turnbill.
 </p>
 <p>
  “And now to Carol for the weather,” said the avuncular bee-keeper.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Carol, it looks a bit chilly where you are?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “That’s right Billy,” she responded chirpily.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s cold as fuck.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I’m sorry?” replied a visibly shocked Turnbill.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Cold. As. Fuck.” She repeated, forcefully.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Bastard cold. Shitting cold. Cold as an eskimo’s arse. Cold as a witch’s tit. Cold enough to worry any brass monkeys. It is abso-fucking-lutely fucking cold as fucking fuck.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The BBC has issued a statement saying there would be no sanction for Miss Kirkwood because “after investigation we have discovered that on the North York Moors on Friday morning, it was indeed cold as f*ck.”
