   I am disgusted with ” President” Trump allowing people to keep more of the money they earn.   It is this type of wide spread theft of public resources that keeps America from being great ” Mr. President”.

  The House Minority Leader did legitimately post criticism of the tax reform bill, repeatedly calling it a “GOP Tax Scam” and saying that that the bill would explode the deficit, and noted that 86 million middle class families would see a tax hike:

  The House Minority Leader also appeared to take as much issue with how the legislation was passed as she did with was what it contains. The following message was pinned to the top of her Twitter timeline:

  The criticisms levied by Pelosi are backed by reports from nonpartisan organizations such as the Tax Policy Center and Congress’s own Joint Committee on Taxation. We wrote about these claims (and several others) in an
