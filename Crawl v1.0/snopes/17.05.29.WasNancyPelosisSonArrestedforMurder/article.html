  On 27 May 2017, repeat offender TheLastLineOfDefense.org posted an
  <a href="http://thelastlineofdefense.org/nancy-pelosis-son-arrested-for-murder/" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  in which it was claimed that one Johnathon Pelosi, allegedly the son of U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, was arrested for murder:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s son, Johnathon, was booked into the Orange County jail on charges that he murdered his daughter’s boyfriend’s stepfather during a dispute over a rule in a little league baseball game. Johnathon, 42, believed that a tie went to the runner when Stefan Alberts, 31, told him that there is no tie, the umpire uses his judgment.
  </p>
  <p>
   That’s when a full fisticuffs broke out and Alberts ended up on the ground beaten so badly with a 29″ Louisville Slugger Aluminum that paramedics had no chance to save his life. Johnathon said he was within his rights to defend himself after Alberts took a swing but witnesses on site told reporters that Johnathon walked calmly to the dugout, grabbed a bat, walked up behind Alberts and bashed him over the head like he was Glen.

 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The story was fabricated. According to Biography.com,
  <a href="https://www.biography.com/people/nancy-pelosi-38487" target="_blank">
   Nancy Pelosi
  </a>
  has five children, including one son named Paul. She does not have a son named “Johnathon.”

  Last Line of Defense is a “satirical” web site that churns out

   fake news
  </a>
  about American politics on a daily, if not hourly, basis. Other LLOD reports published in early 2017 falsely claimed that the

   body
  </a>
  of a tortured, malnourished woman was found on the Clinton estate and that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had “
