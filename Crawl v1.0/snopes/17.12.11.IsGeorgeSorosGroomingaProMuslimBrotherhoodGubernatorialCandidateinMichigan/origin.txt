  Don’t ever say you weren’t warned-‘He IS on his way’
  <br>
   ‘He IS being groomed at this very minute’
   <br/>
   PRESIDENT ABDUL EL-SAYED?
   <br/>
   Etch this man’s name in your mind.
   <br/>
   His name is Abdul El-Sayed.
   <br/>
   After years of being groomed by George Soros. He has been hand-picked by the Left to be their next “champion” of Hope and Change.
   <br/>
   He is 32 years old, born in the USA, and an extremely well educated Muslim Doctor in Detroit Michigan. (education funded by Soros)
   <br/>
   He is handsome, articulate, charismatic and smart.
   <br/>
   He is sympathetic of the Muslim Brotherhood, and is running for Governor of Michigan,
   <br/>
   Which is Step 1 in his preparation to run for President of the United States
   <br/>
   He has the potential to be Obama #2, but far more openly Muslim.
   <br/>
   Abdulrahman Mohamed El-Sayed is an American physician, epidemiologist, public health advocate, and politician.
   <br/>
   He has announced his candidacy for Governor of Michigan, running as a Democrat.

   In 2020 he will be eligible to run for President!
   <br/>
   Democrats’ mouths are watering in anticipation and raising money.
   <br/>
   Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren is already campaigning for him. Another Trojan Horse?
   <br/>
   Al Jazeera, which is widely read by Michigan’s large Muslim population is doing its best to help George make him “YOUR” president in 2020!
   <br/>
   Bet you never dreamed an unknown, like Obama, would end up as the President of the United States of America FOR 8 YEARS, did you?
   <br/>
