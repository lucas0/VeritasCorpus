  OH CANADA – OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM
 </p>
 <p>
  Boy do I ever agree with this one — Keep it the way it was written — English period, no exceptions!!!!!!
 </p>
 <p>
  I am sorry but after hearing they want to sing the National Anthem in Hindi – enough is enough. No where did they sing it
  <br>
   in Italian, Japanese, Polish, Irish (Celtic), German, Portuguese, Greek, or any other language because of immigration. It was written in English, and should be sung word for word the way it was written.
  </br>
 </p>
 <p>
  If this offends anyone too bad – because this is MY COUNTRY!!! – IF IT IS YOUR COUNTRY, SPEAK UP — please pass this along.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am not against immigration — just come through like everyone else. Get a sponsor; have a place to lay your head; have a job; pay your taxes, live by the rules AND LEARN THE LANGUAGE as all other immigrants have in the past — and LONG LIVE CANADA!
 </p>
 <p>
  PART OF THE PROBLEM
 </p>
 <p>
  Think about this: If you don’t want to forward this for fear of offending someone — YOU’RE PART OF THE PROBLEM !!!!
 </p>
 <p>
  Will we still be the Country of choice and still be CANADA if we continue to make the changes forced on us by the people
  <br/>
  from other countries that came to live in CANADA because it is the Country of Choice??????
 </p>
 <p>
  Think about it!
 </p>
 <p>
  IMMIGRANTS, NOT CANADIAN’S, MUST ADAPT.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is Time for CANADIANS to Speak up. If you agree — pass this along; if you don’t agree — delete it!

  Yep! I am passing it on..

  I am sorry but after hearing they want to sing the National Anthem in Spanish – enough is enough. No where did they sing it in Italian, Japanese, Polish, Irish (Celtic), German, Portuguese, Greek, French, or any other language because of immigration. It was written by Robert Stanley Weir and should be sung word for word the way it was written. The news broadcasts even gave the translation — not even close. Sorry if this offends anyone but this is MY COUNTRY — IF IT IS YOUR COUNTRY SPEAK UP — please pass this along.

No, where did they sing it in Italian, Japanese, Polish, Irish (Celtic), Chinese, Portuguese, Greek, French, or any other language because of immigration. It was written by Francis Scott Key and should be sung word for word the way it was written. The news broadcasts even gave the translation — not even close.

  PART OF THE PROBLEM
 </p>
 <p>
  Think about this: If you don’t want to forward this for fear of offending someone — YOU’RE PART OF THE PROBLEM!!!! Will we still be the Country of choice and still be America if we continue to make the changes forced on us by the people from other countries that came to live in America because it is the Country of Choice??????

  Think about it! All we have to say is, when will they do something about MY RIGHTS? We’ve gone so far the other way, bent over backwards to not offend anyone, that I am now being offended. But it seems that no one has a problem with that. This says it all! This is an editorial written by an American citizen, published in a Tampa newspaper. He did quite a job; didn’t he? Read on, please!
 </p>
 <p>
  IMMIGRANTS, NOT AMERICANS, MUST ADAPT. I am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their culture. Since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of Americans. However… The dust from the attacks had barely settled when the “politically correct!” crowd began complaining about the possibility that our patriotism was offending others. I am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is seeking a better life by coming to America. Our population is almost entirely made up of descendants of immigrants. However, there are a few things that those who have recently come to our country, and apparently some born here, need to understand. This idea of America being a multicultural community has served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity. As Americans… we have our own culture, our own society, our own language and our own lifestyle. This culture has been developed over centuries of struggles, trials, and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom.
 </p>
 <p>
  We speak ENGLISH, not Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Greek, Polish, Italian, French, or any other language. Therefore, if you wish to become part of our society, learn the language!
 </p>
 <p>
  “In God We Trust” is our national motto. This is not some Christian, right wing, political slogan. We adopted this motto because Christian men and women… on Christian principles… Founded this nation… And this is clearly documented. It is
  <br/>
  certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools. If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home… because God is part of our culture. If Stars and Stripes offend you, or you don’t like Uncle Sam, then you should seriously consider a move to another part of this planet. We are happy with our culture and have no desire to change, and we really don’t care how you did things where you came from. This is OUR COUNTRY, our land, and our lifestyle. Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his opinion and we will allow you every opportunity to do so! But once you are done complaining… Whining… And griping… about our flag… our pledge… our national motto… or our way of life… I highly encourage you to take advantage of one other Great American Freedom…
 </p>
 <p>
  THE RIGHT TO LEAVE.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is Time for America to Speak up. If you agree — pass this along; if you don’t agree — delete it.
