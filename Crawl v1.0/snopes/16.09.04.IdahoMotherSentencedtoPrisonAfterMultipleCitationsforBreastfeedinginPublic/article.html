  On 3 September 2016, the disreputable web site
  <em>
   Associated Media Coverage
  </em>
  published a hoax news article that reported an Idaho woman named Heather Watson had been sentenced prison for breastfeeding in public:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Heather Watson, a 32-year old mother and Baker County, Idaho, resident has been ordered to serve a 7-year prison sentence after receiving several indecent exposure citations for breastfeeding her 6 -month old daughter in public.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to Heather’s husband, Rick Watson, his wife had received a total of 6 indecent exposure citations for breastfeeding their daughter Caylee in public. Heather most recently was arrested by officers at a nearby public park. According to police reports and statements from Watson, she had been sitting on bench supervising her 3 other children, age 2, 5, and 7, as they played with other children at the park when her baby become fussy and needed to be fed.

  While
  <em>
   Associated Media Coverage
  </em>
  does not carry a disclaimer labeling its content as fiction, this web site is a known purveyor of hoax stories, previously incorrectly reporting that an Oregon elementary school had
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/oregon-school-bans-pledge-of-allegiance/" target="_blank">
   banned
  </a>
  the Pledge of Allegiance, that a dead baby was

  in a Walmart bin, and that eleven states had placed a

  </a>
  on motorcyclists.

 <p>
  Additionally, the official web site of the state of
  <a href="http://www.idaho.gov/aboutidaho/county/index.html" target="_blank">
   Idaho
  </a>
  does not list a “Baker County.”  While the story ends with a call for readers to contact the “Baker County Department of Justice” to complain -— (785) 273-0325 — belongs to the Westboro Baptist Church in Kansas, not a police department in Idaho.
