  [V]itamin B12 concentrations in the blood were significantly lower in patients with PE than the subjects without PE (p &lt; .0001)â€¦. Moreover, the vitamin B12 levels correlated positively with [intravaginal ejaculation latency time] IELT values and correlated negatively with [premature ejaculation diagnostic tool] PEDT scores. This work has also demonstrated that plasma vitamin B12 levels in patients with PE showed an increasing trend with decreasing PE severity.
