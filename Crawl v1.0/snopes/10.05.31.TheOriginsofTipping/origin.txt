  Excuse me, but isn’t that the entire point of the whole tipping system? Isn’t that exactly why tips To Insure Promptness evolved in the first place?

  Well you know, TIP is an acronym for “To Insure Performance” and was originally administered before the meal. You give a good tip, and that ensured that your tea/water/beer was always full.

  By the way, did you know where the word tip came from? It was common in English pubs several hundred years ago to have a box next to the door, with the initials, T.I.P.S., which stood for ‘To Insure Prompt Service’.
