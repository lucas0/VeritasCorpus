  All the components are taken on a scanning electron microscope and then coloured in Photoshop as electron microscopes use electrons to form images not light so are always B&amp;W. The blood cell on the tip of a needle is a composition of images at very different magnifications put together to simply make an interesting image with no desire to deceive or cause controversy. All my images are authentic in that they are real images of real objects. The attached shows a concept for bone marrow transplantation and is a similar composition to illustrate a visual idea. Hope you can post this and people continue to discuss my work, always happy to answer sensible questions. Regards Steve Gschmeissner
