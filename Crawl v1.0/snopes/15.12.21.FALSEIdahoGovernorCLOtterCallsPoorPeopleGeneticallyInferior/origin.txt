  A former Butch Otter staffer leaked a partial audio transcript she secretly recorded at an informal meeting Otter held with his Chief of Staff and the Director of the Idaho Department of Health &amp; Welfare. The lurid, rambling transcript reveals a Nazi-esque attitude toward Idaho’s poor.

   “Look, I hear that … David and I debate this … but the big difference between the rich and the poor … it’s genetics. Poor people are genetically inferior, but that’s okay … [unintelligible] Don’t jump my roost about it … I didn’t make up that fact. It’s going to have to be okay, because it’s not like we can kill them [laughter from Otter]. But we need to stop spending … you know, spending so much on the inferior … It’s going to raise taxes, hurt [the] economy, if we don’t. [unintelligible] Poor people deserve to live. I’m not heartless … [unintelligible] strict guidelines. Thank God we have religion … [unintelligible] retail … The lesser obviously can’t take care of themselves without it. I represent the genetically inferior … [laughter from Otter].  I’m bringing them jobs … the call centers … The Kuna meat packing plant … [laughter from Otter]. Inferior need to work harder now and realize that big government isn’t here in Idaho.”
