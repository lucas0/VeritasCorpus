  Anybody voting for Bernie in New York, *please* google the phrase “passive electioneering.” New York is one of six states that has laws against passive electioneering. While it’s not always enforced, wearing Bernie pins/stickers/hats/shirts will give you trouble once you go to vote. At best, you’ll just be asked to remove the item, but at worst you could be barred from entering your polling place. Wear literally ANYTHING ELSE.
