 <p>
  City councillors in Montreal just signed a death warrant for thousands of dogs in the Canadian city.
 </p>
 <p>
  At a council meeting, legislators voted in 37 to 23 favor of breed-specific legislation, effectively outlawing any dog that resembles a pit bull — unless owners meet a strict set of conditions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Under the law, people who own dogs deemed pit bulls have until March to undergo a criminal background check and pay $150 for a special permit. Their dog will have to be sterilized, vaccinated and microchipped — as well as muzzled and on a 4-foot leash at all times in public.
 </p>

  “There are a lot of low-income and homeless people in Montreal who simply won’t be able to afford all of the criteria they need in order to get the special permit,” Devine told The Dodo. “Those dogs will have to be seized and have to be euthanized.”
