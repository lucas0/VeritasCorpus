  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, William and Kate, have been scrupulously

   careful

  in how they expose their children — George and Charlotte — to the glare of publicity, since the birth of their son in 2013.
 </p>
 <p>
  So it would come as a great surprise to learn that Prince George had appeared in a viral Facebook video, reeling off biblical verses in the form of the alphabet.

 <p>
  In an American accent.

  Nonetheless, in February 2018, Facebook user Helene K H Yap posted a

  of such a boy, and speculated about his identity: “Prince George, Prince William’s son? The grandson of Princess Diana?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The post was shared more than 400,000 times within six days. However, the video does not show Prince George of Cambridge, third

   I am so very proud of this kid. We’ve been working on this all summer, one letter a week, and every time I thought a verse was too long or complicated, he’d prove me wrong. Now the hard part…being the kind of Dad who helps him live these words.

  In an
  <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/blog/2017/01/4-year-old-recites-abcs-using-bible-verses/" target="_blank">
   interview
  </a>
  with the Bible Gateway blog, Taylor Hemness provided more details about the background to the video:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Last spring, our youth minister at Glenwood Church of Christ in Tyler, Texas, challenged families to learn a Bible verse for every letter of the alphabet. At the time, Tanner was 3-and-a-half, so I started to tune out. But the minister encouraged parents of young children to try it too, because “we’d be amazed by what they’re able to retain.”
  </p>
  <p>
   I thought it was worth a try, but honestly didn’t believe that he’d be able to do it. That thought was only strengthened when I saw the list of verses the church provided to us. “Jesus wept” isn’t on the list! I wasn’t even sure they were all from the same translation. So, that Monday, we wrote the first verse on a chalkboard in our kitchen, and started practicing with him. I’d run through it every day, and by Thursday, he had it.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following Monday, we did it again with “B,” but we also still made him recite A. So, by week five, he was doing A, B, C, D, and E every day. There were a few verses that took two weeks, thanks to difficulty, or things like family travel. Altogether, it took about six months.
  </p>
  <p>
   He’s wearing a tuxedo in the video because we were at a wedding. He was a ring bearer in a co-worker’s wedding, he was all dressed up, and he’d just learned “Z” the week prior. We had a few minutes, and a quiet room, so I took the opportunity to film him, which I’d always planned to do when he was done.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Setting aside the true origins of the viral video, a couple of points should have raised flags for anyone contemplating the possibility that it features Prince George.
 </p>
 <p>
  Firstly, although we don’t have audio evidence of the young English prince’s voice, it would be astonishing if he spoke with a Texan drawl. Secondly, Prince George has blond hair, not brown.
