  On 12 April 2007 the United States Postal Service (USPS) introduced the “

  , the concept behind Forever Stamps was that they could be purchased at the current rate for first-class postage, but they could be used to mail letters (without the need for additional postage) no matter how much postage rates might change in the future
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Postal officials pitched the idea of creating a “forever stamp” that would be good for sending First-Class mail no matter how much — or how often — the cost of a postage stamp goes up. The announcement came on the same day that the Postal Service said it would seek to raise the price of a First-Class stamp for the second consecutive year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The forever stamp, which would cost the same as a First-Class stamp, would provide a hedge against future postal rate increases and end the search for 2- or 3-cent stamps that usually follows a price increase.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  That early news coverage explained that no matter when a Forever Stamp (also known as
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-denominated_postage#Forever_stamps" target="_blank">
   non-denominated
  </a>
  postage) was purchased, it entitled the buyer to use it for first-class postage:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   If the cost of sending a First-Class letter is raised to 42 cents next year, for instance, the forever stamp would be sold for that amount. If the First-Class rate then increased by 2 cents a year or two later, forever stamps would sell for 44 cents. But forever stamps purchased at the 42-cent rate still would get a First-Class letter where it needs to go.
  </p>
  <p>
   “If you buy it, it can be used forever on single-piece First-Class letters,” said Stephen Kearney, vice president for pricing at the Postal Service.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Despite subsequent rumors that mail sent using Forever Stamps is somehow processed differently (and slower) than other mail, a USPS “Forever Stamp Fact Sheet” released at the time of the Forever Stamps’ introduction [
  <a href="http://about.usps.com/news/fact-sheets/forever-stamp-facts.pdf" target="_blank">

  ] made no mention of a separate classification or handling of letters mailed using Forever Stamp postage. A similar
  <a href="https://about.usps.com/news/fact-sheets/forever-stamp-facts.htm" target="_blank">
   document
  </a>
  found on the USPS’s web site in March 2016 reiterated that the primary difference between Forever Stamps and denominated postage was a locked-in rate. All reporting has described Forever Stamps as identical to their denominated First-Class counterparts, save for built-in protections against postal rate hikes.
 </p>
 <p>
  One aspect of such rumors holds that items sent using Forever Stamps are considered “second-class mail,” but that category (now called “
  <a href="http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/financials/annual-reports/fy2004/glossary.htm" target="_blank">
   Periodicals
  </a>
  “) applied to newspapers and magazines that were handled with a lower priority than first-class mail, not to letters and other enveloped items.
 </p>
 <p>
  This rumor might stem from the fact that recent years have seen wide
  <a href="https://www.qg.com/blog/understanding-usps-delivery-performance" target="_blank">
   fluctuations
  </a>
  in delivery times for first-class mail and slowdowns in the handling of all first-class mail. In December 2014 the USPS released a fact sheet [

  ] explaining that consolidation of mail processing facilities had led to longer transit times for first-class mail:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In the past 10 years, total volume has declined by more than 56 billion pieces (or 26%), First-Class Mail volume has declined 34.5 billion pieces (or 35%), and single-piece First Class Mail (primarily letters bearing postage stamps) has declined 24.4 billion pieces (or more than 50%).
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2015, the Postal Service changed its First-Class Mail service standards, affecting roughly 14 billion pieces of the total volume (or 9%) and up to 16% of First-Class Mail. The affected volume represents primarily single-piece First-Class Mail. The majority of this mail is being delivered in two days instead of one.
  </p>
  <p>
   Today, total First-Class Mail is delivered in an average of 2.1 days. Prior to the service standard change, First-Class Mail was delivered in an average of 1.8 days.

   reported
  </a>
  that many USPS customers were unaware of the adjusted first-class mail delivery projections despite the USPS’s ongoing efforts to notify the public about them:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Facing a dramatic decline in the mail volume, the agency announced in 2011 that it would be consolidating the processing and distribution facilities and making revisions to its First-Class Mail service standards.
  </p>
  <p>
   Those standard changes, which took place nationwide on Jan. 5, resulted in the average processing and delivery time for a piece of First-Class Mail, such as a birthday card or magazine, to increase from an average of 1-2 days to an average of 1-3 days, explained Sean Hargadon, spokesman for United States Postal Service.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite efforts by the U.S. Postal Service to educate the public about the adjustments, Hargadon said it’s likely that those who noticed the delays weren’t aware the changes were coming.
  </p>
  <p>
   “First-Class Mail has dropped by more than 50 percent in the last 10 years, so we have adjusted the standard to reflect that,” Hargadon said. “With First-Class Mail, what people are used to is: ‘If I drop it today my friend will get it tomorrow.’ Well, not necessarily anymore.”

   article
  </a>
  also described a slower delivery times for first-class mail (partially attributed to inclement weather during the time period in question):
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In January [2015], the Postal Service eliminated overnight delivery for local first-class letters that used to arrive the next day. Anywhere from 20 percent to half of the rest of the first-class mail sent every day now takes an extra day of delivery time.
  </p>
  <p>
   National performance for single-piece first-class mail with 1-day, 2-day, and 3-5 day delivery standards declined throughout fiscal 2014 after a relatively good second quarter in fiscal 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   Postal officials have said that severe winter storms had a significant impact on performance results for many service standards, slowing trucks from driving mail to post offices or airports, where it was flown out.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  In short, it is no secret that the USPS began adjusting the speed of first-class mail delivery as far back as 2011, as they restructured their processing procedures. But those adjustments were in no way linked to any purported lower priority for Forever Stamp-bearing letters, and the USPS has repeatedly explained that Forever Stamps are treated in every way as standard first-class postage.
