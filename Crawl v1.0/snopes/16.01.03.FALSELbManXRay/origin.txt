 <p>
  Keith weighs 70 stone and has not left his home in 11 years, or moved from his bed in two. Too big to walk, wash or even go to the toilet, Keith is desperate to gain independence.
 </p>
 <p>
  After being bed-bound for two years, Keith must now begin a tough eight-month programme of dieting and physiotherapy. Although he manages to lose over 20 stone, he fails in his attempt to stand. Hopes of life-saving surgery seem to be slipping away.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a fortnight, Keith manages to stand for the first time in years. Surgery can now go ahead, but whether Keith can survive an operation and begin the next stage in his fight for a normal life now hangs in the balance. With the help of his family and obesity experts, can he turn his life around â€” or is it too late?
