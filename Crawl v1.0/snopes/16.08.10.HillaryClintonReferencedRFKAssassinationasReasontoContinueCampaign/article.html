  On 9 August 2016 GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump was widely
  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/10/politics/trump-second-amendment/" target="_blank">
   criticized
  </a>
  for a comment he made about Hillary Clinton that was widely interpreted as an incitement to violence against his presidential rival:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Donald J. Trump appeared to raise the possibility that gun rights supporters could take matters into their own hands if Hillary Clinton is elected president and appoints judges who favor stricter gun control measures.
  </p>
  <p>
   Repeating his contention that Mrs. Clinton wanted to abolish the right to bear arms, Mr. Trump warned at a rally that it would be “a horrible day” if Mrs. Clinton were elected and got to appoint a tiebreaking Supreme Court justice.
  </p>
  <p>
   “If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,” Mr. Trump said, as the crowd began to boo. He quickly added: “Although the Second Amendment people — maybe there is, I don’t know.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Oblique as it was, Mr. Trump’s remark quickly elicited a wave of condemnation from Democrats, gun control advocates and others, who accused him of suggesting violence against Mrs. Clinton or liberal jurists.
