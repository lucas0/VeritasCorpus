 <p>
  In a shocking report released Tuesday by the Multi-State Lottery Association, Wednesday’s lottery drawing worth an estimated $1.5 billion has been canceled due to
  <em>
   “unethical match-fixing by the association.”
  </em>
  The historical lottery prize amount raised suspicion with authorities prompting them to look into the
  <em>
   “consistency and uniformity”
  </em>
  of the balls used during the lottery sessions.
 </p>
 <p>
  What they found during their investigation, caused an immediate closure of lottery sales across the country. According to the report, many of the balls used were much lighter than the others. Prompting balls that were
  <em>
   “non-winning numbers”
  </em>
  to be pulled out of the machine. Authorities say they hope to have everyone informed to stop the sale of lottery tickets by end of business day today. A class action lawsuit has been filed by the Attorney General’s office, and they say the lottery Association will be responsible for returning the lost funds.
