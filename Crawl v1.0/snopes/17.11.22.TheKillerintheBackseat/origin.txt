 <p>
  A friend stopped at a pay-at-the-pump gas station to get gas. Once she filled her gas tank and after paying at the pump and starting to leave, the voice of the attendant inside came over the speaker.. He told her that something happened with her card and that she needed to come inside to pay. The lady was confused because the transaction showed complete and approved. She relayed that to him and was getting ready to leave but the attendant, once again, urged her to come in to pay or there’d be trouble. She proceeded to go inside and started arguing with the attendant about his threat. He told her to calm down and listen carefully:
 </p>
 <p>
  He said that while she was pumping gas, a guy slipped into the back seat of her car on the other side and the attendant had already called the police.She became frightened and looked out in time to see her car door open and the guy slip out. The report is that the new gang initiation thing is to bring back a woman and/or her car. One way they are doing this is crawling under women’s cars while they’re pumping gas or at grocery stores in the nighttime. The other way is slipping into unattended cars and kidnapping the women.Please pass this on to other women, young and old alike. Be extra careful going to and from your car at night.

  If at all possible, don’t go alone! This is real!!

  The message:
 </p>
 <p>
  1. ALWAYS lock your car doors, even if you’re gone for just a second!
 </p>
 <p>
  2. Check underneath your car when approaching it for reentry, and check in the back before getting in.
 </p>
 <p>
  3. Always be aware of your surroundings and of other individuals in your general vicinity, particularly at night!
 </p>
 <p>
  Send this to everyone so your friends can take precaution.

  AND GUYS…YOU TELL ANY WOMEN YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS Thanks,
