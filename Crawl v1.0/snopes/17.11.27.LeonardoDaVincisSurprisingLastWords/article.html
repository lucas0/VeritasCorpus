  Did Leonardo da Vinci — one of history’s great geniuses, and a prolific inventor, artist, architect and ‘Renaissance Man’ — have such humility and perfectionism that he actually apologized on his death bed for the lack of “quality” in his life’s work? Is it possible that the painter of the Mona Lisa and the Last Supper left this world feeling he had “offended God and mankind” with his deficiencies?
 </p>
 <p>
  These are the surprising implications of a quotation widely attributed to Leonardo as his dying words. The quotation appears in

   Despite being considered one of the most brilliant geniuses that has ever lived, Leonardo da Vinci’s last words before dying were, “I have offended God and mankind because my work did not reach the quality it should have.”

  The original source of the quotation is a landmark text in art history:  Giorgio Vasari’s 1568 collection of biographies,
  <em>
   The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors and Architects
  </em>
  (In Italian
  <em>
   Le Vite de’ Più Eccellenti Pittori, Scultori ed Architettori
  </em>
  ).
 </p>
 <p>
  In it, Vasari gives an account of Leonardo spending his final moments in the company of King Francis I of France, one of his primary patrons. Notably, Vasari does not actually attribute the words to Leonardo as a direct quotation. Here’s what he says, according to an

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   At length, having become old, he remained ill many months, and finding himself near to death, he wished to be diligently informed of the matters of the Catholic faith, of the good way and holy Christian religion, and then with many sighs, confessed and was penitent; and although he was not able to raise himself well on his feet, supporting himself on the arms of his friends and servants, he wished to receive devoutly the most Holy Sacrament, out of his bed.
  </p>
  <p>
   The King [Francis I], who often and lovingly was used to visit him, came to see him: whereupon he, out of reverence, having raised himself to sit upon the bed, giving an account of his illness, and the circumstances of it, showed withal how he had offended God and mankind in not having laboured at his art, as he ought to have done.
  </p>
  <p>
   Whereupon he was seized with a paroxysm, the messenger of death, by reason of which the King having risen, and having taken his head, in order to aid him and show him favour, in the hope of alleviating his sufferings, his divine spirit, knowing that it could have no greater honour, expired in the arms of the King, in the 75th year of his age.

 <p>
  So instead of a direct quotation from Leonardo, we have a description of a conversation between Leonardo and Francis I by Giorgio Vasari, who was not present in the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vasari’s dramatic account of the humanist Leonardo humbling himself before God before dying in the arms of a king inspired paintings by the French artists François-Guillaume
