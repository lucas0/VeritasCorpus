  In September 2016, a graphic featuring two images appeared: One showed President Barack Obama walking in the rain while an umbrella sheltered First Lady Michelle Obama, while the other showed Donald Trump using an umbrella to keep himself dry while a nearby woman walked in the rain:

  The above-displayed image was frequently attached to messages applauding Obama’s gentlemanly behavior and criticizing Trump’s selfish nature:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Look at Donald J. Trump not sharing his umbrella while Obama walks in the rain so Michele can stay dry…
  </p>
  <p>

 </blockquote>
 <p>
  These images, however, are not accurate portrayals of either man’s moral character. As some pointed out, this image could also be used to make a “pro-Trump” statement, arguing that the pictures showed how Obama was ill-prepared for the rain, while Trump had the forethought to bring an umbrella.

  It’s also inaccurate to assume that President Obama is anti-umbrella, as several
