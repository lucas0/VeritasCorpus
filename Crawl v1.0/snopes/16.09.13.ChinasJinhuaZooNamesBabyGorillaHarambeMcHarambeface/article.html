  On 10 September 2016, the entertainment web site
  <em>
   Boston Leader
  </em>
  published an article claiming that a zoo in China held an online naming contest for a baby gorilla and that “Harambe McHarambeface” ended up as the winning entry:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A naming contest held for a baby gorilla at Jinhua Zoo, located in China’s central Zhejiang province, has announced the winning entry – which captured over 93% of all votes cast online – as “Harambe McHarambeface.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  While the
  <em>
   Boston Leader’s
  </em>
  article was
  <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/gorilla-named-harambe-mcharambeface-after-8823715" target="_blank">
   picked
  </a>
  up by news outlets, this story is a hoax; the Jinhua Zoo did not name a baby gorilla “Harambe McHarambeFace.”  The
  <em>
   Boston Leader
  </em>
  claims that it has been “bringing you Boston’s best news since 1932,” but the web site was started on 9 September 2016, a day before the baby gorilla story was published.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, while
  <em>
   Boston Leader
  </em>
  claimed to glean its information from statements a local Jinhua Zoo official gave to local media outlets, we found no record of the

  <a href="http://t.qq.com/jinhuadongwuyuan" target="_blank">
   commenting
  </a>
  on a baby gorilla named Harambe McHarambeface, nor its alleged Chinese name “Heijin.” .
 </p>
 <p>
  This hoax news story from the
  <em>
   Boston Leader
  </em>
  spoofed two big internet stories from 2016: The death of

   Harambe
  </a>
  , a gorilla shot at a Cincinnati zoo after a child fell into its enclosure, and almost naming a British research vessel “
