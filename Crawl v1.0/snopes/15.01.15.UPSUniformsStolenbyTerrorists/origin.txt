<blockquote>
 <p>
  A number of security alerts regarding UPS uniforms recently have been distributed by both private and law enforcement sources. There are two primary versions of these alerts:
 </p>
 <p>
  1) Misleading reports of a missing shipment of UPS uniforms.
  <br>
   2) Alerts regarding a large number of uniforms being purchased by an individual.
  </br>
 </p>
 <p>
  Reports that a shipment of UPS uniforms is missing are simply not true. There is no missing shipment of uniforms.
 </p>
 <p>
  As for alerts regarding uniforms being purchased by an individual, this matter has been investigated by law enforcement with UPSâ€™ involvement and cooperation and resolved to the satisfaction of all parties.
 </p>
 <p>
  UPS does not condone the sale or unauthorized use of its uniforms. UPS investigates reports of such unauthorized use but due to security concerns, we are not at the liberty to discuss such matters in any further detail.
