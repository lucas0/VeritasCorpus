  In June 2015, Facebook users began seeing posts advertising a “Get $100 in Free Groceries when you spend $110 or more in one transaction” coupon offer for the Kroger grocery store chain. These posts were the latest iteration of the common “free coupon” or “free gift card” scams that frequently plague social media. On 15 June 2015 the Kroger Company took to

  These fake coupon and gift card offers are typically scams that promise rewards to anyone who follows a simple three-step process: Share the message on Facebook, leave a comment, and like the message. These three steps ensure the scam message circulates to thousands of people on Facebook

  Previous versions of the scam, for example, featured a similar message that invaded Facebook promising a $250 gift card. The message redirected to a web page that was not affiliated with Kroger despite the fact that it was adorned with the company’s logo:

  This page instructed shoppers to follow “three simple steps” in order to get a free gift card. Once the steps were completed, however, users were not greeted with a coupon code. Instead, they were asked to fill out a brief survey and provide personal information such as home address, telephone number, e-mail address, and date of birth. Users were also required to sign up for credit cards or enroll in subscription programs in order to obtain their “free” gift cards.

  Kroger has repeatedly warned their customers not to fall victims to this form of scam:

  These fraudulent surveys are quite popular on Facebook, and if you frequently use that social network there is a good chance that you’ll run into one of these survey scams again. A July 2014

   article

  from the Better Business Bureau lists key factors for identifying fraudulent Facebook posts:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Don’t believe what you see. It’s easy to steal the colors, logos and header of an established organization. Scammers can also make links look like they lead to legitimate websites and emails appear to come from a different sender.
  </p>
  <p>
   Legitimate businesses do not ask for credit card numbers or banking information on customer surveys. If they do ask for personal information, like an address or email, be sure there’s a link to their privacy policy.
  </p>
  <p>
   When in doubt, do a quick web search. If the survey is a scam, you may find alerts or complaints from other consumers. The organization’s real website may have further information.
  </p>
  <p>
   Watch out for a reward that’s too good to be true. If the survey is real, you may be entered in a drawing to win a gift card or receive a small discount off your next purchase. Few businesses can afford to give away $50 gift cards for completing a few questions.
