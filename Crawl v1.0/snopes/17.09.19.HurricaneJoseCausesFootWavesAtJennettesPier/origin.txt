  Hurricane Jose — The worst of the storm is brushing past the Outer Banks and we’re experiencing high winds, waves and ocean over wash in several places along N.C. 12 in Nags Head. Ocean waves are not, however, crashing over the end of the pier as portrayed on social media by a local photographer. We hope the ESA Championships will restart this week as soon as things calm down.
