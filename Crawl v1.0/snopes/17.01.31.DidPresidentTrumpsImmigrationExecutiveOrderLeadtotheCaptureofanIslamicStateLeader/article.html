   Terror suspect, Rasheed Muhammad, was arrested on Tuesday, January 31, at approximately 1:32AM EST at John F. Kennedy International Airport. This marks the first successful story following President Trump’s executive order to protect the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States. Muhammad, 32, was questioned due to the heightened security measures that resulted from the presidential executive order. The suspect attempted to enter the country with a tourist visa and claimed to be visiting family in order to attend this year’s Super Bowl LI.

   Former Attorney General, Sally Yates, who was ousted by President Trump after failing to support the executive order, released a public apology via popular social media, Snapchat.

  Times.com.mx’s claim that an Islamic State operative named Rasheed Muhammed was captured at Kennedy airport in the wake of the entry ban is not the first time the site has spread fake news. Also in January 2017, the outlet reported that drug kingpin

  The site is one of several that mimics the web addresses and graphics of mainstream news organizations in order to more effectively spread hoaxes.
