  This item about how to determine if, and on what days, stores in the Target retail chain will mark down their prices has been shared widely on social media sites such as Pinterest and Tumblr for several years now.  Expanded versions of this item offer additional details:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Target marks items down with percentages: 15%, 30%, 50%, 75% &amp; 90%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The upper right hand corner of the price tag will tell you the percentage off.
  </p>
  <p>
   Item will remain at a percentage off for usually two weeks before progressing to the next level.
  </p>
  <p>
   Consumable items, furniture, and electronics are generally the only things that go 15%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Target’s full prices end in 9. Thereafter each price drop will reduce the final digit in the price to either an 8, 6, or 4. (e.g., A $9.99 item at 30% off will be priced $6.98)
  </p>
  <p>
   The lowest the last digit will drop is to 4. If you see something you want and the price ends in 4, buy it. The price won’t go any lower.
