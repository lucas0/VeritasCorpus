 <p>
  Q: What’s the truth?
 </p>
 <p>
  A: Mars gets close to Earth every two years. So, last year, Mars was very close. Three years ago, it was spectacularly
  <nobr>
   close …
  </nobr>
  And right now, I’m sad to say, Mars is actually behind the Sun; we can’t see it at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  Q: How wide spread is this falsehood?
 </p>
 <p>
  A: People get excited about it, start to send
  <nobr>
   e-mail …
  </nobr>
  and every August we see this
  <nobr>
   e-mail
  </nobr>
  coming back and I get a lot of e-mails about it, of course.
