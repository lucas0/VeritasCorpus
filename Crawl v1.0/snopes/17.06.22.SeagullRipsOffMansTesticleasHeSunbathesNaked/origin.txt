 <p>
  A male tourist who chose to sunbathe in the nude on a popular beach near Townsville on the north-eastern coast of Queensland is recovering from serious injuries to his genitals after being bitten by a sea eagle.

 <p>
  According to a source at the clinic that treated him, he has completely lost one testicle which imploded under the pressure of the eagle’s beak. The other testicle was almost severed but remains ‘hanging by a thread.’ Witnesses at Saunders Beach, a popular nudist beach west of Townsville, say that the man’s undoing may have been applying sunscreen too liberally to his genitals.
