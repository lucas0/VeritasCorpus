  On 10 September 2016, a
  <a href="http://archive.is/QksdK" target="_blank">
   photograph
  </a>
  of a man with a baby at a coffin containing the bodies of a young woman and two small children appeared on social media. The description said:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A mother and her two children died in a car accident ,,her son is with his father ..please dont ignore pray for his family …It just take only few seconds to leave you amen
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The Facebook post was a clear and cynical example of
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2016/01/15/death-hoaxes-like-farming/" target="_blank">
   like-farming
  </a>
  , the practice of using shareable images and compelling stories to increase one’s reach on social media. Typically, the person who posts a heartrending or otherwise emotionally stirring then implores users to interact with the photograph (and then switches around the page or photograph to make it appear as though a product or story is far more popular than it actually is).
 </p>
 <p>
  In this particular case, the photograph shows Denis Bukhantsov and his infant son Mark gazing at his late wife Alina and their two older children. According to an October 2012 news

  , the three Bukhantsovs were murdered by a family member:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The bodies of Alina, 23, Emmanuela, 3 and Avenir, 2, were together in a large open casket in the center of the church’s front platform.
  </p>
  <p>
   Long lines of mourners filed by to view the deceased, who were well known in Sacramento’s Russian-American community.
  </p>
  <p>
   Denis Bukhantsov, the husband and father, is now left with only his 6-month-old son Mark, who was not hurt in Tuesday’s attack.
  </p>
  <p>
   Burkhantsov’s 19-year-old brother, Grigoriy, was arrested Wednesday morning and faces murder charges.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  Although liking and sharing Facebook posts of a misleading nature (or answering a plea to “type amen”) does not necessarily pose a direct risk to users, photographs used for such a purpose are nearly always stolen and misrepresented.
