  The message claims that WalMart gave permission for immigrants to be trapped in its stores on March 20. The message adds to support the Hispanic movement by not shopping at WalMart, and to spread the word.

 <p>
  Senior Pastor David Stepp at Bakersfield Hispanic Church is concerned about the affects the text message can have. “This could affect traffic in stores and East Bakersfield,” he said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stepp also became concerned when members of his congregation held a meeting about the text. “Panic, fear, mistrust of WalMart,” is how he described their mood.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stepp added that he didn’t believe the text message when he first heard about it. “There were too many inconsistencies, didn’t sound right,” he said.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the text messages have gone beyond simple warnings telling people to stay away from WalMart. The latest ones actually claim that two bus loads of immigrants were picked up from the East Hills WalMart.
