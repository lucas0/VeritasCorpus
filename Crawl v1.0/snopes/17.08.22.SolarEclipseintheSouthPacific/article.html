  Numerous factors suggested that this image was not genuine. For starters, the sun and moon both appeared much larger in the sky than they would as viewed by a ground observer. Additionally, the eclipse appeared to be happening in

  </em>
  of the clouds seen here, even though the sun and moon are obviously much farther away than the Earth’s cloud cover is.

  The “ocean eclipse” image is a composite of at least two different photographs. The ocean picture was posted to

  in 2009 by photographer Art Lewis (and although it has since been removed from Flickr, it is still widely available on various computer wallpaper sites:
