  On 24 June 2016, the web site
  <em>
   Associated Media Coverage
  </em>
  published an article reporting that several Islamic Cultural Centers throughout the United States had donated an aggregate $87,000 to the family of Omar Mateen, the man responsible for gunning down 49 people in a June 2016 mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   According to several recent reports, the Muslim community has made a donation in excess of $87,000 to the family of Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen.
  </p>
  <p>
   It’s currently unknown how the funds will be distributed, however it’s been said that the majority of the $87,000 will be allocated to Omar Mateen’s widow Noor Salman and father Seddique Mateen. Sources indicate that the remaining funds will be distributed among Omar’s siblings. Prior to distributing the donation, the Mateen family is expected to provide Omar with a ‘proper Islamic funeral’.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to reports, the $87,000 was comprised of donations made on behalf of several Islamic Cultural Centers throughout the United States.

 </blockquote>

  There is no truth to this report, however.
