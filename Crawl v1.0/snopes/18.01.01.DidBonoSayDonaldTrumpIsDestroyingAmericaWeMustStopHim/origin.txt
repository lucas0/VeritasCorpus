  U2 frontman Bono has joined the long list of celebrities to bash Donald Trump in a painfully long Rolling Stone article this week when he highlighted Trump’s criticism of the mainstream media in what he described as “the bleakest era since Nixon.
 </p>
 <p>
  ”Bono, who regularly rubs shoulders with elites like George Soros and Bill Clinton, claimed that fairness and equality were “not improving” under Trump.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Irish rocker went on to say that the working class people of America’s “innocence died when they elected Donald Trump” stating that a generation “
  <em>
   growing up think that human spirit towards fairness and justice
  </em>
  ” was learning it might not be the case.

  <strong>
   “Donald Trump is destroying America, we must stop him” he added. “He’s destroying the America that I love, the country that allowed me to be involved in politics”.
