  In late May 2016, many Facebook users shared a
  <a href="http://archive.is/eJJPB" target="_blank">
   link
  </a>
  to the domain nancypelosi.org, in particular to a page dated 2 February 2016 in which the former House Speaker (and current House Minority Leader) purportedly announced her endorsement of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sander as “Clearly the most qualified candidate with a vision for our future”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Press Release: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Endorses Senator Bernie Sanders: “Clearly the most qualified candidate with a vision for our future”
  </p>
  <p>
   WASHINGTON, DC- House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders today for Democratic Nominee for Presidential of the United States of America.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following is a transcript of her official endorsement:
  </p>
  <p>
   “I am going on record to officially endorse Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Election for President. During his inspiring campaign rise over the last several months, Senator Sanders has proven that he has the vision and conviction to lead America. Furthermore, his showing in Iowa yesterday proved that he can capture the hearts, minds, and votes of the American people.[“]
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The increase in social media sharing of that page in May 2016 might have had something to do with recent comments made by Pelosi regarding Sanders. On 19 May 2016,
  <em>
   The Hill
  </em>
  <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/280609-pelosi-defends-sanders-a-positive-force-for-dems" target="_blank">
   reported
  </a>
  that Pelosi had defended Sanders’ continuing his long-shot race for the Democratic nomination, but that outlet noted that Pelosi had yet to endorse either Democratic candidate:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) defended Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) from Democratic critics growing restless with his long-shot presidential campaign.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pelosi hailed Sanders for energizing young voters, arguing that his appeal will play to the advantage of all Democrats in November.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Bernie Sanders is a positive force in the Democratic Party,” Pelosi said during a press briefing in the Capitol.
  </p>
  <p>
   “He has awakened in some people an interest in the political process that wasn’t there. He has encouraged young people to channel their interest in public service and community leadership into a political place, because this is where decisions are made that’ll affect their future and their lives. And I think that’s positive.”
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Pelosi, who has not endorsed a presidential candidate
   </strong>
   , has a different take. While condemning the Nevada violence, she also downplayed the Democratic divisions, saying they pale in comparison to those dogging the Republicans struggling to unify behind Trump’s likely nomination. On most issues, she noted, Clinton and Sanders agree.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Pelosi was also named in a 24 May 2016 ABC News
  <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democratic-leaders-havent-endorsed-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders/story?id=39314846" target="_blank">
   item
  </a>
  regarding prominent Democrats who had yet to endorse either candidate. Again, Pelosi’s not having endorsed either Clinton or Sanders was the piece’s primary focus:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi
  </p>
  <p>
   The House Democratic leader is the only member of the Democratic leadership in Congress who hasn’t backed the party front-runner.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ahead of Super Tuesday, Pelosi told reporters she was withholding an endorsement out of respect for the “voice” of American people.
  </p>
  <p>
   Earlier this month, the California lawmaker said she expects Clinton to win the general election in November.
  </p>
  <p>
   “We’re very proud of Hillary Clinton and what she will bring to the Oval Office when she’s president of the United States,” Pelosi said despite praising Sanders for his “positive force” in the Democratic party.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Given that Nancy Pelosi was somewhat of a noteworthy outlier among high-ranking Democrats for not having endorsed a candidate as of May 2016, her purported endorsement of Sanders in February 2016 (and the nancypelosi.org site on which it appeareD) was clearly a hoax.
