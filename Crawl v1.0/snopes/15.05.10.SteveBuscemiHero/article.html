  City firefighter, joining the FDNY’s Engine

   Co. 55

  in Manhattan’s Little Italy section in 1980 and serving with that company for four years, as he told a
  <em>
   Salon
  </em>
  interviewer:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Q: You were once a fireman in Manhattan. Were you also acting during that time?
  </p>
  <p>
   A: I was a fireman for four years, from 1980 to ’84. My first year on the job, I didn’t do any acting, even though I had gone to school for acting and had done some stand-up comedy before I took the job. But after I had been on the job for about a year, I started going back to acting classes. It was around that time that I met Mark Boone and we started doing our own work. And then I started working with the theater group Willem Dafoe was with. I was constantly doing theater, and the first couple of films I did, I was still with the fire department —
   <nobr>
    Engine 55,
   </nobr>
   in Little Italy. I was in the engine company, which means we were responsible for getting in there with the hose and putting out the fire.
  </p>
  <p>
   Q: Were there any situations that were particularly hairy?
  </p>
  <p>
   A: Well, they’re all frightening. Any time you go into a burning building, there’s the potential for disaster. I never had any real close calls, though there’s no such thing as a routine fire.
  </p>
  <p>
   Q:  Why did you become a firefighter?
  </p>
  <p>
   A: My dad had encouraged me to take the civil service test when I was 18. So I did, and I kind of forgot about it until my name came up on the list four years later. By then I was living in Manhattan, working as a furniture mover during the day, doing
   <nobr>
    stand-up
   </nobr>
   comedy at night and looking for a change. I liked the job — the guys I worked with and the nature of the work. I think I would have been happy doing it if I hadn’t had a greater passion for acting.
