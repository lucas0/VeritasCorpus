  “Crowd envy” reared its ugly head more than once during the 2016 presidential race, as supporters of various candidates passed around photos purporting to demonstrate superior drawing power at campaign events.
 </p>
 <p>
  Often those photos were fake or misrepresented, as in the case of a Donald Trump
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/photograph-shows-100000-bikers-at-trump-rally/" target="_blank">
   rally
  </a>
  said to have taken place in May 2016 and supposedly attended by 100,000 well-behaved bikers. The photo, though real, actually depicted an unrelated event that took place in 2013. Or the case of a
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/bernie-sanders-rally-california/" target="_blank">
   massive
  </a>
  Bernie Sanders rally and march that also allegedly took place in May.  It turned out that photo was of a May Day march in Havana, Cuba.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were efforts to falsify crowd size in the other direction, as well — to make it appear that one’s opponent was losing steam. Here is an example

  News reports indicate that the picnic was actually quite well attended earlier in the day when Clinton rival Bernie Sanders spoke, but most of the crowd left when he did.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Stabenow photo circulated again under false pretenses in late October and early November 2016, as part of an image macro sarcastically referencing Clinton’s allegation that Russian hackers were behind the theft of State Department and campaign-related e-mails released during the election cycle by WikiLeaks:
