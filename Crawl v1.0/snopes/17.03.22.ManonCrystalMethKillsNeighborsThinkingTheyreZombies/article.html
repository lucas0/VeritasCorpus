  On 20 October 2016, the World News Daily Report (WNDR) web site published an article positing that a Georgia man who was high on meth went on a killing frenzy after binge-watching too many episodes of the popular AMC television post-apocalyptic zombie drama,
  <em>
   The Walking Dead
  </em>
  :

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Atlanta, Georgia | A 32-year old man went on a killing frenzy last night, after spending 36 hours in a row watching Walkind Dead while doing drugs.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to the police, Kevin Fogarty was so badly intoxicated with crystal meth, that he became convinced his apartment was surrounded by zombies.
  </p>
  <p>
   He equipped himself with an assault rifle, two pistols, a machette and a hammer, before going outside to “kill undead”.

  The same story was published (in a typo-corrected version) by the Now8News web site on 20 March 2017.  Neither report was true, however, as World News Daily Report and Now8News are both fake news sites.  The former, at least, carries a disclaimer indicating its content is satirical:

 <blockquote>

   WNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website – even those based on real people –  are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.

  The photograph of the killing spree “suspect” that accompanied these articles was previously used online to illustrate a
