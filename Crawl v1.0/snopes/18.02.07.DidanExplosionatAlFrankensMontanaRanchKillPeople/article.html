   Investigators are looking for answers after six people died in an explosion at Al Franken’s Montana ranch. The explosion, which appears to have originated in the basement, was heard nearly three miles away. The closest neighbor, a farm nearly a mile away, felt what they thought was a “mild earthquake. When first-responders arrived on site, they found a huge hole in the center of the ranch and bodies strewn about the surrounding area.

  The featured photograph in this article does show a real fire. However, it did not occur on Al Franken’s Montana ranch. Notably: We found no evidence that Franken actually owns a ranch in Montana.
