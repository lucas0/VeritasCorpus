  a fake news story claiming that Fox Sports, a subsidiary of Fox Broadcasting Company, would suspend the broadcast of professional football games:

  <p>
   Fox Sports took things a step farther Sunday morning with a bombshell announcement that until players either stop disrespecting our country or are fired to do so, they will not be airing any games.
