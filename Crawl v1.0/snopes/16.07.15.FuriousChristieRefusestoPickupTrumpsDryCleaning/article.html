  On 15 July 2016, after Donald Trump announced Indiana governor Mike Pence as his choice of running mate in the upcoming presidential election, the
  <em>
   New Yorker
  </em>
  published an
  <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/furious-christie-refuses-to-pick-up-trumps-dry-cleaning" target="_blank">
   piece
  </a>
  suggesting that incensed New Jersey governor Chris Christie had expressed his anger at being passed over for the VP slot by refusing to retrieve Trump’s dry cleaning:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Governor Chris Christie, of New Jersey, angrily refused to pick up Donald Trump’s dry cleaning during a tense encounter between the two men on Friday, campaign sources confirm.
  </p>
  <p>
   The ugly scene unfolded at the billionaire’s offices in midtown Manhattan, shortly after Trump revealed that his Vice-Presidential pick would be Governor Mike Pence of Indiana.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to Trump aides, Christie stomped into the presumptive Republican nominee’s office and hurled a dry-cleaning ticket onto his desk, telling Trump, “You can pick up your own damn dry cleaning.”
  </p>
  <p>
   The New Jersey governor then stormed out, and has not been seen by Trump or his staffers since.
  </p>
  <p>
   Trump’s press secretary, Hope Hicks, warned the media against making too much of the apparent rift between the billionaire and Christie. “In the long hours of a campaign, emotions can sometimes get a little raw,” she said. “We are confident that Governor Christie will pick up Mr. Trump’s dry cleaning going forward.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The piece played on media perceptions that Christie was a likely pick for Trump’s vice-presidential spot (as well as rampant speculation that Christie had essentially campaigned for the spot via his subservience to a former GOP rival) and painted Christie as a figure reduced to objecting through engaging in passive-aggressive refusal of assistant-level tasks. But the article was a piece of humorous fiction written by
  <em>
   New Yorker
  </em>
  satirist Andy Borowitz, not one of the outlet’s straightforward news pieces.

  While most “satirical” outlets aim to dupe social media users into sharing fake and often offensive stories, Borowitz is one of the few genuine satirists regularly making light of current events. His
