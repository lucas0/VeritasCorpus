  Taking a weekend break from official duties on her Asian tour, the first lady escaped already-remote Katmandu and traveled two hours by prop plane, land rover and rowboat to the Tiger Tops Jungle Lodge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Later, she got to meet Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person to reach Mount Everest’s summit in 1953.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sir Edmund Hillary, a frequent visitor and benefactor of Nepal since his historic trek, had a brief Hillary-to-Hillary handshake at the Katmandu airport before Clinton departed Sunday for Bangladesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first lady said her mother had read about the famous climber and knew his name had two L’s.
 </p>
 <p>
  “So when I was born, she called me Hillary and she always told me, ‘It’s because of
  <nobr>
   Sir Edmund
  </nobr>
  Hillary,'” Hillary Clinton reported.

  For her part, Mrs. Clinton confessed that her mother, Dorothy Rodham, had read an article about the intrepid Edmund Hillary, a one-time beekeeper who had taken to mountain climbing, when she was pregnant with her daughter in 1947 and liked the name.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It had two l’s, which is how she thought she was supposed to spell Hillary,”
  <nobr>
   Mrs. Clinton
  </nobr>
  told reporters after the brief meeting on the tarmac, minutes before her Air Force jet flew past the peak of Everest itself. “So when I was born, she called me Hillary, and she always told me it’s because of
  <nobr>
   Sir Edmund
  </nobr>
  Hillary.”
