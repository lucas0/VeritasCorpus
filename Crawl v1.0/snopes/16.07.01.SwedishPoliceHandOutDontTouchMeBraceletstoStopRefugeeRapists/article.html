  On 30 June 2016, the
  <em>
   Federalist Papers
  </em>
  web site  published an article reporting that police in Sweden were distributing distinctive bracelets to “stop refugee rape”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Police in Sweden have come up with a sure-fire way to stop Middle Eastern refugees from raping local women: wristbands that read “Don’t Touch Me.”
  </p>
  <p>
   In a press release announcing the idiotic attempt to stem the flood of women reporting being sexually assaulted, the national police announced that “groping is a crime.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “No one should have to accept sexual molestation. So do not grope. And if you are groped, report it to the police,” said Chief Dan Eliasson, Breitbart is reporting.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Like many similar articles, the site approached the story from the assumption Sweden and other European countries had seen an uptick of sexual assaults  due to an influx of refugees from the Middle East:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Notwithstanding the fact that most men bent on raping a woman aren’t going to be dissuaded by a silicone bracelet,
   <strong>
    since the surge in reports is due to Middle Eastern perpetrators
   </strong>
   , they’re unlikely to be able to read the bracelets anyway — which are written in Swedish.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another super-cool advantage of wearing the bracelets — besides clearly providing a shroud of protection from rapists &amp;mdas; is that it can “draw attention to the issue of sexual assault and urge those affected to report.”

   approached
  </a>
  the bracelets from the assumption that their production was directly and unequivocally a result of sexual assaults committed by refugees in Sweden:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   It is unclear how effective the wristbands, which read “don’t touch me” in Swedish, will be in preventing attacks, as the majority of sex attack perpetrators are thought to be recent migrants who are unlikely to be able to read them.

   press release

  issued by police in Sweden. But the press release pertained to unwanted sexual advances among youth, it didn’t
  <br>
   target rape, migrants, or linguistic barriers that might inhibit the bracelets’ effectiveness:
  </br>
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Groping is a crime. In summer, the police use the bracelet to initiate conversations with young people about the problem. “No one should accept sexual molestation. So do not grope. And a police report if you have been a victim,” said national police chief Dan Eliasson.
  </p>
  <p>
   A hand tucked between the legs, a hug from behind in the crush at a club or a festival, a person who holds another while a third fondles their breasts, sexual pictures shown or sent to someone who has not asked for them.  There are situations with which many young people are all too familiar.
  </p>
  <p>
   Police are taking sexual molestation seriously, specifically among young people. It is obviously a very offensive crime that the whole community must become better at working towards preventing, said Dan Eliasson.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now the police are being supplied with bracelets that read “don’t grope” to assist them in engaging young people. The bracelets will be distributed during the summer in connection with festivals and other major events targeted to young people, to prompt both boys and girls to start talking about these  problems and demonstrate that they have taken a stand.
