  shared a photograph of what appeared to be a Salvation Army bell ringer holding a sign that read, “We help people, just not the gays”:

  One post was captioned that the sign was “something to remember this holiday season,” while another said “Just a friendly reminder that ‘the gays’ aren’t people. Brought to you by your local Salvation Army.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Neither post included information about the photograph, such as its subject, the date on which it was taken, or any other details enabling readers to put the image in context.  As a result, some people interpreted the photograph to be that of an actual Salvation Army volunteer announcing the organization’s views on its placard.

  Although the origin of the image is still unknown, the scene it showed was originally presented as a protest and not a Salvation Army initiative. Nevertheless, we contacted the organization for further information about the photograph but did not receive a reply.
