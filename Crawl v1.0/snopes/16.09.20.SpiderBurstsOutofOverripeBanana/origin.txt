  Despite being the work of a student, R’ha is so good it’s already attracted the attention of Hollywood executives. After seeing Lechowski’s creation online, Scott Glassgold, of the managing company IAM Sports &amp; Entertainment, was impressed. “His work is not only professional, it’s extraordinary,” Glassgold [said]. “There are shots in there that look like they are from a 150-million-dollar movie.” Glassgold has experience with science fiction, [and] he sold the shorts Rosa and True Skin to studios last year.
