<blockquote>
 <p>
  A heavily armed group of men with Middle Eastern appearance was arrested two hours ago outside Los Angeles after opening fire upon Hikers and Campers in a large State Park in the area.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to the victim/witness, there were two groups of men, about 15 per group, armed with heavy weapons, who began shouting “Allah u Akbar” and started firing. The firing allegedly lasted upwards of TWO HOURS before police were able to find callers in the vast California parkland.
 </p>
 <p>
  When police were responding, one group of 15 or so men took-off into the hills, while the other group was captured by police.
