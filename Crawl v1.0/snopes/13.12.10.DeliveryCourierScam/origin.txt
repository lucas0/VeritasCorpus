  Hi everyone,
 </p>
 <p>
  I want to let you all know that Frank and I have been the victims of credit card fraud this week and felt I should warn you all about the clever scam. It works like this:
 </p>
 <p>
  Last Wednesday I had a phone call late morning from Express Couriers to ask if I was going to be home as he had a delivery for me.  He said he would there in roughly an hour.  He turned up with a beautiful basket of flowers and wine. I expressed my surprise as I wasn’t expecting anything like this and said I was intrigued to know who was sending me such a lovely gift.  He said he was only delivering the gift and the card was being sent separately (the card has never arrived).
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a consignment note with the gift.
 </p>
 <p>
  He went on to explain that because the gift contained alcohol he has to charge the recipient $3.50 as proof that he has actually delivered to an adult, and not left it on a door step if the recipient is out, to be
  <br>
   stolen or taken by children.
  </br>
 </p>
 <p>
  This seemed logical and I offered to get the cash.  He then said that the company required the payment to be by Eftpos (short for Electronic Funds Transfer at Point of Sale)  so he’s not handling cash and everything is properly accounted for.
 </p>
 <p>
  Frank was there and got his credit card and ‘John’ swiped the card on this small mobile machine that also had a small screen upon which Frank entered in his pin number.  A receipt was printed out and given to us.
 </p>
 <p>
  Between last Thursday and Monday $4,000 was withdrawn from our credit account at ATM machines in the north shore area.  It appears a dummy credit card was made using the details in the machine and of course, they had Frank’s pin number.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Bank has stopped our cards and I’ve been to the Police this morning, where they confirmed that it is a definite scam and many households were hit during the first
  <nobr>
   3 days
  </nobr>
  of October.
 </p>
 <p>
  So PLEASE be wary of accepting a gift you’re not expecting especially if the card is not with it.   We’ve all received gifts like this and would never dream that it could be such a despicable act.
 </p>
