  An article reporting that Danielle Bergolli [sic], a teenager who gained viral fame as the “Catch Me Outside Girl” after her appearance on
  <em>
   The Dr. Phil Show,
  </em>
  had been arrested for prostitution was

  by the web site Huzlers in February 2017:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   It is being reported that internet sensation Danielle Bregoli, also know as the “catch me outside girl” who appeared on the Dr. Phil show, has been arrested for prostitution.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although appearing to be of older age, Danielle is only 13 years old. According to authorities, Danielle’s mother could not locate where Danielle was. “A 13 year old girl should not be taking off away from home for that long and not telling her mother where she is”, Barbara Bregoli told reporters. Worried for Danielle’s whereabouts, decided to notify he authorities. With a search that lasted a short 2 hours, Boynton police found Danielle inside a small motel room with a 38 year old man, whose name will remain anonymous.

  There was no truth to the above-quoted story. Huzlers is an entertainment (i.e., fake news) web site that does not publish factual stories, whose disclaimer notes that Huzlers is the “most notorious fauxtire &amp; satire entertainment website in the world.”

  This is at least the second time that a fake news story has been circulated about Bregoli. In January 2017, a fake news web site masquerading as an NBC News clone started the false rumor that the “Catch Me Outside Girl.” had committed
