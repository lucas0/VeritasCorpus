  To investigate further the relationship between handedness and age of death, we have analysed all baseball players listed in
  <i>
   The Baseball Encyclopedia
  </i>
  for whom dates of birth and death, as well as throwing and batting hand, are reported. A subject was assigned to a handedness a group only when both throwing and batting hand were the same with no indicated I change in hand use. Mean age at death for the 1,472 right-handers was 64.64 years (s.d. = 15.5) and ( 236 left-handers was 63.97 years (s.d. = 15.4).
