  There is no such thing as a “snow snake,” at least not as described above, a form of white serpent that “comes out in the cold weather” and bites victims, causing their “blood to freeze.” Snakes, like other reptiles, are cold-blooded creatures that depend upon external warming to regulate their body temperatures and cannot survive outdoors in snowy climes — species of snakes that inhabit areas with colder climates generally go into a hibernation-like state known as

  Besides, those who indulge in winter sports use the term “snow snake” to identify the mythical creature to be blamed for their downhill wipeouts.
