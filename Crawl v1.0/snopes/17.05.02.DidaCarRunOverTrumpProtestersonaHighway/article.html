  In May 2017, a video appeared on social media showing a car driving through a crowd of protesters on a highway. Many

   posts
  </a>
  of this footage lacked contextual information, leaving viewers in the dark about when and where it occurred.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Facebook group “Trump Supporters” posted the video without context, many
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/trumpsupporters1/?fref=nf" target="_blank">
   commenters
  </a>
  assumed that the protesters were liberals, part of
  <a href="https://archive.is/Hz0lR" target="_blank">
   Black Lives Matter
  </a>
  , that they were protesting President

   Donald Trump
  </a>
  , and that the incident took place somewhere in the United States:

  This video shows an incident that

  on 28 April 2017 in the Brazilian city Sao Jose dos Campos during an anti-austerity protest. According to Globo.com, two women were injured during the incident (not critically) and the driver was arrested for attempted murder:

    When the vehicle arrived at the site, demonstrators had already occupied the highway. The driver tried to move forward, but the vehicle was surrounded. He then drives backward and pulls off the demonstrators. Film reporter Wilson Araújo, from TV Vanguarda, recorded the moment.

    The injured women were rescued by the Rescue at the Industrial Village emergency room. They suffered bruises and were discharged from the unit at night.
   </p>
   <p>
    The driver who got involved in the hit was prosecuted and arrested for attempted murder – he remains detained this Saturday (29).

   A second video of the incident clearly shows that the protesters were holding protest signs in Portuguese, one of which read “Greve geral contra las reformas trabalhista e da previdencia,” or “General strike against the labor and social security reforms”:

  <p>
   In short, any interpretation of this video involving anti-Trump protesters is resoundingly false.
