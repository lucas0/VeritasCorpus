  Citing irreconcilable differences, the former Democratic nominee for President apparently is seeking a divorce from her longtime husband former President Bill Clinton.  Bill Clinton is named as the defendant in the legal filing, and Hillary’s signature appears beside her listing as the plaintiff.  The plaintiff’s signature is often included in these types of filings to certify and expedite the legal process.
