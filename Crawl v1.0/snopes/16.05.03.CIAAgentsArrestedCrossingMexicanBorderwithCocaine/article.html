  In late April 2015, the fake news outlet
  <em>
   World News Daily Report
  </em>
  published an
  <a href="http://archive.is/lpSu2/image" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  reporting that two Central Intelligence Agency agents were arrested by “
  <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2014/0430/What-happened-to-Minuteman-Project-It-s-still-roiling-immigration-reform" target="_blank">
   minutemen
  </a>
  ” at the Mexican border while in possession of massive amounts of cocaine:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A group of minutemen watching the Mexican Border for illegal migrants and drug traffickers, have proceeded to the citizen arrest of two men in an SUV, carrying 1300 pounds of cocaine. The volunteers were completely astonished when the two arrestees pulled out CIA ID cards and explained they were actually carrying the drug as part of their duties and that the cargo belonged to the Central Intelligence Agency.
  </p>
  <p>
   The incident took place last night, in the Chihuahuan desert, near the Texan city of El Paso. A group of seven minutemen saw a large black SUV drive rapidly across the border. They chased the vehicle in their own trucks and achieved to immobilize it after a chase of more than 15 miles.
  </p>
  <p>
   The vigilantes arrested the two men on board and called the border patrol, who proceeded to search the vehicle. They discovered dozens of packages of cocaine, totalling an incredible 618.4 kilograms (1363 pounds).

 <p>
  For unclear reasons, the claim began circulating widely on Facebook in early May 2016, one year after it was originally published.  The image used by
  <em>
   World News Daily Report
  </em>
  dated back to at least
  <a href="http://www.tineye.com/search/5582d9d8b4261c8afe80d4d4cdc576279e2a2f5b/?sort=crawl_date&amp;order=asc" target="_blank">
   2014
  </a>
  , and was unrelated to any CIA-involved incident at the border in 2015. There is no truth to the claim, as is consistently the case with content created by that web site.
