 </p>
 <p>
  One such shoot produced a photograph that showed a very pregnant Melania Trump, posing in a golden bikini and gold body paint on the entranceway to a jet with her husband, Donald Trump, sitting nearby on the tarmac in a

   The Donald’s very pregnant wife is trumping the slew of expecting stars who’ve been photographed before her, by wearing nothing but a teeny bikini and sky-high heels in a sexy new shoot.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fabulous mom-to-be Melania Trump, 34, is wearing gold body paint for this Annie Leibovitz portrait, which will apear in the April issue of Vogue. Her normally centerstage husband sits of to the side in the $600,000 Mercedes SLR McLaren he gave her last year.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I think it’s very sexy for a woman to be pregnant,” Melania tells Vogue. “I think it’s beautiful, carrying a baby inside.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Donald is thrilled with the photo, which was taken near his Mar-a-Lago restort in Palm, Beach, FLa. Donald is pleased that a wind machine was used so that everyone could see he doesn’t wear a hairpiece,” Vogue reports.
  </p>
  <p>
   Melanis , who is due this month, says her child will be raised in a manner that is “strict, but not too strict. And I think grounded, very grounded.”

  the photograph in the following way:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The show, of course, has numerous portraits that jump off the wall with characteristic Leibovitzian flair — a heady mix of intimacy and posturing, elaborated, like paintings of saints, by recognizable attributes. Here’s Demi Moore in her controversial Vanity Fair cover, naked, extremely pregnant and protected by an imposing diamond ring. There’s Donald Trump, seen as the proud possessor of a fancy car, a private jet and a beautiful young wife also heavy with child. Wearing little more than a golden bikini, Melania Trump stands on a stairway leading to the underbelly of the jet, which dominates the image like a giant male-female fertility symbol.
