  The Donald’s very pregnant wife is trumping the slew of expecting stars who’ve been photographed before her, by wearing nothing but a teeny bikini and sky-high heels in a sexy new shoot.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fabulous mom-to-be Melania Trump, 34, is wearing gold body paint for this Annie Leibovitz portrait, which will apear in the April issue of Vogue. Her normally centerstage husband sits of to the side in the $600,000 Mercedes SLR McLaren he gave her last year.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I think it’s very sexy for a woman to be pregnant,” Melania tells Vogue. “I think it’s beautiful, carrying a baby inside.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Donald is thrilled with the photo, which was taken near his Mar-a-Lago restort in Palm, Beach, FLa. Donald is pleased that a wind machine was used so that everyone could see he doesn’t wear a hairpiece,” Vogue reports.
 </p>
 <p>
  Melanis , who is due this month, says her child will be raised in a manner that is “strict, but not too strict. And I think grounded, very grounded.”
