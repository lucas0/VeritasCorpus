   ORIGIN
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  The text reproduced above is the introductory section of an Internet-circulated version of a critical article about Hungarian-American business magnate George Soros. Although the piece has long been distributed with an introduction attributing authorship to CBS
  <i>
   60 Minutes
  </i>
  correspondent Steve Kroft, he did not write any portion of it. The original was an article penned by Jim O’Neill and
  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20101027070859/http://canadafreepress.com/index.asp/article/14700" target="_blank">
   published
  </a>
  on 15 September 2009 under the title “Soros: Republic Enemy #1.” (That original version drew its information from a variety of sources which are hyperlinked within the article itself.)
 </p>
 <p>
  The confusion arose because the original quoted a few lines from Steve Kroft’s
  <a href="http://message.snopes.com/showpost.asp?p=939217&amp;postcount=4" target="int">
   interview
  </a>
  with George Soros for the 20 December 1998 broadcast of
  <i>
   60 Minutes
  </i>
  , and somewhere along the line a reader mistook that as an indication Kroft was the author of the entire article.
