 <p>
  Passengers of a cruise ship sailing off the coast of Hawaii had an extremely unpleasant surprise this morning, when chunks of frozen human waste fell on them from the sky.
 </p>
 <p>
  A Boeing 777 airplane belonging to the Taiwanese airline EVA Air, dumped human excreta midair while traveling from Japan to Hawaii.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, the content of the toilet tank was jettisoned into the sky while the plane was flying over the cruise liner
  <em>
   Lady of the Pacific
  </em>
  , which was hit by “large chunks of blue ice”.
 </p>
 <p>
  The top deck of the ship was literally covered with chunks of blue ice containing human excreta.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds of passengers were standing on the top deck at the time, and many were hit by ice projectiles weighing up to 10 lbs.
 </p>
 <p>
  North Pacific Cruise Lines, who own and operate the
  <em>
   Lady of the Pacific
  </em>
  , confirmed they would file a lawsuit against the Taiwanese airline.
