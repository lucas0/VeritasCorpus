  unveiled her latest piece of dubious evidence in her long-running quest to demonstrate that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States of America:  A photograph of a

  document purporting to be a Certified Copy of Registration of Birth issued by the Republic of Kenya in
  <nobr>
   February 1964
  </nobr>
  which recorded a “Barack
  <nobr>
   Hussein II
  </nobr>
  ” as having been born to Barack Hussein Obama and Stanley Ann (Dunham) Obama in Mombasa, Kenya, in August 1961.  Said document was reportedly obtained by
  <nobr>
   Dr. Taitz
  </nobr>
  from “an anonymous source” who didn’t want his name disclosed because he was “afraid for his life”:

  Skeptics quickly identified a variety of
  <a href="http://washingtonindependent.com/53494/birthers-latch-onto-forged-kenyan-birth-certificate" target="_blank">
   reasons
  </a>
  for questioning the legitimacy of the supposed Kenyan document, such as:
 </p>
 <p>
  <ul type="Disc">
   <br>
    <li>
     The document is dated 17 February 1964 and a bears a legend identifying it as having been issued by the “Republic of Kenya,” but Kenya (a former British colony) didn’t officially adopt that name until
     <nobr>
      12 December
     </nobr>
     1964.  In February 1964, it was known as the Dominion of Kenya.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>
     The listed age of Barack Obama’s father is incorrect.  (Barack Obama Sr. was born in 1936 and therefore would have been 24 or
     <nobr>
      25 years
     </nobr>
     old at the time of
     <nobr>
      Barack Jr.’s
     </nobr>
     birth, not 26 as shown on the document.)
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>
     Mombasa is very far (several hundred miles) away from the part of Kenya in which Barack
     <nobr>
      Obama Sr.’s
     </nobr>
     family lived. Even if Barack Obama’s parents and family had wanted to travel away from their home so his birth could take place at hospital facilities within a large city, they would likely have set out for the much closer city of Nairobi.
    </li>
    <br/>
   </br>
  </ul>
 </p>
 <p>
  Within a few days the certificate was clearly revealed to be a
  <nobr>
   fake — it
  </nobr>
  was actually a forgery based on a copy of an Australian Registration of Birth issued to one David Jeffrey Bomford (who was born in South Australia in 1959) which was grabbed off the Internet and used as a template for creating the fake Kenyan certificate:
