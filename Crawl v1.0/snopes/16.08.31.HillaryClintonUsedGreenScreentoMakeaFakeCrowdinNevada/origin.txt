  As she’s leaving, look at these two smartphones. The one at the top is shooting something else. The one at the bottom, it looks like they have a piece of baldie’s head. But here’s the top one. It looks like a white wall. There’s no american flags. There’s no red white or blue signs, There’s no mob of people. It looks like an empty set. So the question is, was the floor audience inserted by a green screen? Was the floor audience reall there. Because the floor audience is holding up there phones and their not seeing any of this.
