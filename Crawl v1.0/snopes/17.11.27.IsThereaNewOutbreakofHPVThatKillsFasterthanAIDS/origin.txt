<blockquote>
 <p>
  Students from Kisii University, Kenya and the general public at large have been warned against kissing carelessly due to an outbreak of Human papilloma virus, which has seen several people admitted at Kisii level 5 hospital after testing positive to the disease.
 </p>
 <p>
  The HPV is gradually circulating Kenya and gradually making its way into the Southern parts of Africa and will soon hit Africa at large.
 </p>
 <p>
  Africans are believed to travel a lot to all parts of the world. So if proper awareness is not created, this is likely to hit the whole world in no distance time.
 </p>
 <p>
  You are hereby advised to warn and inform family members, friends, well wishers and colleagues about this deadly disease that kills faster than HIV/AIDS.
