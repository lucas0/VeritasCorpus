  In early October 2016, the web site TMZBreaking published an offensive
  <a href="http://archive.is/oWo1w/image" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  reporting that a United Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing due to one passenger’s egregiously poor vaginal hygiene:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   United Airlines Flight 193 to D.C. had to make a an emergency landing after people were getting sick from passenger Larissa Jones smelly [vagina].
  </p>
  <p>
   Several passengers began to get sick from the smell and notified the captain and he decided to make an emergency landing in
   <br>
    Charlotte, North Carolina. Hazmat crews came on the plane to spray it down with disinfectant.
   </br>
  </p>
  <p>
   The plane landed in Charlotte and Larissa was taken to the local hospital to make sure she was still alive because she smelled like a dead corpse.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The poor grammatical style and the absence of credible reporting of the same story in legitimate news outlets didn’t dissuade a number of readers who (by design on the part of the site’s creators) confused TMZBreaking with the well-known TMZ gossip site.

  and a number of similar fake news outlets dupe readers into believing the content they’ve opened comes from the sometimes salacious but usually accurate TMZ site. All of these impostor sites have appropriated TMZ’s name for that purpose, and none of them includes a disclaimer warning readers their content is fabricated.

  The image that accompanied this fictional story appears to be a stock photograph of an airplane interior from at least
