  1995, Baltimore Orioles infielder Cal Ripken, Jr. broke a record long thought to be unassailable when he played in his 2,131st consecutive baseball game, surpassing the mark of 2,130 set by Lou Gehrig back in 1939.   Ripken would go on to play in a total of 2,632 straight games before finally sitting one out on
  <nobr>
   20 September
  </nobr>
  1998.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the most remarkable aspects of Ripken’s most remarkable of streaks was that he started every game (i.e., his streak included no pinch-hitting, pinch-running, or late-inning defensive appearances), he voluntarily left a game before the seventh inning only four times (in additiona to twice being ejected by umpires), and at one point he played every single inning of every single game for a span over five years. In other words, Ripken didn’t even come
  <i>
   close
  </i>
  to missing a game during his
  <nobr>
   streak — except,
  </nobr>
  as the rumor cited above claims, for one evening in
  <nobr>
   August 1997,
  </nobr>
  when Ripken was unable to make it to the park for that day’s game due to the fallout of having caught his wife in bed with another man, and a mysterious malfunction in the lighting system (allegedly one deliberately created by an Orioles employee) forced the cancellation of the game and thereby preserved Ripken’s streak.

  A game between the Orioles and the Seattle Mariners scheduled for
  <nobr>
   14 August
  </nobr>
  1997 was cancelled due to lighting problems, but there was nothing “mysterious” about the incident.  A ground fault interrupt kept tripping the circuit breaker each time the lights in the right-field bank were turned on, and the game’s
  <nobr>
   7:35 P.M.
  </nobr>
  starting time was pushed back as a crew worked on the problem.  (That the businesses surrounding Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore did not experience similar problems is not strange, as Oriole Park is on a separate portion of the city’s power grid.)  The crew finally got the right-field bank of lights working by
  <nobr>
   8:45 P.M.,
  </nobr>
  but about
  <nobr>
   20 bulbs
  </nobr>
  in the bank failed to illuminate, and the umpiring crew had to make the decision whether to allow the game to begin.  Umpire crew chief Al Clark finally postponed the game at
  <nobr>
   10 P.M.
  </nobr>
  after determining that shadows at home plate created unsafe playing conditions, a decision that was influenced by the fact that fireballing pitcher Randy Johnson was scheduled to start for the Mariners.  Given that Johnson was a left-hander who threw extremely hard, and the lighting outage occurred on the first-base side of the field (i.e., the side on which batters would be visually picking up the ball from Johnson’s hand as the southpaw threw towards home plate), the risk of serious injury to a batter was deemed too great to allow the game to proceed.  The contest was cancelled and made up as part of a double-header the following day.

 <p>
  Shortly afterwards, a conspiracy rumor was concocted from this scenario which involved actor Kevin Costner, who had a long-standing friendship with Cal Ripken, and rumors of marital difficulties between Ripken and his wife Kelly.  According to that rumor, Ripken caught Costner in bed with his wife on the morning of
  <nobr>
   14 August
  </nobr>
  1997, and the shock of that betrayal left Ripken too emotionally distraught and/or too sore and bruised from brawling with Costner to show up at Camden Yards for the Orioles’ game with the Seattle Mariners that evening.  (Some versions of the legend even maintain that Ripken couldn’t make it to the ballpark because he had been hauled off to jail for assault.)  In order to preserve the tremendous publicity value of Ripken’s consecutive game steak, Orioles management quickly arranged for someone in the Camden Yards facilities crew to create a ‘malfunction’ that would prevent the day’s game from coming off as scheduled and providing Ripken with a much-needed day off to recover from his ordeal.
