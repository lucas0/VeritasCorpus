  the above-displayed image on Facebook, along with an accusation that Donald Trump’s campaign was seeking a Latina actress to play the candidate’s executive assistant.

  While the casting call is legitimate, there is no evidence connecting it to Donald Trump’s campaign.  The original

  , which was first published on LACasting.com on 1 March 2016, does not identify who placed the ad.

  This casting call is not for someone to play Donald Trump’s executive assistant on the campaign trail. Rather, this is for a scripted role for a YouTube video, that apparently is intended to “go viral”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   We need a Hispanic female actress that can pretend to play Donald Trump’s Executive Assistant for this Viral Video. You will be speaking directly to the camera about your experience working for him. This is scripted.
  </p>
  <p>
   […]
  </p>
  <p>
   Need someone that is comfortable playing a Mexican Trump Supporter. You will be acting like his ex executive assistant, and will be talking directly to the camera. Lots of dialogue and script to memorize.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  It seems unlikely that the ad was placed by Donald Trump’s campaign, as this casting call at one point calls for an actress to play his “ex executive assistant.” This verbiage could be a typo, but more likely indicates that this video is part of an anti-Trump campaign, not a pro-Trump one.
