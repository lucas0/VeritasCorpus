  The image is real, but has nothing to do with Nazis or antifascist protesters. It is part of a street art series by artist

    Street art experimenter Rallitox treads the fine lines of art and sociology and behavioral studies – often provoking passersby into participating in his works even passively – like staging a crime scene with a grocery store chicken and some ketchup on a sidewalk, or inviting people to walk across the backs of 8 people lying on their stomachs as a free opportunity to walk on immigrants. If it doesn’t delve into sensationalism, this kind of work has the power to focus the view on your role as participant only by virtue of inhabiting a public space.
