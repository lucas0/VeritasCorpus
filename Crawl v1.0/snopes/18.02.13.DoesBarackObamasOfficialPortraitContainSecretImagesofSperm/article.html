  posted on the web site of Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity breathlessly reported:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The widening scandal surrounding former President Barack Obama’s official portrait continued to swirl on Tuesday, with shocking allegations the artist included ‘secret sperm cells’ within the painting and once joked about “Killing Whitey” during an interview.
