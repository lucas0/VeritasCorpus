 <p>
  A popular Chinese restaurant in Pretoria has been granted permission to sell Dog Meat to its customers.
 </p>
 <p>
  The restaurant successfully argued that the banning of consuming dog meat, which they pointed out, is in violation of their religious and cultural rights.

 <p>
  The restaurant has been granted provisional permission to slaughter, sell and consume dog meat, while awaiting the Supreme Court’s final decision of their case. The restaurant is allowed to slaughter up to 35 dogs per week, under the conditions that the dogs are killed properly and humanely.
