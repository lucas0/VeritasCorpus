  An Iowa teacher at Kensington elementary school has been suspended from her functions after allegedly sitting on a student’s head and farting in his mouth leaving him gasping for air.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 34-year-old teacher, Ann Margaret DeVille, apparently wanted to teach the student a valuable lesson after the young man allegedly made a public comment on her “ugly fat ass.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “She pushed him to the ground, lifted her robe and just sat her ass on his face and then just let out the biggest fart in front of all his classmates,” she added.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He was gasping for air. He thought he was going to die,” explained the victim’s mother to reporters.
