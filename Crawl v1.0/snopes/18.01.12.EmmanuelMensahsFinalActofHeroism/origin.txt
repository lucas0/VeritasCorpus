  Private Mensah was found in Apartment 15, his uncle said, but he lived in Apartment 11, with a friend of his fatherâ€™s who was at home with his wife and four children. [He] got that family to safety, then pulled out four more people, his uncle said, before returning to the building. He never emerged; the authorities said he died of smoke inhalation.
