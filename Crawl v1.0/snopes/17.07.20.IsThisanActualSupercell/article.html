  This footage did not show a “live” video of a storm; the biggest giveaway is that the storm did not move from its original location at any time during the four-hour-long stream.
 </p>
 <p>
  The main reason for the storm’s static appearance, of course, is that this footage is actually based on a photograph — taken by storm chaser and photographer Marko Korosec — of a supercell near Murdo, South Dakota on 19 June 2015.

    The photogenic part of severe storms. This amazing tornadic supercell was the best I’ve seen so far at nighttime, nicely illuminated with intracloud lightning, layered and striated with rough wind power! June 19th, 2015 near Murdo, South Dakota.
