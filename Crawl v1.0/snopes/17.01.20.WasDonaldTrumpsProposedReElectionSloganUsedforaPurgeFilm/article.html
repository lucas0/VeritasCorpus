  of Donald Trump and his campaign slogan “Make America Great Again” included a portion in which Trump mentioned that he planned to use “Keep America Great” as a campaign slogan for a 2020 re-election bid:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Halfway through his interview with The Washington Post, Trump shared a bit of news: He already has decided on his slogan for a reelection bid in 2020.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Are you ready?” he said. “ ‘Keep America Great,’ exclamation point.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “Get me my lawyer!” the president-elect shouted.
  </p>
  <p>
   Two minutes later, one arrived.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Will you trademark and register, if you would, if you like it — I think I like it, right? Do this: ‘Keep America Great,’ with an exclamation point. With and without an exclamation. ‘Keep America Great,’ ” Trump said.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Got it,” the lawyer replied.
  </p>
  <p>
   That bit of business out of the way, Trump returned to the interview.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Many social media users who spotted this tidbit pointed out that the phrase had already been prominently used back in 2016 as part of the marketing for
  <em>
   The Purge: Election Year
  </em>
  , an installment of the dystopian
  <em>
   Purge
  </em>
  film series.

   reported

  on the then-upcoming film and noted its obvious nod to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   You’d also have to be blind to not see how the team behind
   <em>
    The Purge: Election Year
   </em>
   is taking shots at Donald Trump’s political campaign. Trump’s motto through his campaign has been “make America great again”, even putting it on snazzy baseball caps.
   <strong>
    And now the message of this fake pro-purge spot is “keep America great”.
   </strong>
   While Donald Trump will presumably not pass a legalized murder act if elected President, surely the team behind
   <em>
    The Purge
   </em>
   must not think too highly of the Republican frontrunner since they’ve created such a similar slogan.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The slogan was visible at the end of a trailer for the film published on YouTube on 25 February 2016:

  In the context of the original
  <em>
   Washington Post
  </em>
  article, it appeared Trump’s idea to use “Keep America Great” was an in-the-moment inspiration without his awareness of its associations with a recent horror film release, making the slogan an unlikely choice should President Trump opt to seek re-election in 2020.
