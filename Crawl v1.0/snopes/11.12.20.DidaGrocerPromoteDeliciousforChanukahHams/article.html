  A humorous photograph of a store’s purportedly advertising “Delicious for Chanukah” hams (humorous, of course, because Chanukah is a Jewish holiday, and Jewish dietary laws forbid the consumption of pork products) has been circulated every December since 2007, with accompanying text identifying the hapless ham vendor as anything from an outlet of the Walmart mega-chain to “a grocery store in Texas.”

   spotted the kosher faux pas while browsing the meat section [on December 1] at the chain’s outpost at Eighth Ave. and W. 14th St.

   Shapiro said that when she went back to the store [on 4 December], the first night of Chanukah, the signs had vanished.

   about the error he didn’t want to speak on the record. He fessed up that “it was a mistake,” blaming it on a stock clerk who normally doesn’t work the meat department.
