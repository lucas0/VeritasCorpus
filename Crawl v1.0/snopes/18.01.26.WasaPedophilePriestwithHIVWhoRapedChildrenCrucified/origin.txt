  A pedophile priest, who was found guilty of raping 30 children while infected with HIV but forgiven by the Vatican, has been found dead outside his church.
 </p>
 <p>
  Earlier this year, Catholic priest Jose Garcia Ataulfo admitted to raping 30 young girls aged between 5 and 10 years old in Oaxaca, Southern Mexico.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ataulfo was cleared of any wrong-doing by the church and didnâ€™t face any criminal charges, despite the fact that he knew he was infected with HIV when he sexually abused all the children he is known to have raped.
