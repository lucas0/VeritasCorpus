  Choir practice at the West Side Baptist Church in Beatrice, Nebraska, always began at 7:20 on Wednesday evening. At

  1950, an explosion demolished the church. The blast forced a nearby radio station off the air and shattered windows in surrounding homes.

  But every one of the choir’s fifteen members escaped injury, saved by a fortuitous coincidence: All were late for practice that night. Considering the sanctified site of the explosion, it was not surprising that some attributed the near miss to divine intervention.

 <p>
  They supposed rightly that the odds of unanimous tardiness were slim indeed, especially when the reasons were examined. Car trouble delayed two women. The minister and his wife and daughter were delayed by a dress that needed ironing at the last minute. Others were late because they paused to complete homework, finish a letter, or hear the end of a favorite radio show. One awoke late from a nap. Some could think of no special reason; they were just late.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is impossible to calculate precise odds for all these events occurring at once. But past performance indicated that each person would be late for practice one time in four — producing a one-in-a-million chance that the entire choir would be late that night.
