  Here is a weird thing that is totally real: when someone screams out their window in Sweden, Sweden screams right back.

  Responding to a scream with a scream isn’t exactly what one would consider proper protocol … but when you live in the IKEA nation it’s just how things are done. They’re not inconsiderate prickigs (those are microwave covers), they’re just following tradition, and it is called The Flogsta Scream.

  Yeah, screaming into the dark of night isn’t a source of unsettlement, it’s a point of pride … The Flogsta Scream is one of those totally legitimate Swedish things that makes no sense to outsiders such as us.
