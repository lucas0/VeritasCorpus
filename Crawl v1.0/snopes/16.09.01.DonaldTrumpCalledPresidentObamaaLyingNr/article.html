  It is hardly a secret that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has made some racially-charged comments since he announced his White House bid. In fact, he infamously launched his presidential campaign in 2015 by calling Mexican people (among other things) criminals.

 <p>
  Trump has also made a virtual avalanche of negative comments about President Barack Obama, some of which have no doubt been racially derogatory — including questioning his American citizenship. In one instance in July 2016, Trump implied Russian president Vladimir Putin had used the

   slur
  </a>
  against Obama — a claim for which there is no proof.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless, on 8 August 2016, a web site that appears to be dedicated to nothing but generating fake news stories published a piece saying that Trump called Obama the racial slur after a strange back-and-forth, for which there is no record.

  claimed that Trump called Obama a Muslim and then the two had a confrontation, during which the racial slur was flung.

  also claimed that this exchange resulted in a lawsuit over whether Trump is qualified to be president due to his racism. (Needless to say, the site didn’t provide any source citations or video for this alleged exchange.) The web site also has headlines claiming Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will

  between the U.S. and Mexico — even though the 2016 election has yet to be decided.

  There are no other publications that documented what by all measures would be explosive news that would, if true, dominate the news cycle. While there has been much discussion over Trump’s views on ethnicity, including the fact that he has the support of known white supremacist David Duke, there is no proof that Trump called the first African-American president such an incendiary word.
