  This time, a tweeter shared a photo of a groom being held up by his four groomsmen as he kissed his bride.”He’s paralyzed, but his friends held him up to get married ?? Those are real friends ???,” @EllaBandzzz tweeted, as she posted the moving photo … posted on 11th December, is so touching that it’s been retweeted nearly 1.5 thousand times, and has over 1,000 Likes.
