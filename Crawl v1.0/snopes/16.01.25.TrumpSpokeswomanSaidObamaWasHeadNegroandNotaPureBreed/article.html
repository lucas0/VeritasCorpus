  Pierson (unconvincingly) defended the message in question to Stelter, claiming that she had been called a “half-breed” herself:

   “I’m an activist and I am a half-breed. I’m always getting called a half-breed. On Twitter when you’re fighting with liberals and even establishment, you go back at them in the same silliness they are giving you.”

  Although Pierson did post the messages in question to Twitter, she did so at least two years before she

  Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, not while she was actively working as his spokesperson.
