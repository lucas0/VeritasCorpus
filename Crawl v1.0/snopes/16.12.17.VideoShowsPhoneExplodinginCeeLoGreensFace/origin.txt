  “Actually what you saw today was a clip from a smaller video that we were shooting for a new project I’m doing called Gnarley Davidson, and it’s supposed to set up and introduce the new character identity, you know what I’m saying? And you know, forgive me y’all. I’m still going to release the music, but first and foremost, for everybody that loves me and cares about me, I just want to let y’all know that I’m okay.”
