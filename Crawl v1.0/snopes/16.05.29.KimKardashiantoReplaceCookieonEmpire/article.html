  On 25 May 2015, the entertainment web site
  <em>
   Witty Feed
  </em>
  published an article reporting that reality show star Kim Kardashian was replacing Tarji P. Henson in the role of “Cookie” on the popular
  <br>
   Fox musical drama television series
   <em>
    Empire
   </em>
   :
  </br>
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   It will come as a surprise to most of the Fox’s hit drama ’empire’ that they have decided to replace the character “cookie” which is played by Emmay award-nominated, Tarji P. Henson. The leading lady for the show which is in the talks for the role is none other than reality TV star Kim Kardashian.

  There is no truth to this rumor.
  <em>
   Witty Feed
  </em>
  is a blogging platform that lets anyone create their own stories with little oversight. The above-quoted article, for instance, was based on a fake news article that was published in July 2015 on the web site
  <em>
   Read Talk Share
  </em>
  , which includes
  <br/>
  a disclaimer identifying all of the site’s content as fiction:

  Fox has made no announcements about replacing Henson with a new actress for the upcoming third season of
  <em>
   Empire
  </em>
  . In fact, Henson has been heavily featured in the show’s social media promotions:
