   In October 2016, a story cropped up about a 47-year-old man who ate a ghost pepper and then went to the hospital with a one-inch tear in his esophagus. The story was picked up by numerous media outlets from a

   That makes ghost peppers sound particularly dangerous, and in all fairness India’s bhut jolokia, popularly known as the ghost pepper, is one of the hottest peppers in the world. It burns up most of the competition on the Scoville heat scale, landing somewhere in the range of 1 million units, depending on growth and testing methods.

    suffering

  </a>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   from “nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and burning diarrhea” produced by ingesting ghost peppers. There’s no question that ghost peppers really, really burn.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   But can they burn or tear holes in you?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   To answer, we first need to take a look at
  </span>
  <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Capsaicin" target="_blank">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    capsaicin
   </span>
  </a>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   , the active ingredient in hot chili peppers. This compound is found in the highest concentration

   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    seeds
   </span>
  </a>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   inside the pepper. Indeed, ingesting capsaicin will certainly make you feel like you’re on fire on the inside, but there is no actual burning taking place.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   That’s why capsaicin is classified as an irritant — it doesn’t literally burn you, it simply produces the sensation of burning. In fact, capsaicin is used as an ingredient in analgesics (painkillers); in low concentrations, it has the

  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   of soothing pain from arthritis and other chronic conditions and has been

  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   to promote gastric protection.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   Notably, capsaicin plays an important role in the reproductive cycle of chili peppers. The burn is a defense mechanism. Ghost peppers, and in fact all chili peppers that “burn” with capsaicin, are simply
  </span>

 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    The primary function of ripe, fleshy fruit is to facilitate seed dispersal by attracting consumers, yet many fruits contain unpleasant-tasting chemicals that deter consumption by vertebrates. Here we investigate this paradox in the chili (Capsicum) and find that capsaicin, the chemical responsible for the fruit’s peppery heat, selectively discourages vertebrate predators without deterring more effective seed dispersers.

   Lately there’s been a spate of

   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    YouTube videos
   </span>
  </a>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   portraying people who eat ghost peppers for the challenge of it. Most recover pretty quickly after a bout with a ghost pepper, but every once in a while there’s a nasty side effect. That’s what happened with the aforementioned 47-year-old.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   As most of the sensationalized stories will admit if you read past the headline, that man experienced a rare surgical emergency called spontaneous esophageal perforation, which according to the National Institutes of Health is also
  </span>
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3589863/" target="_blank">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    known
   </span>
  </a>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   as Boerhaave syndrome:
  </span>
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    Boerhaave syndrome (BS) is a very rare surgical emergency, most usually diagnosed in men aged 50-70 years after heavy meal ingestion combined with abundant alcohol consumption. … The pathogenesis involves sudden pressure increase caused by forceful vomiting against a closed glottis because of incomplete cricopharyngeal relaxation.
   </span>
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   In other words, if vomit can’t take the front door because your throat muscles are locked up, it will find another way out. The man in question had
  </span>
  <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/man-eats-hot-pepper-burns-hole-in-esophagus/" target="_blank">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    eaten
   </span>
  </a>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   a burger topped with ghost pepper purée, but it was the resulting complications — not the ghost pepper itself — that led to the perforation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   In conclusion, ghost peppers can’t burn, rip, tear, or give you a hole in your esophagus, or any other body part. Or anything at all, for that matter.
