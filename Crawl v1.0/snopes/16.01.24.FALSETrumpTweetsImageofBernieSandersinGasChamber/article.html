  On 22 January 2016, the
  <em>
   Jewish Daily Forward
  </em>
  published an
  <a href="http://forward.com/opinion/331449/that-time-donald-trump-retweeted-nazis/" target="_blank">
   editorial
  </a>
  titled “Donald Trump Retweets Creator of Pic Showing Bernie Sanders Sent to Gas Chamber”; the title of the item was edited at an indeterminate point after it was published.
  <!--The headline, which attempted to truncate the events it referenced into a concise summary, led to a larger mistaken belief Trump himself tweeted an image of him sending Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders (who is Jewish) to a gas chamber.-->
 </p>
 <p>
  Confusion about the claim (evidenced in the examples reproduced above)
  <!--stemmed from nuance absent from social media headlines due to an effort to create a manageable title. That said, the <em>Jewish Daily Forward</em> title was somewhat clear and never directly stated (nor appeared to imply) that Trump had directly tweeted the image in question.-->
  may have resulted from what was a clumsy initial headline, the original preserved in early social media shares of the page:

  As the embedded links initially demonstrated, the piece was originally titled “Donald Trump Retweets Pic Showing Him Sending Bernie Sanders to Gas Chamber.” What Trump
  <strong>
   had
  </strong>
  done was to tweet a completely different image (featuring GOP rival Jeb Bush) created by the same account responsible for the “gas chamber” image, but he hadn’t directly retweeted the Holocaust-inspired graphic:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Trump’s official Twitter feed retweeted this Tweet that takes a jab at GOP rival Jeb Bush. It shows a photoshopped image of Bush in front of the Trump Towers, holding up a “Vote for Trump” sign.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seems innocuous enough. Until you see the account it’s retweeted from: @WhiteGenocideTM.
  </p>
  <p>
   But that’s not even the worst of it. A @WhiteGenocideTM photoshop creation shows Trump in a Nazi uniform flipping on the gas switch on a gas chamber housing… Jewish candidate Bernie Sanders.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The editorial asserted that Trump’s ostensible re-tweeting of material from an account populated largely by racist and anti-Semitic material was perhaps troubling. However, the chain of responsibility for the re-tweet remained a matter of dispute, as the Trump tweet in question occurred nine days after the offensive “gas chamber” image was reportedly first published by @WhiteGenocideTM. Whether Trump was even aware such an image previously appeared on @WhiteGenocideTM’s timeline was unclear and perhaps improbable.
 </p>
 <p>
  We attempted to validate the existence of the original 13 January 2016 “gas chamber” tweet on @WhiteGenocideTM’s Twitter feed, but if it had once been published there, it was deleted at some point prior 24 January 2016.
  <em>

  shared a screenshot of the purported tweet, however:

  A significant amount of scrolling was required to ascertain that the reported tweet from 13 January 2016 was no longer available. However, the account in question did primarily publish material of a similar bent, and Trump’s 22 January 2016 re-tweet remained intact:

  As the
  <em>
   Jewish Daily Forward
  </em>
  piece stated, Donald Trump re-tweeted an unrelated, photoshopped image (of Jeb Bush holding a “Vote Trump” sign outside Trump Tower in New York City) on 22 January 2016. The article’s original headline suggested that Trump re-tweeted an image of himself placing rival Bernie Sanders in a gas chamber, but it was later changed (without an editor’s note explaining the significant modification). Due to the nature and timing of re-tweets, it’s likely Trump was unaware of the nature of the account from which the image originated.
