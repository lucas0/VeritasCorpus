  On 14 July 2016, social media users shared links reporting that Ted Cruz said he would endorse Donald Trump for president if the latter promised to make masturbation illegal:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) sent shockwaves through the Republican Party today when he announced that he would endorse Donald Trump for President, but only if the GOP nominee would be willing to publicly support a ban on masturbation.

   In an interview on Capitol Hill with MSNBC’s Hallie Jackson, Cruz wouldn’t offer a timeline on when he’ll make a decision on whether or not to support the GOP nominee, offering only that he was “giving it time, watching and assessing.”

   “I, like many other voters am watching and listening what he says and what he does,” Cruz said. “That’s what millions of voters are doing. That’s the way the democratic process is meant to operate.”
