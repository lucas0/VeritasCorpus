  Since the 1990s, eligible voters in the country of Mexico (i.e., persons of age 18 or greater) have had  to visit an electoral office and be registered into the electoral census in order to obtain a voting card issued by the National Electoral Institute (formerly the Federal Electoral Institute).  Those voting cards are government-issued photo IDs, credentials that citizens are required to produce at polling stations in order to vote in federal elections in Mexico.

  The United States has no equivalent national voter requirements or voter ID card, however.  Some

   states

  require voters to produce photo IDs in order to vote, while others don’t.  And even the states that do require photo IDs may still allow voters lacking them to use other means of documenting their identities and/or to cast provisional ballots.

 <p>
  These differences are often cited in opinion pieces (like the meme displayed above) questioning why, if Mexico requires its citizens to produce federally-issued photo ID cards in order to vote, the United States can’t or shouldn’t do the same in order to crack down on voter fraud.  On the other side, critics of voter ID card plans maintain there are a number of reasons why what is used in Mexico isn’t necessarily a feasible solution or a panacea for the United States:

     Voter ID cards were part of reforms enacted in Mexico in the 1990s because that country had a long history of institutionalized electoral fraud and corruption, to the point that many citizens no longer trusted the electoral process nor had faith in the organization created to oversee federal elections:

   During 71 years of uninterrupted Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) rule, which ended in 2000, electoral crooks known as
   <em>
    Mapaches
   </em>
   , or raccoons, went about stuffing and stealing ballot boxes. Stories also abound of PRI operatives plying poor voters with sandwiches and soft drinks and then escorting the recently fed to the polling stations.

   Mexican officials unveiled the voting ID to properly identify electors in a country with a history of voters casting multiple ballots and curious vote counts resulting in charges of fraud — most notoriously in 1988 when a computer crash wiped out early results favoring the opposition.

   The credential’s widespread acceptance deepened democracy by giving credibility to the Federal Electoral Institute, analysts say. The agency was created as an independent agency to oversee federal elections.

   “It’s a very important prop for support of that institution,” said Federico EstÃ©vez, political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. “What people really know about (the electoral institute) is the card.”
