  Does the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an American bastion of serious scientific research with dozens of Nobel laureates among its alumni, really offer its over-achieving students something called a “Pirate Certificate”?
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s the claim that the History Hustle Facebook page makes in a widely-shared January 2018
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HistoryHustle/posts/2005945169675466" target="_blank">
   meme
  </a>
  that reads:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Want to be a pirate? Massachusetts Institute of Technology awards official “Pirate Certificates” to students who complete courses in archery, pistol shooting, sailing and fencing.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  It’s true. Since the Fall semester of 2011, the university’s Physical Education
  <a href="http://mitpe.mit.edu/Pirate-Certificate/" target="_blank">
   department
  </a>
  has been handing out physical “pirate certificates” to any student — undergraduate or graduate — who has successfully completed courses in archery, fencing, pistol/rifle shooting and sailing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The department appears to hold frequent “Pirate Induction” days; and its Facebook page shows a fairly steady stream of extremely happy-looking MIT
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mitpe/photos/" target="_blank">
   students
  </a>
  showing off their new pirate certificates, invariably dressed in pirate garb, some of which appears to be provided by the school for the occasion.
 </p>
 <p>
  The certificate itself is made of “faux parchment,” according to the Slice of MIT alumni
  <a href="https://alum.mit.edu/slice/arrrrr-mit-pirates-certified" target="_blank">
   blog
  </a>
  , and has this tongue-in-cheek wording:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   This document certifies that the below-mentioned salty dog has fulfilled the Physical Education General Institute Requirement by completing Archery, Fencing, Pistol and Sailing [and] therefore is no longer a lily-livered landlubber. And so, MIT Physical Education Confers upon [STUDENT’S NAME] The Pirate Certificate, with all its privileges and obligations. Given at the swashbucklin’ Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   <br>
    Ahoy, Avast and finally, Arrrrrr!
   </br>
