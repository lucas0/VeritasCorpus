  Crayola does accept spent markers for recycling through their ColorCycle program — but, according to their

   web site
  </a>
  , the program is only open to schools in the “contiguous 48 United States and some areas in Canada.” Individual Crayola customers aren’t eligible to send their markers directly to Crayola for recycling, but the program included printable posters for school drop-off points.

  And although homeschoolers were not yet eligible to participate, Crayola stated they were “hoping to roll out the program to include home schools, daycares and preschools in the future.”

  The ColorCycle program was

   launched

  in August 2013 as a partnership with JBI, Inc. The idea is to convert the used markers, which are not easily recycled, into liquid fuel.
