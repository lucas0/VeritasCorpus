<blockquote>
 <p>
  In an Oval Office ceremony on [18 October 2016], President Barack Obama signed an executive order requiring the loser of the 2016 Presidential election to leave the country forever … The executive order calls for the loser of the November 8th election to depart the country on the morning of November 9th and never return.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Whoever that turns out to be,” the President said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Obama acknowledged that the executive order marked a departure from American electoral tradition, but added, “A lot of good will come of this.”
