  Vann Capps, a Customs official in Miami, said he heard the story in a 1973 training course for inspectors at Hofstra University. “They gave us different concealment techniques from past seizures, and this one involved cocaine concealed in the dead baby’s body,” Capps said. He said he believes the incident was alleged to have occurred at either the Miami airport or the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.
