  In November 2017, social media users encountered an image that ostensibly replicated a post from the “AR-15 Gun Owners of America” Facebook page, showing two photographs of a small child holding a handgun with text indicating the child had just had to put down the family dog due to barking complaints:

  The image appeared to be a bit of satire or dark humor playing on the ongoing debate in the U.S. about gun issues (and specifically private ownership of magazine-fed, semi-automatic rifles such as the AR-15), which many viewers found disturbing in light of recent mass shootings at a Las Vegas concert and a Texas church.

  The photographs clearly had no connection to the backstory that accompanied them (about a boy’s shooting his dog), as they originated with the Shutterstock stock photography service:

  In fact, these pictures depict a Russian photographer’s three-year-old son playing with a toy gun, which the father captured with a camera and licensed as stock photos:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In his essay at The Guardian, Kelly asks the big question: Why do these [dark stock images] exist [at Shutterstock]?
  </p>
  <p>
   “Who is buying them? And to illustrate what?” he writes. “A few may have been slipped in by a photographer as a joke, but I get the sense that most of them were taken in earnest.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking for answers, BuzzFeed reached out and talked to some of the photographers behind the dark stock images, including Russian photographer Sergey Komisar, whose photos  of his three-year-old son Roman holding a toy handgun and weeping have been an unexpected hit. “It was a sweet moment, and one I didn’t want to miss. So I asked him to pose as he was,” Komisar says.
