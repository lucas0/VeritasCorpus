  On 14 June 2016, the unreliable web site
  <em>
   Powdered Wig Society
  </em>
  <a href="http://archive.is/8EhlB/image" target="_blank">
   reported
  </a>
  that a photograph showed Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen’s father visiting “Hillary Clinton’s office”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I really have to wonder about this.
  </p>
  <p>
   The father of the Orlando mass murderer has been a frequent visitor to Washington. He has had several meetings with Hitlery Clinton’s State Department.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seddique Mateen, pictured below, is also a candidate for President of Afghanistan. Hmmmm.
  </p>
  <p>
   Is it not plausible that Seddique encouraged his son’s evil act to drum up overwhelming support amongst the very anti-American Afghan electorate in an effort to win the presidential election? Just sayin’.
  </p>

 <p>
  The article included the image, captioned with a claim that Seddique Mateen was “visiting Hillary Clinton’s office,” speculating that he had encouraged his son’s death to further his own political ambitions:

  It’s true that the image was not in widespread circulation until after the 12 June 2016 Orlando Pulse shooting, but false that Mateen was shown “visiting Hillary Clinton’s office.” The photograph was among more than a dozen

   published

  by the British tabloid
  <em>
   Daily Mail,
  </em>
  and its caption indicated that the images were taken in April 2016 (years after Clinton vacated the office of Secretary of State in 2013):

  The implication Mateen had ties to Hillary Clinton was clear in the caption, but easily proved false. In April 2016 John Kerry served as Secretary of State, and Clinton was busy working on her presidential campaign.

 <blockquote>

   The Afghan-born father of Omar Mateen, the man police identified as the gunman who killed 50 people at a packed gay nightclub in Florida on Sunday, is a fringe political commentator who rails against Pakistan and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seddique Mateen, who public records indicate is the father of Omar Mateen, had an occasional television show on a U.S.-based Afghan satellite channel for about three years, and has continued to post political commentaries on his Facebook page as recently as Sunday.
