  The notion that President Obama ceased sporting a wedding band and wristwatch in observance of a supposed proscription against wearing jewelry during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan is one that can be definitively debunked on many levels. To wit:

    Islam has no general prohibition against Muslims’ wearing jewelry during the month of Ramadan.

    (because, according to the White House, it had been sent out for repair) for a few days in mid-September 2010, at the very end of Ramadan. If President Obama had truly removed his wedding band as part of a Ramadan observance, he would had to have shed it in mid-August and refrained from wearing it for four full weeks afterwards.

   Although President Obama is not a frequent public church-goer (due to his “concern that his presence and the exhaustive security precautions required before and during the worship could prove disruptive for other congregants”), the claim that he “hasn’t gone to a Christian church service since entering the White House” is false. The Obamas have attended public church services in Washington on several occasions (see, for example, “

   The suggestion that the Obamas spent their Christmas vacation in Hawaii so that President Obama could avoid scrutiny for not attending church is also false. In fact, the Obamas

    Update:

  In August 2011 the claim that President Obama was not wearing his watch or wedding ring in observance of Ramadan was circulated anew. Ramadan in 2011 lasted from 1 August to 29 August, yet photographs from that period clearly show the President wearing both his wedding ring and his watch (e.g., the
