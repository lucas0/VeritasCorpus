  of an altercation between a musician and a street vendor in Los Angeles went viral, generating outrage and a discussion about the effects of gentrification, a dubious Spanish-language web site published a fabricated story about the aftermath.

   police quickly took notice of Carlos Hakas after he flipped Benjamín Ramírez’s cart during the 17 July 2017 encounter. The site “cited” the

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   As the Los Angeles Times reported on its website, a warrant was generated and 40-year-old Argentinian Carlos Hakas was arrested at a Hot Dog’s restaurant located at 709 N. La Brea Ave., in Los Angeles, California.
  </p>
  <p>
   …
  </p>
  <p>
   In a statement, immigration officials said that they will seek identifying documents and the Argentinian consulate’s cooperation in the deportation of Carlos A. Hakas once the judicial process against him has ended.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  While there is a Pink’s Hot Dogs restaurant located at that address, authorities have not made any statement indicating that they are pursuing deportation proceedings against Hakas. (

  While Hakas may not have drawn the attention of immigration officials, police are looking into possible vandalism charges against him in connection with the encounter, which was

   reportedly
  </a>
  viewed millions of times after Ramírez’s mother posted the footage on Facebook on 24 July 2017.
 </p>
 <p>
  The video begins with Hakas — seen initially holding a dog on a leash ordering Ramírez to move his cart from a street corner in Hollywood. When Ramírez refuses, Hakas hands off the dog to a woman identified as his girlfriend Holly Corvella before pushing the cart over, sending his

  </a>
  — a Mexican variation of corn on the cob —  spilling into the concrete.
 </p>
 <p>
  Corvella is then heard telling Ramírez, “Don’t you fucking try it. Stay the fuck away.” He replies in Spanish, “I don’t give a shit. I’m not moving from here.” Ramírez then points his phone camera toward himself and says:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   This faggot racist came to dump this. He came to dump this. Idiot.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Seconds later, Hakas replies, “I’m not a racist, idiot” before saying in Spanish:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I’m not a racist, I’m Argentinian, you retard.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Ramírez has said that Hakas was brandishing a stun gun during the encounter. While the musician can be seen holding a pink object, it is unclear what it is. Police confirmed to us on 28 July 2017 that they are still investigating the incident.

  Meanwhile, Ramírez has won a groundswell of public support after the video spread online. Cartoonists

   raised
  </a>
  $7,800 —  exceeding its initial goal by $6,800.
 </p>
 <p>
  While he may not be facing deportation, Los Angeles police are in fact investigating possible vandalism charges against Hakas over the altercation.
