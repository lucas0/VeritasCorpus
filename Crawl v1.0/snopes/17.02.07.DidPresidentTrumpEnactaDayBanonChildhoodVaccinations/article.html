  On 6 February 2017, the Houston Leader web site published an
  <a href="http://archive.is/GxMkN/image" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  reporting that President Trump had enacted a 90-day ban on childhood vaccinations via executive order:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Late [on the] afternoon [of 6 February 2017] President Trump announced what may be one of his most controversial decisions to date when he signed an executive order placing a temporary 90-day ban on all childhood MMR (measles/mumps/rubella) vaccinations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The executive order will require all pediatric doctors to refuse the administration of MMR vaccinations in all of their patients under the age of 18-years-old for the next 90-days or risk losing their medical license.
  </p>
  <p>
   Additionally, the executive order implements a mandatory freeze on all MMR vaccinations from pharmaceutical distributors to health care professionals during these 90-days.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The articles included screenshots of two genuine tweets critical of vaccinations that were posted by President Trump years prior to his run for the presidency:

   Healthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn’t feel good and changes – AUTISM. Many such cases!

  Although the tweets were legitimate, the article’s claim was not. President Trump’s purported signing of a “90-day ban on childhood vaccinations” would constitute a highly newsworthy development, yet not a single additional source reported any such order was signed. And the site on which it was hosted was only recently established, one major hallmark of fake news sites:
