  On Thursday, May 27, 1999, Darrell Scott, the father of Rachel Scott, a victim of the Columbine High School shootings in Littleton, Colorado, was invited to address the House Judiciary Committee’s sub-committee. What he said to our national leaders during this special session of Congress was painfully truthful. They were not prepared for what he was to say, nor was it received well. It needs to be heard by every parent, every teacher, every politician, every sociologist, every psychologist, and every

  expert! These courageous words spoken by Darrell Scott are powerful, penetrating, and deeply personal. There is no doubt that God sent this man as a voice crying in the wilderness. The following is a portion of the transcript:

  Since the dawn of creation there has been both good and evil in the hearts of men and women. We all contain the seeds of kindness or the seeds of violence.
 </p>
 <p>
  The death of my wonderful daughter, Rachel Joy Scott, and the deaths of that heroic teacher and the other eleven children who died must not be in vain. Their blood cries out for answers.

  The first recorded act of violence was when Cain slew his brother Abel out in the field. The villain was not the club he used. Neither was it the NCA, the National Club Association. The true killer was Cain, and the reason for the murder could only be found in Cain’s heart.

  In the days that followed the Columbine tragedy, I was amazed at how quickly fingers began to be pointed at groups such as the NRA. I am not a member of the NRA.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am not a hunter. I do not even own a gun. I am not here to represent or defend the NRA — because I don’t believe that they are responsible for my daughter’s death.  Therefore I do not believe they need to be defended. If I believed they had anything to do with Rachel’s murder I would be their strongest opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am here today to declare that Columbine was not just a tragedy — it was a spiritual event that should be forcing us to look at where the real blame lies!
 </p>
 <p>
  Much of the blame lies here in this room. Much of the blame lies behind the pointing fingers of the accusers themselves.

  I wrote a poem just four nights ago that expresses my feelings best. This was written way before I knew I would be speaking here today:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Your laws ignore our deepest needs
   <br>
    Your words are empty air
    <br/>
    You’ve stripped away our heritage
    <br/>
    You’ve outlawed simple prayer
   </br>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Now gunshots fill our classrooms
  <br/>
  And precious children die
  <br/>
  You seek for answers everywhere
  <br/>
  And ask the question “Why”?
 </p>
 <p>
  You regulate restrictive laws
  <br/>
  Through legislative creed
  <br/>
  And yet you fail to understand
  <br/>
  That God is what we need
 </p>
