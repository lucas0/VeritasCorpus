    A spokesperson for the Berlin Police Workers’ Party, told Bild : “The incident shows in a brutal and shocking way how quickly everyone in every city in this city can become a victim of senseless violence.

  While the attacker was not identified in the original report, several web sites picked up on the video and shared it along with the claim — which was apparently made up and shared with the video without any proof or corroborating information at all — that it showed a Muslim immigrant kicking a woman down the stairs.
