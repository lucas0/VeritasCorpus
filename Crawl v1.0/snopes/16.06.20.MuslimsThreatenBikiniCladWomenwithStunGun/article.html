  On 19 June 2016, the anti-Islam watch group “Our Eye on Islam” posted a video on YouTube purportedly showing two Muslim men threatening a group of people with a stun gun at a pool in Florida after they were angered by glimpsing women in bikinis:

  However, several aspects of this footage seemingly contradict “Our Eye on Islam’s” claims about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s impossible to tell whether or not the man holding the gun is Muslim. At no point in the video does he utter anything related to Islam, nor do any of the “victims” in the video accuse him of being Muslim. “Our Eye On Islam” may have made this assumption due to the presence of a cloaked figure that is assumed to be a woman in a burqa but is clearly an inanimate object concealed by a pool cover (as it remains motionless throughout the video):
