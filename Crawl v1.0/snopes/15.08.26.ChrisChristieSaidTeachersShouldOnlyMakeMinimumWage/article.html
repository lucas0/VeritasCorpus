   published
  </a>
  a fake news article reporting that New Jersey governor (and Republican presidential hopeful) Chris Christie said that teachers were overpaid and should make minimum wage plus a bonus based on the number of students who pass standardized tests:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “Teachers are paid too much, that’s what’s bankrupting the system,” Christie said. “Some teachers make six-figure salaries and that’s not including retirement benefits.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Christie suggested a new teacher pay structure. He proposed teachers get paid minimum wage and a bonus for every student that passes standardized tests.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Teacher pay should be determined by how well their students are doing,” Christie said. “They need to be held accountable. If students are failing, teachers are nothing more than glorified baby sitters.”

  The above-quoted story is a work of fiction from a satirical (i.e., fake news) site. A
