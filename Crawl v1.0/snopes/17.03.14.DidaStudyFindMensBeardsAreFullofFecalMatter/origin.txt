  However, a
  <strong>
   new study
  </strong>
  has shown that
  <strong>
   beards are basically filled
  </strong>
  with
  <strong>
   more bacteria than the inside of a toilet
  </strong>
  . According to KOAT Albuquerque, several anonymous men allowed a microbiologist to swab their beards for bacterial testing.
  <strong>
   A few of the beards contained standard stuff while others revealed fecal matter.
  </strong>
  While the microbiologist recommended a good beard scrubbing and regular hand-washing to diminish the amount of germs, he didn’t explain how a man’s beard could end up with poop in the first place.
