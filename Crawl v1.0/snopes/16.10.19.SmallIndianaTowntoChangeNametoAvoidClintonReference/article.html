  The small town of Clinton, Indiana is the subject of a particularly flimsy fake news story circulating online.
 </p>
 <p>
  On 18 October 2016, America News Product published an
  <a href="http://archive.is/fHwC2" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  headlined “Small Indiana Town to Change Name to Avoid Clinton Reference,” a three-paragraph story stating that:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The mayor, who himself is a Democrat, announced the change on Monday. He says that the name of the city will be changed to DeWitt, to honor what the town was really named for (DeWitt Clinton), and at the same time making a political jab at the Clintons.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I cannot stand to see Hillary Clinton win the presidency. That name has been haunting me ever since her husband had the affair. I do not want our city to be associated with the Clintons, who are very crooked politicians. That is why I plan to change the name of our city.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Clinton’s actual mayor,

   Jack Gilfoy,
  </a>
  is in fact a Democrat. And there is no record of his repudiating the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband or ordering a name change for the town, which was indeed named for former New York Gov. DeWitt Clinton.
