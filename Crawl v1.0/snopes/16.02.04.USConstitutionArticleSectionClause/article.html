  On 2 January 2016, an event known as the “Malheur Occupation” or “Oregon Standoff”
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2016/01/06/oregon-armed-takeover/" target="_blank">
   began

  at the headquarters of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Harney County, Oregon. The armed militia that occupied the building on the reserve said they were doing so in order to protest overreach by the federal government after two

  were sentenced to prison for arson on public lands. The standoff mostly ended on 26 January 2016, when one

  One of the discussions that ensued as a result of this was government ownership of land. Social media users focused a number of posts and tweets at policies and practices relating to the Bureau of Land Management, particularly a common assertion about the legality of federally-managed lands when considered in light of a portion of the U.S. Constitution that supposedly states:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Federal Government shall never own title to any real property which is not specifically authorized by this Constitution such as parks, forests, dams, waterways, and grazing areas without the consent of the State where same is located.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  However, these words do not appear anywhere in the U.S. Constitution, so an argument that the Constitution specifically prohibits the federal government from “owning title” to “grazing areas” (without the permission of the states in which those areas are located) fails on that basis.

 <p>
  Some online pundits have asserted that the specific wording at issue here is found in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution (at “Clause 17,” although it is not numbered as such), which reads:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Congress shall have Power:
  </p>
  <p>
   To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States, and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings.
