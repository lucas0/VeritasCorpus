  In March 2017, an advertisement disguised as a news
  <a href="https://archive.is/LSajx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   story
  </a>
  appeared to report that Facebook CEO’s Mark Zuckerberg was leaving the company in order to sell skin care products. The hoax report was published on the web site GetInkNews.co:

   This fake news article is full of deceptive information, including digitally manipulated images that appear to show Zuckerberg with celebrities such as Katy Perry, Selena Gomez, Oprah Winfrey, Savannah Guthrie, and President Barack Obama, along with fake quotes from them endorsing “EcoMaxx” skin care products:

  Neither Katy Perry nor any of the other aforementioned celebrities have endorsed this product, and the web site took unrelated images of Zuckerberg and various celebrities (the image of Katy Perry was taken in

  </a>
  ) to make it seem as if they had endorsed Zuckerberg’s skin care line together.
 </p>
 <p>
  The advertisement
  <em>
  </em>
  also claimed that Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan were giving away free samples of the product (as long as customers paid for shipping and handling):
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   ZUCKERBERG GIVES PRODUCTS AWAY FOR FREE!
  </p>
  <p>
   So, what if you aren’t rich or famous? Chan and Zuckerberg don’t care. After all, they are already worth more than $556 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   “We aren’t in this to make a fortune,” Chan told a friend recently. “We already have amassed a fortune. I just want to help people.”
  </p>
  <p>
   That is why she is now offering readers the opportunity to experience the joys of younger looking skin for FREE!
  </p>
  <p>
   The only cost to you is a $4.95 shipping and handling fee, so you can try the EcoMaxx Ageless Moisturizer and EcoMaxx Ageless Eye Revitalizer have it delivered right to your front door. Simply click on the link here for ordering details.

  This a relatively new form of the ubiquitous fake news: an advertisement designed to mimic a genuine news item in order to convince people to buy a skin care product. At the very bottom of this web page, below the comments section, below several links to purchase this product, and below several fake celebrity endorsements, appears a disclaimer:
