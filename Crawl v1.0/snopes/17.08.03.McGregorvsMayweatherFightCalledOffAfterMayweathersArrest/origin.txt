 <p>
  Free time is about to run out for Floyd Mayweather Jr., who is due to begin a three-month jail sentence in Las Vegas stemming from a hair-pulling, arm-twisting attack in September 2010 on the mother of three of his children.
 </p>
 <p>
  The unbeaten five-division champion’s legal and ring advisers weren’t immediately commenting Thursday about Mayweather’s scheduled Friday morning surrender before Las Vegas Justice of the Peace Melissa Saragosa.
 </p>
 <p>
  The judge sentenced him Dec. 22 for his guilty plea to reduced charges in the domestic battery case.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mayweather’s lawyers, Karen Winckler and Richard Wright, said previously they didn’t plan to seek another postponement or delay.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mayweather, now 35, was initially due to begin his sentence Jan. 6. But Saragosa agreed at the last minute to let him remain free long enough to fight Miguel Cotto on May 5 in Las Vegas. The fighter who goes by the nickname “Money” won the bout and a guaranteed $32 million. Cotto was paid $8 million.
