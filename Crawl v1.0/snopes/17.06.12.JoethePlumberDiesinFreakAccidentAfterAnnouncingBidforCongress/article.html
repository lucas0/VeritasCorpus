  On 12 June 2017, the America’s Last Line of Defense web site published an article positing that Joe the Plumber, a minor celebrity from the 2008 president election, had died in an accident after announcing he was seeking a seat in the U.S. Senate:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “Joe the Plumber” Wurzelbacher, the tradesman who made a name for himself by making Obama look foolish on the campaign trail in 2008, died this morning unexpectedly when a piece of heavy equipment fell over and crushed him at a ribbon-cutting ceremony in his hometown of Camden, New Jersey.
  </p>
  <p>
   Joe, who wasn’t really a licensed plumber and has since held onto his 14 1/2 minutes of fame somehow, had just announced that he was running for Senate to replace Senator Hal Lindsay, who was found dead of a heart attack yesterday after his ranch in Minnesota was raided for drugs and tied to the Clinton Foundation.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  There was no truth to this story, which originated solely with America’s Last Line of Defense, a fake news site whose disclaimer notes that it “is a satirical publication” which presents “fiction as fact” and uses “sources [that] don’t actually exist.”
