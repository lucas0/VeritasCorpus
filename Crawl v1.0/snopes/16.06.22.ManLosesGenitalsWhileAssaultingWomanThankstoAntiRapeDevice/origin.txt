  A New York woman is thanking the makers of an anti-rape device saying that it
  <em>
   “saved her from being raped and brutally assaulted.”
  </em>
  Michelle Kingston says she was walking home from work in the afternoon on Sunday when a man jumped out of a side alley and grabbed her.
  <em>
   “I couldn’t scream, it happened so quick. He put his hand over my mouth and threatened me with a knife. I stayed calm and complied knowing he was about to get the karma he deserved.”
  </em>

  The ‘Karma’ that Kingston describes is a device that was purchased for her by her grandfather.
  <em>
   “I wanted my granddaughter to be safe, so I purchased this anti-rape device for her,”
  </em>
  said Mitchell Kingston, the grandfather.
  <em>
   “She fussed about it, but finally gave in. She’s gorgeous and only 18 and I don’t want her to be taken advantage of or assaulted. She walks to and from work every day in the city, and rapes happen multiple times per day. That punk got would he deserved.”

  According to Kingston, the minute he penetrated his victim, the device sliced his genitals with 6 razors in one clean sweep. Then, the device slices down one more time on its way out. The perpetrator fell to the ground screaming in agony, which gave Kingston the time to run and call police on her cell phone. The man, 38-year-old Ronald Steadway, was transported to a nearby hospital where his penis had to be surgically removed.
