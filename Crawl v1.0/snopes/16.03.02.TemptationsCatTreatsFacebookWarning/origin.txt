  Mama Jo here,
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ve got a serious issue going on here and we want to get the word out. 12 of our babies have been basically poisoned by Temptations cat treats. They are vomiting, and 2 of them have bloody stools. They vet said they are all in various stages of renal failure, but said thankfully because we’re so diligent in watching them, that we caught it early and they should recover, although 2 of them may develop chronic renal failure as a result. We arent out of the woods yet, but things seems to be looking up for all of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m going to post a picture of the package these treats were in.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our vet said we arent the first to have issues with this treats, and because the FDA refuses to do anything, we wont be the last. We consider ourselves very lucky. Several cats have died as a result of the renal failure caused by these treats.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please keep a very close eye on your furbabies if you feed them Temptations cat treats.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please keep our babies in your thoughts and prayers. We still have a hard road a head of us in their recovery.
 </p>
