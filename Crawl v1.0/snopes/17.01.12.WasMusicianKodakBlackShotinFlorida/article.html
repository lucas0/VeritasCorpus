  On 26 December 2016, the web site
  <em>
   Gummy Post
  </em>
  <a href="http://archive.is/pPHvw" target="_blank">
   published
  </a>
  an article which reported that the musician
  <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/kodakblack/profile/" target="_blank">
   Kodak Black
  </a>
  was shot outside a nightclub in Florida:
 </p>
 <blockquote>

  </p>
  <p>

  This article is a hoax.
  <em>

  claimed that the information was gathered from a “police report,” but we have found no record of a shooting involving Kodak Black (real name Dieuson Octave) in Florida in December 2016.

  also published a video purportedly showing the crime scene from Kodak Black’s shooting, but it actually showed an unrelated crime scene:

   The day after the purported shooting, Kodak Black posted a video (which has since been

  The musician also showed no signs of having been injured by a shooting  in the days after the alleged incident. For instance, on 29 December 2016 he posted a picture of himself at the dentist:
