  An English-language Turkish newspaper published — then quickly scrubbed — a 18 January 2018 story reporting that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had made an extravagant purchase in Monaco.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to the report, which ran in the
  <em>
   Hurriyet Daily News,
  </em>
  Zuckerberg secretly bought the “super yacht,”
  <em>
   Ulysses
  </em>
  , from a reclusive New Zealand businessman, Graeme Hart, for $150 million in October 2017.

 <p>
  Though the sale itself was first

   reported
  </a>
  by news outlets, the buyer was not announced. However, shortly after the story was published it was quickly
  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/18/mark-zuckerberg-bought-a-150-million-expedition-yacht/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   debunked
  </a>
  by a spokesperson for Zuckerberg:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The reports related to Mark purchasing a yacht are completely inaccurate as he did not purchase a yacht.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The spokesperson later
  <a href="https://gizmodo.com/mark-zuckerberg-quietly-bought-a-giant-escape-yacht-wh-1822208202" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   added:
  </a>
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Mark did not buy it, does not own a yacht and was not involved in the sale.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  But instead of updating or correcting its original reporting, the
  <em>
   Hurriyet Daily News
  </em>
  instead deleted it. However,

   some
  </a>
  web sites continue to feature posts stating that the sale went through.
