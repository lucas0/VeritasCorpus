  On 2 January 2015, the entertainment web site
  <em>
   Viral Time Lapse
  </em>
  posted an item reporting that comedian Bill Cosby had killed himself in reaction to the news that criminal sexual assault charges had been brought against him:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Actor and comedian Bill Cosby, who has recently been charged with sexual assault, was found dead this morning of an apparent suicide in his Philadelphia, Pennsylvania home. He was 78.
  </p>
  <p>
   His death has been reported as “a suicide due to asphyxia.” Philadelphia police confirmed that Cosby committed suicide by hanging himself with a rope. Cosby was discovered by his wife and left no suicide note.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Bill Cosby passed away this morning,” his reps said in a statement. “He has been battling sexual assault accusations of late. This is a tragic and sudden loss. The family respectfully asks for their privacy as they grieve during this very difficult time.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  Bill Cosby was indeed

   charged

  with sexual assault (although as of 4 January 2016 the comedian was still among the living). According to a CNN

  , Cosby posted $1 million bail, and Cosby’s attorney asserted that his client

   would fight the charges:
  </br>
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Hours after Bill Cosby set foot in a Pennsylvania courtroom to face sexual assault charges, the comedian’s attorneys called the criminal case against him “unjustified” and vowed to fight it.
  </p>
  <p>
   “The charge by the Montgomery County District Attorney’s Office came as no surprise, filed 12 years after the alleged incident and coming on the heels of a hotly contested election for this county’s DA during which this case was made the focal point,” Cosby’s attorneys said in a statement released after his arraignment Wednesday. “Make no mistake, we intend to mount a vigorous defense against this unjustified charge and we expect that Mr. Cosby will be exonerated by a court of law.”

  Several rumors have circulated in the wake of Cosby’s indictment, including the false claim that the comedian’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame had been
