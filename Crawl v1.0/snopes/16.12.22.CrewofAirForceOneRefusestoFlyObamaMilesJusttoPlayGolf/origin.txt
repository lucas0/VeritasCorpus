  BREAKING: Crew Of Air Force One Refuses To Fly Obama 6000 Miles ‘Just To Play Golf’
 </p>
 <p>
  After eight years of flying to Chicago for White Castle burgers, bringing Michelle Obama to LA for the afternoon for a hair appointment and taking the Obama girls to a park they like in San Fransisco [sic] to walk the dog on the government dime, the crew of the famed Air Force One has said enough is enough.

 <p>
  Obama was set to leave Hawaii tomorrow, just for the day, to meet with a pal 6000 miles away for a round of golf. The Captain of the President’s plane told him that unless it was official business from the office of the President, he wasn’t obligated to fly him anywhere.
