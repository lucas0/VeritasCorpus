  The caption for the image read:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   We must move as quickly as possible to a one-world government; a one-world religion; under a one-world leader.

  However, Mueller — who is currently investigating President Donald Trump for possible obstruction of justice — never made such a statement. It has been attributed to Robert
  <em>
   Muller,
  </em>
  former Assistant Secretary General to the United Nations and the 1989 winner of the UNESCO Prize for Peace Education. Conspiracy theorist Dwight Kinman used the quote as an epigraph for a chapter in his 1993 book “The World’s Last Dictator”:

  Kinman does not provide a citation for that particular Muller quote, though much of his discussion of Muller centers around his novel “First Lady of the World.”  We were unable to obtain a copy of the book by press time to confirm whether the quote is accurate.

  that the quote was misattributed while throwing in an insult against Mueller, saying:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Thank you MemeRight page fans for pointing out the error in our Mueller NWO page. We don’t creat [sic] them all and strive for accuracy. While we’re no fans of the Robert Mueller who’s close buddies and in collusion with Clinton bag man James Comey, we do want to maintain our fan base with trust.
