  The images — which show neither a Goliath skeleton nor a recent archaeological discovery — have been online in various forms for more than a decade. Each image used in the graphic above has a different origin.

 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Archaeologist Dr. Richard Martin says: “We found the skull in the Valley of Elah, in the foothills of the Judean Mountains, where David’s battle with Goliath took place. The skull is huge and clearly belongs to a man of enormous stature.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Tests show that the skull is between 2 900 and 3 000 years old – about the right time for the biblical battle.

 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In this contest you will create a hoax archaeological discovery, maybe Atlantis, a 2,000 year-old Coca-Cola can or a giant’s skull. Be open minded, there are many mysteries buried beneath the earth.
  </p>
  <p>
   The rules of this game are thus:
  </p>
  <p>
   You are to create an archaeological hoax. Your job is to show a picture of an archaeological discovery that looks so real, had it not appeared at Worth1000, people might have done a double take.

  Several people submitted manipulated images appearing to show giant skeletons. A user calling themselves “

  The final image shows a sculpture by the Italian artist Gino De Domonicis. The work, titled “Calamita Cosmica” (in English “Cosmic Magnet”) toured Europe before finding a home at the Museo Nazionale delle Arti del XXI Secolo in Rome, Italy. Flickr user Mauro took this particular
