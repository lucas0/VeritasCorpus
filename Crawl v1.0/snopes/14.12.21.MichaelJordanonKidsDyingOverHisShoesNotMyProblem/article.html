  In December 2014, several deceitful websites published articles which claimed that Michael Jordan cared more about profits than the people who buy his shoes. The first
  <a href="http://nahadaily.com/gossip/michael-jordan-kids-dying-shoes-not-problem/" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  was published by the
  <i>
   Naha Daily
  </i>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “I signed up for a check. Not to save lives” Said the now fourth most scoring Nba player ever Michael Jordan.
  </p>
  <p>
   Legendary basketball player Michael Jordan told a Footaction employee during an in store sneaker signing that kids dying over his sneakers is not his problem. He’s here to sell shoes and receive a check, because that’s all he signed up for.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I mean I’m sad, but it’s just not a problem that I could fix” Said Jordan explaining that him speaking up on kids dying over his $200 dollar sneaker is just not going to solve any problems. “They want to buy my shoes. Not hear me talk.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The article was shared more than 50,000 times on Facebook within a day of its publication, and many readers seemed to believe Jordan had been quoted accurately by the
  <i>
   Naha Daily
  </i>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the web site’s insistence that Michael Jordan really did say these things to a Footaction employee, the article is completely false. A statement at the bottom of the web site states the “
  <i>
   Naha Daily
  </i>
  is a daily satirical news source. Meaning complete fiction.”

 <p>
  On 18 December 2014,
  <i>

  published a similar
  <a href="http://www.celebtricity.com/michael-jordan-i-make-shoes-for-suburban-whites-not-poor-black-kids/" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  about his Airness:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Several black activists have accused Michael Jordan of not doing enough for the black community complaining that even his shoes are too expensive for most black youths, a charge Jordan has answered himself by saying, “I make shoes for white suburban kids, not the poor black kids. That would be like opening a restaurant for people without stomachs.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  While the
  <i>
   Celebtricity
  </i>
  article, much like the
  <i>
   Naha Daily
  </i>
  story, is a work of
  <a href="http://www.celebtricity.com/contact-us/" target="_blank">
   fiction
  </a>
  , it does touch on a genuine issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Michael Jordan’s business practices have been criticized in the past. On 28 December 2011, shortly after the release of Air Jordan XI Concords caused a rash of violence around the United States,
  <i>
   ESPN
  </i>
  penned an
  <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/commentary/story/_/id/7393317/michael-jordan-nike-do-more-stem-violence" target="_blank">
   editorial
  </a>
  condemning Jordan and Nike for hyping their shoes and then releasing them in limited quantities:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Jordan and Nike didn’t directly encourage this recklessness. They didn’t tell people to trample others who waited in line, and it’s not their fault that a segment of people have such skewed priorities. But that doesn’t absolve Jordan or Nike for willingly feeding an out-of-control monster.
  </p>
  <p>
   Let’s put aside the fact that these Air Jordans cost an absurd $180. The marketing campaign for these shoes is essentially akin to yelling “fire” in a crowded movie theater.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nike, which created the Air Jordan brand in 1984, makes a big deal out of the fact that it only releases the Jordan XIs — arguably Jordan’s most sought-after shoe — once a year and they will be in available only in extremely limited supply.
  </p>
  <p>
   Translation: Do whatever you have to do to get these shoes. And if people get hurt in the process, so be it.
