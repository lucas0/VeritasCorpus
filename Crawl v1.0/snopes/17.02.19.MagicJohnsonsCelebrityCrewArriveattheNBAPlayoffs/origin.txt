  at Caesars Palace could have been empty except for one basketball and two of the game’s most illustrious players ever. They would’ve been free of teammates, facing each other head-on in
  <em>
   The King of the Court,
  </em>
  to finally answer a question that remained unanswered for so long: Who’s better—Michael Jordan or Magic Johnson?

  The game was to consist of two halves—one-on-one, 15 minutes each—in a heavyweight matchup: a pay-per-view special, maybe on HBO, but certainly not NBC, because this wasn’t going to be some regular Sunday afternoon NBA game. This was meant to be a stunt of the highest order, under the bright lights of Las Vegas, the winner set to take home $1 million, with many,
  <em>
   many
  </em>
  more millions at stake.

  You’d still be talking about the original
  <em>
   King of the Court
  </em>
  right now if the TV executives had their way, because it could have been the pilot of an annual series: Duncan vs. Garnett, Kobe vs. LeBron, Westbrook vs. Curry, you name it. Instead, Jordan vs. Magic remains lost to memory of what may be the greatest basketball game never played.
