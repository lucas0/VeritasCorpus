  We were outside one day at youth group and he was just trying to push my buttons. He was just kind of not taking the Lord serious. So I walked over to him and went BAM! Punched him in the chest as hard as I could. I crumpled the kid. I just crumpled him.

  Then I leaned over and said, ‘Ben, when are you going to stop playing games with God?’ I led that man to the Lord right there.
