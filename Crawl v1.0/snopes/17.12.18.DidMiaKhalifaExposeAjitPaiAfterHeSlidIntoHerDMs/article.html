  article is not a genuine news story, but it did come close enough to the truth that many people believed (or wanted to believe) it was real, as not only has Khalifa publicly shamed unwanted suitors on social media before, she is also clearly not a fan of Ajit Pai’s or the decision to repeal net neutrality.

  For example, Khalifa

   tweeted
