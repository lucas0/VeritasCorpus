  One of the most persistent myths about crime in Sweden is that some areas are so dangerous due to outlaw asylum seekers that police can’t enter them. For example, U.K.-based tabloid

  <p>
   The shocking attack [of bottles being thrown at police] on the on-duty officers is just one of many incidents, as officials have placed more than 50 areas on a ‘no-go zone’ list where they admit they do not have control.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lawless thugs are wreaking havoc unchecked, and officers are often at personal risk when entering the crisis-hit areas.

  But Swedish police were quick to tell us that these so-called no-go zones do not exist. The term originated with newspaper

   columnist

  Per Gudmundson

  who used it to refer to a police report identifying “problem areas” in the country, where there is a criminal milieu. In these areas, there is high crime, low socioeconomic status, and lack of social integration and cooperation which presents a special challenge to police. But Erik Jansåker, a police chief in Malmö’s southern areas (the city is often singled out as a high-crime area), told us that the term “no-go zone” never appeared in the report itself – and Gudmundson admits as much in his column. However, since he used it, the term has taken hold in the popular imagination.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jansåker’s jurisdiction includes two “problem areas,” Malmö neighborhoods Rosengård and Seved. He told us that local investigators have been overwhelmed with the caseload from 14 recent murders — 8 to 10 in the same time span would be normal for the area – but that there aren’t areas where police can’t go.

   Officer Johannes Schultz, took us along on his regular foot patrol of Rosengård. He walked briskly and frequently stopped to greet or chat briefly with citizens. One little boy stepped in his path to ask for a high-five, and Schultz happily obliged. Another child on a scooter smiled at him and sought his attention by calling shyly, “Johannes!” Schultz said hello. People were out walking and children crowded playgrounds.

 </p>
 <p>
  “You’re in the ‘no-go zone,'” Schultz said jokingly. “Are you scared? Me neither.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It is clear that Schultz and other officers in his cohort spend a lot of time in the neighborhood. He described going out and talking to schoolchildren in an effort to build rapport, and every other person he passed seemed to not only know him, but to like him. Despite the negative attention, Schultz said that Rosengård is a tight-knit community where people look out for each other:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I actually really, really love working here. We’ve been working hard, working the way I do now. I’ve been doing this for two years. It takes a very long time, just talking to them. Slowly people are beginning to turn. Nowadays we get a lot of, ‘We hate the police. Well not you, you’re okay.’ That’s a step forward from before when it was ‘We hate all police officers.”
  </p>
