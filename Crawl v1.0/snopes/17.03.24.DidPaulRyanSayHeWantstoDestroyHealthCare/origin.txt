  Paul Ryan (R-WI) said that Republicans would continue to push to repeal health care reform.

  “We believe that this law is going to collapse under its own weight… This to us is something that we’re not going to give up on, because we’re not going to give up on destroying the health care system for the American people,” he said during a news conference to unveil his latest budget plan. “We want to prevent this law, which we really do believe will do great damage to families and the health care system in America.”

  Ryan was referring to President Barack Obama’s signature health care reform law, the Affordable Care Act. His budget plan would repeal most of the law, with a few exceptions.
