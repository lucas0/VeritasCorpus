  reporting that 23 U.S. states had agreed to ban the sale and use of hollow point ammunition effective on 5 January 2017:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   23-states have agreed to pass a controversial bill that will create a ban on the future sale and possession of hollow-point ammunition. The ban on the popular ammunition is in effect immediately, however does include a 90-day grace period prior to state law enforcement enforcing the ban. The official compliance date for the hollow-point ammunition ban is January 5th, 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though the ammo ban has created a strong divide among the citizens of the 23 participating states (California, Washington, Oregon, Utah, Arizona, Kansas, North Dakota, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin, New York, Alabama, Maine, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Iowa, Nebraska, West Virginia, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Rhode Island, South Carolina), it’s said to be widely supported by state representatives. Many politicians and citizens alike have vocalized their disagreement with the ban and feel that denying the public access to hollow-point ammunition is a clear infringement of their second amendment rights, however many feel that the ban is a positive step towards much needed gun control measures … According to the bill, the ban will extend to hollow-point ammunition of all caliber including the most popular ammunition calibers, 9mm Luger, .223 Remington, and .45 ACP. Additionally- law enforcement agencies within the relevant states will also be prohibited from using hollow-point ammunition in their police issued side-arm’s, however will be provided with an extended compliance date of July 2nd, 2017.

  . Neither does a  real newspaper called the Boston Tribune either — that name has been appropriated by a fake news site which (by design) many online readers now confuse as a legitimate news outlet on par with the real
