  This legend is a tricky subject to tackle, because it’s based upon the fine (and often confusing) distinction between actual death and declared death.  For example, if a seriously-injured victim of an automobile accident were loaded into a ambulance and died en route to the hospital, he generally would not be officially
  <u>
   declared
  </u>
  dead until he arrived at the hospital and was examined by a doctor.  The difference in time between the actual physical death of the patient and the declaration of death by the doctor is the discrepancy on which this legend turns.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, the claim here is not that no one has ever actually died on Disney theme park property, but whether Disney can legitimately make the claim that “no one has ever died at a Disney park” because they ensure that any
  <u>
   declaration
  </u>
  of death takes place outside of park property.

 <p>
  As such, there are really two questions which must be answered:
 </p>
 <p>
  <ul>
   <br>
    <li>
     Does Disney really attempt to get injured (or already-dead) persons off their property before any declaration of death occurs?
    </li>
   </br>
  </ul>
 </p>
 <p>
  <li>
   Has Disney always been successful in this effort?
  </li>
