  I thought this was interesting. I looked in the grocery store and the bread wrappers do have different colored twist ties, and even the ones with the plastic clips have different colors. You learn something new
  <br>
   everyday!!When you go to buy bread in the grocery store, have you ever wondered which is the freshest, so you “squeeze” for freshness or softness.
  </br>
 </p>
 <p>
  Did you know that bread is delivered fresh to the stores five days a week? Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. And each day has a different color twist tie. They are:
 </p>
 <p>
  Monday – Blue
  <br/>
  Tuesday – Green
  <br/>
  Thursday – Red
  <br/>
  Friday – White
  <br/>
  Saturday – Yellow
 </p>
 <p>
  So today being Thursday, I wanted a red twist tie – not white which is Friday (almost a week old?)
 </p>
 <p>
  The colors go alphabetically by color Blue – Green – Red – White – Yellow, Monday thru Saturday. Very easy to remember. But I put a post-it note in my wallet when I first found out about this so I would not forget.
 </p>
 <p>
  Enjoy fresh bread when you buy bread with the right color on the day you are shopping.
