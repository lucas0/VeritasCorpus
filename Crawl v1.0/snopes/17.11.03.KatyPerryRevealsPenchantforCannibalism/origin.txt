  Human flesh is the finest meat in the world, according to Katy Perry, who puts the “
  <em>
   exquisite flavor
  </em>
  ” of the meat down to “
  <em>
   the taboo nature of the product
  </em>
  ” and the fact that “
  <em>
   forbidden pleasures are always the most delicious
  </em>
  .”
 </p>
 <p>
  Going as far as to claim that cannibalism is “
  <em>
   way more popular than you might think
  </em>
  ”, Katy Perry also claimed that “
  <em>
   so many people in Hollywood tell you that human meat is the best, the absolute best, meat in the world
  </em>
  .”
