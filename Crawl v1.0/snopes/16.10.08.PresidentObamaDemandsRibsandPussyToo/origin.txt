  One of the guys sitting nearby must have overheard us because he leaned over with a sagacious expression on his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You guys talking about Malcolm? Malcolm tells it like it is. No doubt about it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yeah,” another guy said. “But I’ll tell you what. You won’t moving to no African jungle anytime soon. Or some goddamn desert somewhere sitting on a carpet. With a bunch of Arabs. No sir. You won’t stop me eating no ribs, either. Gotta have them ribs. And pussy too. Don’t Malcolm talk about no pussy. Now you know that ain’t gonna work.”

  I noticed Ray laughing and looked at him sternly.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What are you laughing at?” I said to him. “You never even read Malcolm. You don’t even know what he says.”
