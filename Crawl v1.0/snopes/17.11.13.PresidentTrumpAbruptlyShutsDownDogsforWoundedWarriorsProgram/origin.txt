  <strong>
   Trump Abruptly Shuts Down Dogs for Wounded Warriors Program, Leaving Vets High and Dry on Veteran’s Day!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  This week, the useful Warrior Canine Connection program received a shocking letter at the program’s office in the Washington D.C. area. The letter instructed personnel to leave their posts immediately and shut down the program for vets.
 </p>
 <p>
  They have since closed their offices at Fort Belvoir in Northern Virginia and on the campus of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Washington.
 </p>
 <p>
  Warrior Canine Connection Executive Director Rick Yount stated:
 </p>
 <p>
  “At two o’clock in the afternoon, I received a phone call saying there was a stop work order. There was no explanation whatsoever as to why that was the decision.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He asked, “Why would — all of the sudden — a program be halted that was serving patients?”
