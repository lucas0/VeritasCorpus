<blockquote>
 <p>
  There was no halftime show under the Friday night lights at Mississippi’s Brandon High School — the marching band had been benched.
 </p>
 <p>
  The band was ordered off the field because the Christian hymn “How Great Thou Art” was a part of their halftime show — in violation of a federal court order.
 </p>
 <p>
  Word about the band getting benched spread across the town quicker than kudzu. I must have received emails and Facebook messages from nearly the entire state — from Desoto County to Yazoo City.
 </p>
 <p>
  Something must be done to right this wrong, people said. A message had to be sent to the likes of Judge Reeves. Locals gathered in coffee shops and garages to devise their plan.
 </p>
 <p>
  And what they did — would become known as the musical shot heard around the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  During halftime of Friday night’s game — a lone voice began to sing the forbidden song.
