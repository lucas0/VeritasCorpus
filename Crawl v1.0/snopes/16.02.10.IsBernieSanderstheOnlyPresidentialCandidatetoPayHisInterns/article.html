  In response to a political image
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/sanders-interns-minimum-wage/" target="_blank">
   criticizing
  </a>
  Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders for only paying his interns $12 an hour while advocating for an increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour (an issue that referenced his U.S. Senate staff rather than his presidential campaign staff), another political image circulated in February 2016 claimed that the “socialist” presidential candidate was the only one to pay his campaign interns anything at all.

  This image was likely inspired by a December 2015

  article which

   reported
  </a>
  that Sanders was the only one of 16 presidential candidates (in any party) currently paying his campaign interns:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In August, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton tweeted an application for unpaid interns, requiring a résumé and two letters of reference. Just a few days later, she was posting about the student debt crisis.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the Republican side, former Florida governor Jeb Bush has called the opportunity gap “the defining issue of our time,” and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has railed against “upward-mobility stagnation.” Like Clinton, both of them have proposals to reduce student debt. Even retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson wants public universities to pay the interest on student loans, while business mogul Donald Trump has accused the federal government of profiting off students.
  </p>
  <p>
   But of the 16 candidates running for president, only one pays his interns: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), at $10.10 an hour.

 </blockquote>
 <p>
  While it may be generally accurate to say that Bernie Sanders is one of the few (if not the only) 2016 presidential candidate paying his interns, a few exceptions and clarifications that should be noted.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, the candidates offering unpaid internships are not breaking any laws. In most cases, it is perfectly legal to hire interns for non-paying positions as long as those interns receive some tangible benefit (such as school credit or valuable work experience) in return. Second, some candidates, such as Republican Ben Carson, do offer their interns others forms of compensation, such as stipends for food or travel. And neither we nor the
  <em>
   Washington Post
  </em>
  have been able to determine if GOP candidate Donald Trump’s campaigns offers internships (or, if so, whether those internships are paid positions), although we note that interns at Trump Entertainment Resorts are reportedly paid $10 an hour.

  a paid internship position (although such ads do not necessarily indicate that

  Unpaid internships are quite common in politics. A 2013 study by the
  <em>
   Atlantic
  </em>
  found that only one-third of U.S. senators paid their interns. That article also criticized Democratic senators for being more stingy in their use of unpaid interns while singling out Bernie Sanders (technically an independent) as an
