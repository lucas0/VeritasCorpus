  On 15 August 2017, President Trump retweeted a cartoon depiction of a train running over a CNN reporter. He then quickly deleted the post, leaving some people skeptical that it had really happened.

  Trump’s retweet came just three days after Heather Heyer was killed when a white supremacist plowed a car into a group of protesters at a
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/antifa-member-photographed-beating-police-officer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   rally

  in Charlottesville, Virginia. A day before the retweet, Trump had once again accused

   CNN
  </a>
  of being “fake news” (which it is not).
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Trump certainly retweeted this image, the original poster, Twitter user @SLandinSoCal, quibbled with the media’s reporting, arguing that the train wasn’t actually “running over” the reporter:
 </p>
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
  <p dir="ltr" lang="en">
   MSM depicted my meme as showing the TrumpTrain “running over” a reporter.
   <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FakeNews?src=hash" target="_blank">
    #FakeNews
   </a>
   ‼️ The reporter is trying to stop it- feet popping ties.

   Democrats are having a hard time stopping the momentum of the incoming Donald J. Trump’s administration.

  Trump did not explain why he posted or subsequently deleted this image, but

   reported
  </a>
  that it wasn’t the only social media gaffe Trump made on the morning of 15 August 2017. The President also retweeted (and quickly deleted) a message calling him a fascist:
 </p>
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

   I’m announcing my retirement from Twitter. I’ll never top this RT.
