   ’s background &amp; you will find he is not a smart guy—he just wants people to think he is–just call him dummy.

  Many people weren’t surprised, then, when a series of tweets surfaced appearing to show Trump going after God Himself, dismissing the creator of the universe as a “one of the dumbest and worst jerks of all time,” a “dope” and a “clown”:

  Except that, unlike the previous examples, these tweets weren’t real. They were the centerpiece of a
  <a href="http://thegoodlordabove.com/trump-attacks-god-in-tweetstorm/" target="_blank">
   spoof
  </a>
  dreamed up by the folks who run a satirical web site called
  <a href="http://thegoodlordabove.com/" target="_blank">
   TheGoodLordAbove
  </a>
  , which purports to be God’s own web presence. The site’s
  <a href="http://thegoodlordabove.com/about-god/" target="_blank">
   disclaimer

  reads as follows:

 <blockquote>

  Donald Trump has never, to our knowledge, actually tweeted smack about God. But stay tuned.
