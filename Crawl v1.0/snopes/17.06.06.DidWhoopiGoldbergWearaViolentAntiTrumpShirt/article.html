  The image appeared on a meme alongside a demand Goldberg be “fired from ‘The View’ and boycotted.” In late May and early June 2017 social media users shared the image and referenced Griffin’s controversy. (Griffin

  that her career was “over” after the incident, and she was fired from her intermittent position at CNN.)

  However, the photograph antedated the Griffen controversy. In an 18 April 2017 video published to the official YouTube channel for “The View,” Goldberg explained that someone had doctored an image of her at the 2017 Women’s March that followed Trump’s inauguration:

  In the April 2017 segment, Goldberg said that despite her opposition to President Trump, she would never wear a shirt like the one in the altered image.
