  [I]t looks like the Friends reunion is definitely NOT happening, ever – according to Lisa Kudrow anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 53-year-old actress, who played Phoebe Buffay in the long-running comedy series, discussed the possibility of all six friends coming together again, only to reveal that it’s not going to happen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Speaking to heat magazine, she said: “I feel like I’m just constantly bursting that little bubble of hope, each and every time it’s asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s been 13 years, 13 years of the same question and right now, or in the future, it’s not going to happen. And every time I say that, I get yelled at.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Kudrow continued: “What’s it going to be about? Really, how is it going to work? This is what everybody is forgetting.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They no longer hang out at the coffee house, they have all moved away. Chandler and Monica live upstate, Phoebe and Mike, probably the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  “[W]hat reason would there be for them all to come together for a significant amount of time. The setting, and that time of life, worked brilliantly for then.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She added: “It would be great [if it happened]. It would be a lot of fun. But even just from a logistical purpose, it would never work because everyone is on a totally, ridiculous work schedule, that’s the opposite of someone else.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s even impossible for us to get together for dinner, it’s really hard. It’s six people, how easy it is for you to get six of your friends together?”
