 <p>
  He added he wasn’t elected by “Those sort of people in the first place” and credits his win to Dreamers Brave enough to register to vote for him.

 <p>
  Further he stated DACA recipients need to be treated as first Class citizens, not as undocumented aliens, while seniors and disable Veterans as well as active duty need to be removed from preferential treatment and learn to pass their privlage onto our most honored Citizens Dreamers. DACA or shut down the government till Dreamers can vote in midterm elections.
