   Although the text accompanying the image is accurate — the program
   <em>
    Star vs. The Forces of Evil
   </em>
   did feature a same-sex kiss in an
   <a href="http://nypost.com/2017/03/01/disney-has-its-first-gay-kiss/" target="_blank">
    episode
   </a>
   that aired on the Disney XD cable channel — the pictured characters were not involved in that moment of animated affection.

  This images features a rendering of two characters from older classic Disney animated feature films — Prince Eric from
  <em>
   The Little Mermaid
  </em>
  (

   1989

  ) and Prince Phillip from
  <em>
   Sleeping Beauty
  </em>
  (
  <a href="http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Prince_Phillip" target="_blank">
   1959
  </a>
  ) — that was

   created
  </a>
  by Mexican artist Rodolfo Loaiza for a series called “Disenchanted Disney.” The kiss Loaiza depicted did not actually appear in any Disney television program or film.

  The real same-sex kiss included in
  <em>
   Star vs. The Forces of Evil
  </em>
  featured two nameless background characters shown during a brief montage of kissing cartoons in the season 2 episode “Just Friends.” The moment can be glimpsed at around the 1:25 second mark of the following video:
