  On 14 August 2015, the blog
  <em>
   Healthy Food House
  </em>
  published an article titled “Johnson &amp; Johnson Admits: Our Baby Products Contain Cancer-Causing Formaldehyde,” whose text proclaimed:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Although [Johnson &amp; Johnson] claims that the amount of formaldehyde isn’t large enough to be detrimental to humans — even infant humans — the fact is that it still has allowed this chemical for as long as they have been making the No More Tears shampoo.
  </p>
  <p>
   But now, the company has announced the removal of formaldehyde from that shampoo and they are removing it from one hundred other products that they manufacture as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   It could be seen as a sign of good intentions that the company is removing it from their products.
   <strong>
    But the real question is: why hasn’t it been removed before now?
   </strong>
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Actually, the “real question” about removing formaldehyde from their shampoo products had been addressed by Johnson &amp; Johnson nearly two years earlier, as noted in a 17 January 2014
  <em>
   New York Times
  </em>
  article titled “The ‘No More Tears’ Shampoo, Now with No Formaldehyde”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   What’s different about the shampoo, and 100 other baby products sold by Johnson &amp; Johnson, isn’t so much about what’s been added; it’s what’s missing.
   <strong>
    The products no longer contain two potentially harmful chemicals, formaldehyde and 1,4-dioxane
   </strong>
   , that have come under increasing scrutiny by consumers and environmental groups.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    In response to consumer pressure two years ago, the company pledged to remove both chemicals from its baby products by the end of 2013, and this month, it said that it had met that goal.
   </strong>
   The reformulated products are making their way to store shelves around the world and will replace existing products over the next several months.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The push for removing formaldehyde to which the
  <i>
   Times
  </i>
  referred was not a recent occurrence: it had occurred as early as 2012, according to a
  <em>
   Scientific American
  </em>
  <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/johnson-and-johnson-removes-some-chemicals-from-baby-shampoo-other-products/" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  . Moreover, Johnson &amp; Johnson expressed at the time that the reason behind their reformulation was entirely rooted in implicitly baseless consumer fears:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Johnson &amp; Johnson pledged last August [2012] to eliminate formaldehyde, parabens, triclosan and phthalates from all baby products. For adult products, it has removed triclosan and phthalates, but will keep using three parabens, and use formaldehyde in exceptional cases where other preservatives wouldn’t work, according to the company’s new policy.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Driving Johnson &amp; Johnson’s initiative is the consumer.
   </strong>
   In recent years, its customers have been asking questions about chemicals in the products, said Samantha Lucas, a corporate spokeswoman, in an interview from its New Brunswick, N.J., headquarters.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    “We’ve been replying with evidence of the science that ensures safety. Now we have to go beyond science and be responsive to our consumers because it’s really about their peace of mind,” she said.
   </strong>
