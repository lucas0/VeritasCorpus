  As for today, let’s look at a video detailing their animatronic Kaiju parasites used in Guillermo del Toro’s Pacific Rim. They are also referred to as Skinmites, and I guess, Rollie Pollies? Reminder for those that forgot, these are the creatures that live on the Kaiju, much like a Remora fish does with a shark.
