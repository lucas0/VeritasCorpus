  One of the things we need to stop is the wild rumors
  <br>
   1. No the Governor can’t stop stop supplies from coming to the camp.
   <br/>
   2. No DAPL is not buying up the hotel rooms at prairie Knights.
   <br/>
   <strong>
    3. No we are not being sprayed with chemicals
   </strong>
   <br/>
   4. No little girls have died at camp.
   <br/>
   5. No we did not kill 30 cows or buffalo with arrows.
   <br/>
   6. No we did not shoot arrows at planes
   <br/>
   7. No we did not throw any propane bottles at the police.
   <br/>
   8. No there are no weapons at camp.
   <br/>
   9. No one is getting paid to protest
   <br/>
   10. This movement is not outsiders coming in. It is the people of the Native Nations who are standing with our allies.
   <br/>
   11. No Morton County can not raid the camp, this is Federal land under the Army Corp of Engineer and the county police is under the county. They only can care for things in the county which is under the states and the state control the county which the state is under the federal government who control the state government so it would have to be an order from the president and that is not going to happen.
   <br/>
   12. No CPS can not come and take the children from their families.
   <br/>
   13. No they can not close down the school.
   <br/>
   Remember we have DAPL employees in the camp to spread these rumors. If you hear anyone use the speaker saying these things run them out. Don’t allow rumors to control us we are standing our grounds. We must stand together as defenders of the water. STOP DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE #nodapl #waterislife
