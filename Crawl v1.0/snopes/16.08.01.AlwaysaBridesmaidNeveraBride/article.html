  Bridesmaids are female attendants who traditionally serve to ready the bride on her wedding day, plus in more modern times run various nuptial-related errands on her behalf in the months and weeks leading up to the big day. At one time they were chosen from among the unwed young women of marriageable age of the bride’s acquaintance, but these days neither age nor marital status bars a cherished friend or family member from serving in the bride’s retinue.

  Given that in earlier times the focus of the bridesmaid role was to supply the bride with a court of young, unwed lovelies, the saying “Always a bridesmaid but never a bride” was a sad one, in that the bride, by virtue of having snagged a husband, was viewed at having succeeded at her life’s task whereas her attendants — no matter how lovely or accomplished — as having failed. A woman who had been a bridesmaid a number of times was someone whose marriage prospects were dim indeed, in that she had clearly been passed over by the eligible men of her acquaintance in favor of others.

  for the marital prospects of that bridal helper. Superstition has it that a gal who acts in this capacity three times dooms herself to perpetual spinsterhood. However, there is an out — go on to be a bridesmaid seven times and the curse is broken.)

  Given how vital making a good match was to the future of women’s lives in the not all too distant past, one would think the aphorism “Always a bridesmaid but never a bride” has been with us forever. Surprisingly, it dates to only the

  Songwriter Fred Leigh may have been the first to use the phrase in the sphere of popular culture, penning a

  ditty titled “Why Am I Always the Bridesmaid?” that included the following chorus:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Why am I always the bridesmaid
   <br>
    Never the blushing bride
    <br/>
    Ding, Dong, wedding bells
    <br/>
    Only ring for other gals
    <br/>
    But one fine day
    <br/>
    Please let it be soon
    <br/>
    I shall wake up in the morning
    <br/>
    On my own honeymoon.
