<blockquote>
 <p>
  According to a
  <em>
   New York Times
  </em>
  article published in June 1927, a man with the name and address of Donald Trump’s father was arraigned after Klan members attacked cops in Queens, N.Y.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 1927, Donald Trump’s father would have been 21 years old, and not yet a well-known figure. Multiple sources report his residence at the time — and throughout his life — at the same address.
 </p>
 <p>
  To be clear, this is not proof that Trump senior — who would later go on to become a millionaire real estate developer — was a member of the Ku Klux Klan or even in attendance at the event. Despite sharing lawyers with the other men, it’s conceivable that he may have been an innocent bystander, falsely named, or otherwise the victim of mistaken identity during or following a chaotic event.
 </p>
 <p>
  A person answering calls at the N.Y.C. Police Department’s Records Section said that arrest reports dating that far back were not available in any form.
