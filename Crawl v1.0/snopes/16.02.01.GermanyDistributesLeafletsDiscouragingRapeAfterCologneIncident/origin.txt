 <p>
  <strong>
   In the wake of the sex assaults in Cologne on New Yearâ€™s Eve
  </strong>
  and a wave of reported cases of sexual harassment in swimming baths,
  <strong>
   officials have now created a special cartoon guide on appropriate etiquette.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The illustrations feature German captions with subtitles in English and Arabic and warn migrants not to wear underwear instead of swimming trunks, harass women, or push them in the water.
