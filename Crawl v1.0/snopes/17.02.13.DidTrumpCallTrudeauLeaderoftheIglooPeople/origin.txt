 <p>
  After blanking on the name “Canada”, U.S. President Donald Trump was overheard referring to Justin Trudeau as the “leader of the igloo people”, as the two met for crunch talks.
 </p>
 <p>
  The incident occurred during the President’s sit down meeting with the Prime Minister in the Oval Office, while Trump was commenting on how “great” the PM was as well as a “great leader of—”, he said before pausing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unaware that his microphone was on, or that everyone else in the room could easily hear him, Mr. Trump leaned over to his advisor Kellyanne Conway and whispered:
 </p>
 <p>
  “Ah, what do they call themselves again, those people,” Trump said while discreetly pointing upwards. “You know, up there where it’s cold,” he added, snapping his fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before an alarmed looking Conway could respond, Trump bluttered, “the igloo people, is that it? He’s the leader of the igloo people, right?”
