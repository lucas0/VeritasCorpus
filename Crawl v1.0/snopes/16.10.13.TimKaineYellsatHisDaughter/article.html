  back then:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The actor has been banned by a court from seeing his 11-year-old daughter, Ireland, after unleashing a string of insults at her on the telephone.
  </p>
  <p>
   Baldwin was furious when Ireland — who lives with her mother Kim Basinger in Los Angeles — did not answer the phone when she knew he was due to call from New York.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the call, recorded on the girl’s answering machine, Baldwin, 49, ranted: “You are a rude, thoughtless little pig. You don’t have the brains or the decency as a human being.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I don’t give a damn that you’re 12 years old, or 11 years old, or that you’re a child, or that your mother is a thoughtless pain in the ass who doesn’t care about what you do as far as I’m concerned.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Once again I have made an ass of myself trying to get to a phone. You have humiliated me for the last time with this phone.”
  </p>
  <p>
   He then threatened to fly to LA “for the day, just to straighten you out on this issue”.
