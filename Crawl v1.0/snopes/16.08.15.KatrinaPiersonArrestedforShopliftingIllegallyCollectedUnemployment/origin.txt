  On and off the campaign trail, congressional candidate Katrina Pierson sometimes discusses the hardscrabble background that she says ultimately made her a conservative firebrand.
 </p>
 <p>
  The troubles in her youth, records show, included an arrest for shoplifting.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 1997, five days before her 21st birthday, Katrina Pierson, then named Katrina Lanette Shaddix, was arrested on a charge of theft of greater than $50 and less than $500.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pierson, who is running against Dallas Rep. Pete Sessions in the March 4 Republican primary, acknowledges the mistake. She told police then, and repeated recently, that she was talked into shoplifting by a friend.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Like an idiot, I went along for the ride,” Pierson said in a recent interview.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to a Plano police report, Pierson said she and the woman with her, Laura Elizabeth Nelson, told police they needed the clothes for jobs they were trying to obtain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pierson told police she was “scared at first and did not want to go through with it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Pierson exited the store with four items of clothing in a shoe box inside her shopping bag. They were valued at $168. The report said Pierson had her young son with her when the incident occurred … Pierson, a tea party leader from Garland, said she knew her background would be open for scrutiny if she decided to take on Sessions, the powerful incumbent.
