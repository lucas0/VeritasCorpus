# Veritas

## Repo containing all versions of VERITAS dataset

The code used for the Crawling/Scrapping of each version can be found under the respective folders.

- **claim**
: the main claim verified by the FCA
- **claim_label**
: the label assigned to the verified claim
- **tags**
: keywords used by the FCA author to categorize the FCA
- **claim_source_url**
: the url of the identified origin (or an origin candidate, depending of the version) for that claim 
- **claim_source_domain**
: the domain of the claim_source_url, e.g.: nytimes.com is the domain for https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/world/covid-19-coronavirus.html
- **date**
: the FCA's publication date
