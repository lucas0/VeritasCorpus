http://www.emergent.info/bruno-mars-michel-jackson-son-hoax	Claim: A DNA test proved that Bruno Mars is Michael Jackson's son	false	['Bruno Mars', 'Celebrity Deaths', 'Fake News', 'Hoaxes']	empirenews.net	http://empirenews.net/dna-results-confirm-michael-jackson-is-biological-father-of-bruno-mars/	2015/01/05	DNA Results Confirm Michael Jackson Is Biological Father Of Bruno MarsPosted on| Like 0NEW YORK, New York – Vladimir Kershov, publicist of R&B singer Bruno Mars, has been fired today after he revealed a shocking secret regarding the pop and R&B singer. Kershov leaked private information that revealed that Michael Jackson is Mars’ biological father.In a statement emailed to news and media outlets across the world, Kershov revealed that he was told by the singer that DNA testing had proven that Jackson, known across the world as the King of Pop, was without a doubt his biological father. After pleading with Mars, born under the name Peter Hernandez, to go public with the revelation, Mars refused to do so. Kershov insisted that it be made known to the public, and that the news would catapult the singer’s fame and boost record sales. Mars remained adamant that the information not be released. According to Kershov, he then took it upon himself and emailed the shocking news to media sources all over the world.“DNA testing has proven that Michael Jackson is the biological father of Bruno Mars,” Kershov said in the statement. “Against his wishes, I have decided to relay this message for the greater good and betterment of Bruno’s life and extravagant music career.”In a statement released by Mars’ new publicist, Jacqueline Pryor, it has been announced that Kershov was immediately fired by the singer, and may seek legal action against his former publicist. “The job of a publicist is indeed to better the career of their clients by persuading them to take part in things that cause their popularity to grow, however, the client must trust their publicist. The artist has the final say, no matter what.”When asked about the validity of Kershov’s statement, Pryor surprisingly made it clear that the information is accurate. “It is true. Doesn’t mean he was right in saying so, but it is true. When it comes to 29-year-old Bruno Mars, Michael Jackson is the father!”
http://www.emergent.info/smaller-Apple-Watch-edition-price	Claim: The smaller gold Apple Watch Edition will cost $7,999 USD.	false	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Grail Watch', 'Stephen Foskett']	grail-watch.com	http://grail-watch.com/2015/02/16/gold-apple-watch-edition-must-cost-10000/	2015/02/16	b'The Apple Watch is a fairly large chunk of gold!Get ready for the tech press to flip out when Apple announces the retail price for the gold Apple Watch Edition model. Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling productsA that are more expensive than they should be, and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers. But the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $10,000. The funny thingA in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much!Do you disagree? Check out my counterpoint, The Case Against the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch EditionGold is ExpensiveLets start with a little backgrounder in gold.A Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people dont understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is.A So this is a good place to begin the discussion.Update: My calculations were wrong!A Also, this was a bit back of the envelope. Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back andA fix the calculations inA theA article to be more realistic...Here are the basic facts:Gold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years.18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law.One ounce of 18k gold occupiesA about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc.18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc..25 ccA of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8A cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!Gold Watches are ExpensiveLets apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equalA 15.12 cc of volume. But its a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So letsA just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10  32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200A as of this writing.A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would costA more than $3,200Now lets consider the same shapeA but just 2 mm thick. Thats 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and youre still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.How does this translate in the real world? Lets look at the retail price of some watches thatA are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.This Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k goldThe Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k goldCartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 streetCartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 streetTheA Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k goldJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 streetJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 streetThis list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, its pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.Then theres the bracelet. SwapA a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to thatA Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material valueA in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They cant priceA near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000Theres a reason I picked those twoA watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and theA Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but bothA represent a traditional watchmakers gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. ThatsA not going to happen. So theyre likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.First, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an estheticA standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot.A Second,A Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such.A Third,A the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.Could it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, solid in their press releases, they do claim it is crafted from 18-karat gold andA nowhere does it say it is plated or gold filled (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000.A It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, its hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.Gold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold isA twice as hard as standard gold.A Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cuttingA the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leavesA a few thousand dollarsA of material value in the case.A The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple WatchA Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave AppleA subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose its possible with some finagling and if thats the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.This is a $10,000 productBonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces inA certain Apple Store locations for the Edition.A I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sellA theA Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.Update!Needless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post,A I imagine Ill hear from lots of them real soon!The gist of theA disagreement lies in the amount of gold neededA for theA watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then theres the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX A (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.For fun, I took my Apple Watch models and used SW and some basic assumptions to figure the gold content. 29.16g: pic.twitter.com/WGEnjtj1Yh Greg Koenig (@gak_pdx) February 19, 2015I think this number is way too low, but its a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849A at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think hes way off but time will tell who is right and who isA wrong.Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch. Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition.A That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but its much, much smaller than the Apple watch and its circular to boot! A 34mm circleA is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference.A Use the magic of math to scale theA Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and were at 27.75 grams. But that caseA is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out withA $1,615 of gold in my mangledA square Rolex case.So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But lets take a step back andA think about the final price.A Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against theA volatility of the price of gold). So were back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported, If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.Regardless of the total, its important to realize that the price of gold is in the drivers seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.Id love to be wrong,A and I look forward to updating this piece.

http://www.emergent.info/Texas-Sharia-law	Claim: A jurisdiction of Texas is now under Sharia law	false	['Dallas', 'Sharia Law', 'Texas']	breitbart.com	http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2015/01/27/hold-islamic-tribunal-confirmed-in-texas-its-voluntary-says-attorney/	2015/01/29	Islamic Tribunal Confirmed in Texas; Attorney Claims ‘It’s Voluntary’Islamic Tribunal Websiteby Bob Price 27 Jan 2015 027 Jan, 201527 Jan, 2015An Islamic Tribunal using Sharia law in Texas has been confirmed by Breitbart Texas. The tribunal is operating as a non-profit organization in Dallas. One of the attorneys for the tribunal said participation and acceptance of the tribunal’s decisions are “voluntary.”Breitbart Texas spoke with one of the “judges,” Dr. Taher El-badawi. He said the tribunal operates under Sharia law as a form of “non-binding dispute resolution.” El-badawi said their organization is “a tribunal, not arbitration.” A tribunal is defined by Meriam-Webster’s Dictionary as “a court or forum of justice.” The four Islamic attorneys call themselves “judges” not “arbitrators.”El-badawi said the tribunal follows Sharia law to resolve civil disputes in family and business matters. He said they also resolve workplace disputes.In matters of divorce, El-badawi said that “while participation in the tribunal is voluntary, a married couple cannot be considered divorced by the Islamic community unless it is granted by the tribunal.” He compared their divorce, known as “Talaq,” as something similar to the Catholic practice of annulment in that the church does not recognize civil divorce proceedings as ending a marriage.He also said there is a difference between how a man and a woman can request a divorce under their system. “The husband can request the divorce directly from the tribunal,” El-badawi stated. “The wife must go to an Imam who will request the divorce for her.” He called it “two paths to the same result.” The practice of Khula is the process where a wife can initiate a divorce proceeding and where the husband can agree to the divorce in exchange for a financial compensation. It appears the wife must agree to give up any claim to the “dower” that was not already paid or to return it if it has already been paid. Once the financial issues are resolved the husband can then proclaim the Talaq (divorce).El-badawi said they follow Texas family law when it comes to child support, visitation, and custody. He said that in most cases, custody of children is awarded to the mother.Breitbart Texas asked what happens when there is a conflict between Sharia law and Texas law. El-badawi said most of the time, the laws are in agreement. When pushed further he admitted that, “we follow Sharia law.” However, he explained, “If the parties are not satisfied with the tribunal’s decision, they do not have to accept it and they can take the matter to Texas civil courts.” He did not say what the social ramifications of rejecting the “judge’s” decision would be.The website for the Islamic Tribunal states, “The courts of the United States of America are costly and consist of ineffective lawyers.  Discontent with the legal system leads many Muslims in America to postpone justice in this world and opt for an audience on the Day of Judgment.”It goes on to state, “It is with this issue that Muslims here in America are obligated to find a way to solve conflicts and disputes according to the principles of Islamic Law and its legal heritage of fairness and justice in a manner that is reasonable and cost effective.”In explaining Sharia law, the website states, “Stoning adulterers, cutting of the hands, polyandry and the like (all can be traced in the relevant literature and can be explained in their Islamic legal mentality and rational context in fairness and justice), are mainly a part of Islamic Criminal Law.  In fact criminal law within Islam only makes up a fraction of the Shari’ah.  It is unscholarly and unfair to generalize that type of understanding, that is Criminal Law, to compromise the whole of Islamic law if we stick to speaking in technical terms.”The website lists four “ judges :” Imam Yusuf Z.Kavakci, Imam Moujahed Bakhach, Imam Zia ul Haque Sheikh and Dr. El-badawi. It states the Islamic Tribunal resolves business disputes, divorce (Talaq) cases, community problems, serious family problems, and Khula.El-badawi restated several times that participation in the tribunal is voluntary. However, he would not discuss what happens to someone who did not follow their rulings.Bob Price is a senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas and a member of the original Breitbart Texas team.

Currently, the Big Mac has a whopping 550 calories and 29g of fat. The Apple pie contains 250 cal, and it would take a full 69 minute to walk that off! With that being said, those two menu items were not a tough decision for elimination.McDonald’s is currently testing out a new version of their slim down menu in Delaware, Little Rock, Waco, Bakersfield, Macon and Knoxville. They plan a full nationwide rollout beginning February 1, 2015.One notable “ingredient” – preservatives – might also be eliminated from the menu altogether. Mark Andrés, President of McDonald’s USA, sparked widespread speculation when he asked investors, “Why do we need to have preservatives in our food?” And then answered himself with a “We probably don’t.”What do you think about this new menu transformation at McDonald’s? In an attempt to make America healthier, do you think it will work?

They know who’s being naughty, and who’s being really naughty, things that even extensive online snooping couldn’t provide. Dildos, vibrators, chains — all the things stashed in closets and under beds.”Sources told reporters these were previously inaccessible to the government’s leading intelligence agency, if the owners paid cash at least.“If you want to know why the ‘privacy advocates’ have settled down, and moved on? My guess is, blackmail. These elves have accumulated petabytes of evidence against pretty much everybody,” Snowden said.“You wouldn’t believe what perverse things people will do to each other, right in front of these things,” Snowden concluded. “It’s why ‘ElfMonitor’ is such a highly sought after duty assignment.”Recommended For You:
http://www.emergent.info/human-death-GMO	Claim: Doctors confirmed the first case of death by genetically modified food	false	['Fake News', 'Hoaxes', 'World News Daily Report']	worldnewsdailyreport.com	http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/doctors-confirm-first-human-death-officially-caused-by-gmos/	2015/03/09	b' Share191K TweetMadrid| Doctors of the Carlos III hospital confirmed this morning in a press conference, the first case of human death caused by the ingestion of genetically modified food. Juan Pedro Ramos died from anaphylaxis after eating some recently developed tomatoes containing fish genes, which provoked a violent and lethal allergic reaction. This surprising announcement comes after the autopsy of the 31-year old Spanish man who died  at the Madrid hospital in the beginning of January. The young mans health rapidly deteriorated after he suffered an unexplained allergic reaction, and all the drugs used to refrain the anaphylaxis were entirely inefficient. The team of experts claims to have been able to determine that the genetically modified tomatoes that the victim ingested at lunch were the cause of the allergic reaction that caused his death.Mr. Ramos was working as a clerk in a Madrid warehouse on January 7, when he started feeling ill just after lunch. A number of symptoms started to manifest themselves, including a violent itchy rash, some serious swelling of the throat and a drastic drop in blood pressure. The man, who was known to have allergies, quickly injected himself some epinephrine, but his health condition continued to deteriorate.The young man was rapidly carried to the hospital by co-workers, but the medical staff was unable to identify the cause of his allergic reaction in time and none of the usual treatments or drugs seemed to work. Mr. Ramos was confirmed dead just over an hour after arriving at the hospital.The young man appeared happy and healthy when this picture was taken by his roomate, less than 24 hours before he died.The medical examiners and forensic experts at the Carlos III hospital had to execute a lot of tests and analysis before they could precisely determine what caused Mr. Ramos to die of an allergic reaction to seafood,  since all he had eaten before his death was a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich with a diet cola. They were astonished when they discovered that the tomato he had ingested, not only contained some fish-related allergens, but also some antibiotic resistant genes which had prevented Mr. Ramos white blood cell from saving his life.At first we thought that there had been some form of contamination of his food, from contact with fish or seafood during the preparation explained Dr. Rafael Perez-Santamarina. It was only when we tested the tomato itself that we noticed that it contained some allergens usually found in seafood. We did many different analysis and they all confirmed that the tomato was indeed the source of the allergens that killed Mr. Ramos. Many experiments on GMOs had produced some horrible tumors and event death in rats and other lab animals, but most genetically modified products on the market were considered to be harmless to humans.The case of Mr. Ramos is the first human death officially confirmed to be linked to the ingestion of genetically modified food. It contradicts most studies on GMOs which had concluded that genetically engineered crops currently on the market were completely safe to eat.A team led by University of Nebraska scientists had anticipated this kind of problem in 1996, when they found that a Brazil nut protein introduced to improve the nutritional quality of genetically modified soybeans was able to provoke an allergic reaction in people with Brazil nut allergies. However, this kind of problem was dismissed by most scientists as very improbable, since it could easily be avoided with proper safety testing. The soybean injected with the Brazil nut gene was indeed abandoned during development, but it seems that the genetically modified tomato that caused Mr. Ramos death had not been submitted to sufficient testing and the lethal risk had not been identified before it was marketed.The Spanish ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality ordered for the tomatoes of Portugese origin which infected the young man, to be recalled and removed from stores and markets for safety reasons. More than 7000 tons of tomatoes will therefore be ceased across the country by ministry inspectors and public safety officials.The ministry also issued a public statement about the death of Mr Ramos in which it sends its condolences to his family and adds that it will immediately demand further research on the subject to determine if other genetically modified food products on the European market could represent a risk for the Spanish population.

/* ]]> */												Over the course of investigating the Apple Watch, I’ve spoken to several sources who have spent extended time with it. There are a lot of interesting details, some of which we’ll get into. But, by far, the biggest recurring theme is how little you use your iPhone once you have one. After these discussions, it seems certain that the Apple Watch will shortly be the primary way you access your iPhone during the day. People that have worn the Watch say that they take their phones out of their pockets far, far less than they used to. A simple tap to reply or glance on the wrist or dictation is a massively different interaction model than pulling out an iPhone, unlocking it and being pulled into its merciless vortex of attention suck. One user told me that they nearly “stopped” using their phone during the day; they used to have it out and now they don’t, period. That’s insane when you think about how much the blue glow of smartphone screens has dominated our social interactions over the past decade. There are a few ways Apple is making this happen. Stay On The WatchThe Watch will have more context about you than a phone alone ever could. For example, it takes your heart rate periodically, providing you with a last-checked time, which could offer major benefits to health applications and other contextual processes. Here’s a tidbit you might not know — in order to receive notifications from apps, the Watch must be on your wrist and locked. The Watch requires contact with your skin to receive notifications. There will be no in-app dropdown notifications or constant pinging while it’s off your wrist. Push notifications also cease when the battery reaches 10 percent. Those decisions speak to the care with which Apple is handling notifications. The notifications are also different at an elemental level than the ones on your phone — both on the developer and user side of things. These are seen right away rather than at some point. You act on them quickly and they don’t stack up like they do on the phone. There is that added bit of context because you know exactly when they got it, which means that time-sensitive notifications like those that recommend a precise establishment or ping you during a live event become much more germane. One user told me that they nearly “stopped” using their phone during the day; they used to have it out and now they don’t, period. If you’re a developer who deals with notifications you know how powerful that could be. And, as a user, those notifications activate as part of the app right on the Watch home screen, allowing you to act on them without any sort of sliding, unlocking or other junk. These are immediate, actionable items that you can access without the obligations inherent in taking out your phone. MechanicsBecause the screen of the Watch is so small, there has been a lot of talk about its use as a “notification window.” Yes, notifications are a powerful part of it, but the mechanics of the device actually support much, much more than that. People that have used the Watch extensively say that the touch targets are actually very precise and sensitive. This means that you will be able to trigger smaller buttons and interactive elements fairly easily. (As a note, the unusual clustered home screen layout means that the “hot” spots for apps will be at the edges, rather than the center. This way you can jet out to the edge of a group in any direction and find an app. Your “bottom row” will become your “outer ring.”)The display is also very sharp and easily readable from your wrist. When your attention is on the Watch, you’re going to want to do more there than you think, rather than having to move over to your phone. This means that you may find yourself reading short articles and other content on your wrist. This could affect the way that publishers want to build their apps. They shouldn’t just be redirection machines that punt people to their phones; there is an opportunity to give people what they need now and let them get back to what they’re doing. Battery life is also much better than some previous reports, so Apple has been working on it. In a normal day of on-and-off use, the battery usually ends up at around 25 percent, which means that you should be able to make it through a full day. It only takes around two hours to charge fully. The digital crown is an important part of the navigation process and has been matched precisely to the scroll velocity. This should give a sense of context that helps when viewing on the smaller screen, as you’re not chasing the scroll with your finger. It’s also changed physically since the Watch was first shown off, and now has more friction for a weightier, higher-end feel. Pressing and holding the crown activates Siri, which sources have said works incredibly well on the Watch. It can be used for labeling, directions, commands executed by the phone and more. If — and this is a big IF as Siri has been hit and miss over the years for me — if it is truly a “say it and forget it” experience, the confidence in using your wrist as a “commander” for your life is expansive. Why Watch? So, let’s discuss. Does it kind of suck that we have to buy a $500 accessory to return to a normal life? Sure. But such is the deal. You’re not going to give up your smartphone. That Faustian bargain has already been struck. We get access to an entire universe of information and communication and we sacrifice our bloody attention on its smooth glass altar. But the Apple Watch can return some of that attention and, more importantly, time back to you. If you argue the Watch isn’t going to sell or do well, it’s worth pointing out that there are very, very, very few products that allow you to hand someone cash and be given back TIME. This will be the Apple Watch metric to track: time saved. We’re getting a tad metaphysical here, but really the only resource we all have exactly in common is time. Kings don’t have more of it than peasants. Not everyone will be able to afford an Apple Watch (or even an iPhone), but if they’re in an economic situation where that’s feasible then they’re also in the situation where they are probably willing to trade money for time. And that is the target market of the Apple Watch. Not “rich people” (though there’s a model specially for them), not “tech geeks” and not “Apple fanatics.” It’s people who want more time, and that is a very large target. This, for some reason, is the thing that Apple has had a hard time articulating. This is the primary use case of the Watch. It’s not just that it’s a “notification center”; it’s that it allows you to act without any additional distraction. For now, the iPhone is a dominant business for Apple and the smartphone is a domineering force in our daily lives. But one day something will come along to destroy it. And, as Apple has expressed many times in the past, it is willing to be the one that finds that thing. With the Apple Watch, we could be seeing the beginnings of that process. Perhaps someday, the Apple Watch could do the impossible: it could make you stop using your phone.

According to the websites, Rosenberg was taken hostage following three suicide attacks on sites where Kurdish fighters had barricaded themselves.The websites gave no further details regarding the circumstances of the capture, nor provided any proof of it.The Islamic State claims do not make clear whether Rosenberg was captured in Iraq or in Syria. The main battlefield between the Kurds and Islamic State is in the Syrian- Turkish border town of Kobani.Kurdish sources approached by Israel Radio reporter Eran Cicurel expressed doubt over the Islamic State report. They said Rosenberg was not in Kobani. In the assessment of these Kurdish sources, the reports of Rosenbergs capture are probably the terrorists propaganda.The Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) told The Jerusalem Post that there are no further details at this stage.Rosenberg wrote on her Facebook page on November 20 that she was handing over management of her account to someone else and would be without Internet access for at least two weeks, until December 8, she wrote. It is not clear where she went at this time.If the websites reports are true, Rosenberg would be the first confirmed Western female to fall into Islamic State captivity. Holding Israeli citizenship would complicate her situation even further.Unlike the US and the UK, which refused to negotiate over their respective captured nationals, thus giving the impression of a laissez-faire interest, Israel invests intense concern into the fate of its citizens captured by terrorists.This does not mean Israel will negotiate for Rosenberg, if she has indeed been captured  or that Islamic State would agree to talk with Israel, making her nationality Canadian alone.If Rosenberg is in captivity, she would be the second Israeli  of dual nationality  in this position. Steven Sotloff, a freelance American journalist who also held Israeli citizenship and filed for The Jerusalem Report on the Syrian civil war, was captured by Islamic State last year shortly after crossing the Syrian border and beheaded by the Islamist group this past August.As well, Rosenberg breached Israeli law by flying to Iraq, an enemy country, which Israeli citizens are forbidden to enter.No matter what has happened to her since joining the Kurdish forces, upon return to Israel she will be arrested and prosecuted, as was the case of several Israeli Arabs who joined Islamic State and subsequently returned to Israel.This is not Rosenbergs first tryst with adventurism  in 2009 she was arrested in an American con scandal and sentenced to four years in jail. This is, however, her first serious willful encounter with death.Rosenberg was born in Vancouver, and experienced a family crisis after her parents divorced. In an interview with Maariv in 2009, she said that already at the age of 22 she was pursuing a promising career as a pilot of Boeing passenger planes, but decided to leave everything behind and immigrate in 2006. In Israel, she joined the IDF, serving as an instructor for Kenyan soldiers who came to Israel for home front search and rescue training.Rosenberg said she had ambitions to join the Mossad, but was hurt during her military training and afterwards had money problems.She met an American friend in an ulpan Hebrew language course who led her into crime, she said.She joined a group of Israelis who were accused of setting up a ring to cheat elderly Americans and steal their money through a fake lottery scheme. According to the indictments filed against them, they stole hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps even millions, from the unknowing pensioners.After a number of complaints were filed, a joint Israel Police and FBI investigation was launched. The probe led to the arrest of several suspects and their extradition to the US, where they were tried. Rosenberg served four years in jail.She may have decided to fulfill an act of redemption after getting out of jail and regaining her freedom.Hopefully the Kurdish sources are right, and Rosenberg is indeed far from executioners.Canada is trying to confirm reports that Rosenberg has been captured, a foreign ministry spokesman said Sunday.Canada is pursuing all appropriate channels to seek further information and is in touch with local authorities, the spokesman said in a statement.Yossi Melman is an Israeli journalist and writer who specializes in security and intelligence affairs.

An inquiry was instituted against him in September, 1992 for major penalty for wilful absence from duty.Due to non-cooperation of Verma with the inquiry and for other reasons, it got delayed and a fresh charge sheet was issued in 2005.The inquiry report, establishing the charges was submitted in July, 2007 and the same was accepted by the then Minister of Urban Development in August, 2007. But no further action was taken in the matter.Seeking to streamline the functioning of CPWD and to ensure accountability, Naidu, soon after assuming office directed review of pending vigilance and disciplinary cases for expeditious action against the accused.Vermas case surfaced in due course and Naidu directed his dismissal from service.The Minister has taken serious view of in-action since 2007 and directed the concerned to fix responsibility for delay in the matterFor all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express AppMore Related News\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNo use of blame game, PNB fraud was due to systemic failure, says Venkaiah Naidu\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFreedom of speech requires regulation to protect others rights: Venkaiah Naidu\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags:Central Public Works DepartmentVenkaiah NaiduHhogachennJan 8, 2015 at 3:28 pmhahahaha...25 years it took to remove this roach??(0)(0) ReplyHhogachennJan 8, 2015 at 3:28 pmhahahaha...25 years it took to remove this man?(0)(0) Reply'

However, two days later, her mate was found dead and half-devoured. Shelter spokesman, Robert Konowal said: ‘The first two days were fine and they seemed to get on very well. ‘We were horrified when we then discovered she had killed him. ‘At first we couldn’t understand why but we took the remains to a vet who after examining him found that his testicle sack and private parts were underdeveloped.

http://www.emergent.info/apple-tv-hbo-now	Claim: HBO Now streaming subscription is coming to Apple TV	true	['Apple TV', 'HBO', 'International Business Times', 'Michael Learmonth']	ibtimes.com	http://www.ibtimes.com/hbo-talks-apple-be-launch-partner-coming-web-service-hbo-now-exclusive-1835882	2015/03/04	"By Michael Learmonth @learmonth On03/04/15 AT 2:28 PMGeorge R.R. Martin teased that some of the characters still alive in the books will die in ""Game of Thrones"" Season 5. Photo: Facebook/Game of ThronesHBO is in talks with Apple to make Apple TV a launch partner for its highly anticipated streaming service when it debuts next month. HBO and streaming partner Major League Baseball Advanced Media are working to have the standalone service, called “HBO Now,” ready to launch in April in conjunction with the premiere of the fifth season of “Game of Thrones,” according to sources familiar with the plan.When it launches, consumers will be able to subscribe to HBO Now directly from HBO for the first time, rather than through a cable, satellite or telco TV distributor such as Comcast or Verizon. The retail price is expected to be $15 a month when purchased directly from HBO, or about what consumers pay when they order HBO through their cable, satellite or telco provider.HBO’s corporate parent, Time Warner Inc., will rely on a whole new line of distributors (e.g., Apple TV, Roku, Xbox, PlayStation, Amazon, etc.) to help market HBO Now to an estimated 10 million U.S. broadband subscribers who do not pay for a cable TV bundle. CEO Jeff Bewkes has said the offering could also help reach some of the 70 million cable TV subscribers who do not subscribe to HBO but might if given the opportunity to subscribe online.HBO’s over-the-top service has been cast as the biggest challenge yet to the so-called cable bundle, in which consumers are required to buy packages of channels, some of which they may never watch. One study claimed the service would lead to a 7 percent drop in pay TV subscriptions , as users opt out of cable and opt in to HBO Now.Some cable providers, however, such as Cablevision and Cox Communications, have expressed interest in bundling HBO Now with broadband for their own subscribers who don’t get cable TV.Apple has been most aggressive in courting HBO in a bid to add the service to Apple TV, sources say. Apple TV already carries HBO Go for current HBO subscribers, but it may add a second app for HBO Now. Apple has spent the past several years negotiating for the rights to offer its own linear TV package; in the meantime, HBO Now is seen as an added service to drive adoption of Apple TV.While HBO has not confirmed a launch date for HBO Now, internally the target is an April launch, in time for the April 12 debut of “Game of Thrones.” That’s an aggressive time frame for Major League Baseball Advanced Media, which is building the back end along with a new front end separate from HBO Go. HBO is taking care not to launch HBO Now before it can guarantee that the service will work without some of the technical glitches that plagued HBO Go during last year's debut of cult-fave ""Game of Thrones.""The launch of HBO Now will be a milestone for Time Warner’s premium TV channel, which has for most of its 42-year history been distributed as an add-on to a package of cable channels. The Web service will allow HBO to sign on a new group of distribution partners, which it sees as no different than when it added satellite TV and, later, telcos such as Verizon and AT&T.Each of those distributors pays a wholesale price for HBO and then resells it to consumers for anywhere from $13 to $18 a month. Most see HBO as a retention device; those who subscribe are less likely to drop service or switch providers. HBO and Time Warner declined to comment.At $15 a month, HBO Now will be significantly more expensive than Netflix, which ranges from $8 to $12 a month for various levels of service, but cheaper than some were predicting. HBO makes the case that it has more original programming than Netflix and a better, more current film library. “It’s a premium product, and it will be priced accordingly,” HBO CEO Richard Plepler said during a Time Warner earnings call in February.HBO’s push to launch HBO Now comes after years of talking about launching an over-the-top service that bypasses traditional cable TV. Understandably, it has been met with some resistance from current distributors, including Time Warner Cable and Comcast, two companies in the midst of a $46 billion merger, according to sources.HBO, of course, heard the same misgivings from cable companies when it first added satellite TV providers and then telcos as distributors. HBO’s strategy is to give early partners a pricing advantage over newer ones; it’s unclear how this will go over with Apple, which has a track record of squeezing advantageous deals out of media, including the 99-cent single more than a decade ago.Bewkes said in December that he saw “cord-cutting” accelerate as pay TV providers dropped subscribers. U.S. pay TV providers lost 125,000 subscribers in 2014, according to Leichtman Research Group. At the same time, HBO and Cinemax reported their highest number of new subscribers (2.8 million) in 30 years.Among the challenges HBO faces to get HBO Now launched is how to avoid confusion with HBO Go, the service that allows HBO’s cable TV subscribers to access it on the Web, smartphones and tablets. The two services will have separate log-in pages and separate apps, but some cable execs are concerned about customer confusion. The explanation might challenge even the best call center employee: HBO Go is for TV subscribers to watch their content on devices; HBO Now for those who don’t subscribe via TV."

The Brazilian has been named by neighbours as the woman behind the massively popular DC Toys Collector YouTube account   DeJesus' videos, in which a mysterious woman 'unboxes' toys while narrating as she does so, have been watched a staggering 2.8billion times on YouTube, bringing the 29-year-old an annual income of almost $5m  The Brazilian went by the name Sandy Summers but is now living under the name Daiane de Jesus    Are these the hands of DC Toys Collector? Daiane DeJesus and her husband are apparently behind the site that has become a YouTube sensation   Seen here with a Teletubbies toy, the woman's nails always appear differently in each DC Toys Collector videoThe couple behind DC Toys Collector - previously known as 'Disney Collector' and one of the most popular videos on YouTube - has gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure their identities are not known.Attempts by the New York Times and BuzzFeed website to establish their identity failed, though they were able to pinpoint Florida as the location of those behind the channel - which is nothing to do with Disney itself.But Daily Mail.com has been told the identities of the pair by former neighbours and a close friend - and has used publicly available property records. Former neighbours who listened to the videos of DC Toys Collector are convinced that DeJesus is the voice behind You Tube's most successful channel.They became aware of her career as adult film star after she was spotted taking part in a photo shoot by the swimming pool in her back garden.RELATED ARTICLESPrevious1NextThe mystery woman who makes $5million from YouTube but...Giving the Nazi salute, chanting 'White Power' and pushing...Are you feline okay?

Four people who were independently shown a photograph of DeJesus taken by Daily Mail.com this week and published here said that it was their former neighbour.They pointed to a tell-tale scar on her left elbow and a mole just above her elbow joint as being identical to those that can be seen on Summers in many of her lingerie photo shoots.One neighbour who listened to the DC Toys Collector video and said immediately: 'That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere.'The neighbour, who declined to be named, said: 'Most people in the street eventually knew what she was up to.    DeJesus and her partner Messias Credido's old home in Winter Park, Orlando, where porn films featuring DeJesus as Sandy Summers and some of what were known as the Disney Collector videos were both made   The DC Toys Collector formula is simple, with the woman simply removing the toys from their packaging, demonstrating each part and sometimes assembling them for the benefit of her massive online audience   The videos are essentially a virtual tour of each toy, such as this Play Doh with a Finding Nemo theme   Maribel Barreto, an associate and ex-wife of Daiane DeJesus' partner Messias Credido, was approached by Daily Mail.com and showed the photos of DeJesus and Summers. She said they are behind the DC Toys Collector videos   In the DC Toys Collector videos only the narrator's hands and the product being unboxed are usually seen   This still is from the channel's most successful video, which has been viewed more than 200million times  DeJesus' career change means neighbours say she is now the figure behind the most lucrative account on YouTube   The user unboxes everything from Disney princesses to tubs of Play-Doh, including this Cars themed toy'Her husband said he ran a photographic business but he never left the house. That was strange.'We just thought they were so secretive we thought something had to be going on.'Then someone said we should look at Sandy Summers' website and it all clicked into place.'His wife added: 'In the photo you have of Daiane she has put on a bit of weight but that is unmistakably her.'That is our former neighbour. I used to chat with her quite a lot and was shocked when I learned what she did and what might have been going on at the house.'Another neighbour, who is in his 70s and asked not be named, said no one in the quiet suburban street spoke to DeJesus or her husband about their work in the porn industry.'We heard what they did but it was none of our business,' he said.Credido's ex-wife Maribel Barreto was also approached by Daily Mail.com and viewed the photos of DeJesus and Summers. The effect [of DC Toys Collector] is somewhat akin to crack for toddlers because of how you see them pining for it after its over.'  When asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen-faced and hurried away.'I have nothing to say,' she said as she sprinted into her apartment.But Barreto, who was divorced in 2011, had earlier confirmed that her ex-husband and his wife Daiane ran the DC Toys Collector site from their home in Orlando.She said: 'Yes, they are the Disney Collectors. I can't say any more.'  While DeJesus has done nothing illegal, many parents who allow their children to watch the videos might be dismayed to learn about the other graphic videos and photo shoots DC Toys Collector apparently took part in a decade ago.Attempts by Daily Mail.com to speak with DeJesus and her husband have failed as they have no phone listing and they do not accept unsolicited callers to the gated community where they now live. Neighbours in the upscale gated community confirmed that they know the blonde woman who lives with Messias Credido as Daiane DeJesus.The couple, who have an 18 month old son, were married on December 26th 2013, according to records lodged with Seminole County Court.Credido, who is also from Brazil, is behind another successful You Tube site called BluCollector.    DeJesus as she is today, with the mole near her elbow showing she used to be the porn star Sandy Summers  DeJesus was formerly well known as an adult performer (left) but now keeps a far lower profile (right)   DeJesus as Sandy Summers by the fireplace thought to be at the Winter Park, Florida home    The 29-year-old once made risque videos but the market for her YouTube channel now is toddlersIt is identical to the DC Toys Collector channel except it focuses mainly on toys for young boys.Both the BluCollector and the DC Toys Collector site are produced in exactly the same way.Shipping receipts seen by Daily Mail.com show toys being sent from Germany to the home address of Credido.Former neighbours in the Orlando suburb of Winter Springs where DeJesus and Credido lived said they would see deliveries from UPS and Fed Ex almost daily at their home.'There would be delivery trucks up to three times a day. We all wondered what was going on and what was being dropped off,' said a neighbour.Credido has been named as the man behind the Blu Collector by other media outlets.But until now the identities behind DC Toys Collector have been a closely guarded secret.The videos first began appearing on YouTube in 2012.They quickly became an online sensation attracting millions of page views and popular with children aged three and under because of their simplicity.The most watched video is called 'Play Doh Sparkle Princess' and has had more than 200 million views.Five other videos have received more than 40 million views, and another 15 have more than 20 million.The channel's 1,600 videos have been watched more than 2.4 billion times since being uploaded.One of the most recent, called 'LUNCH BOX SURPRISE Magnetic Dress-Up FROZEN', has already notched up more than 260,000 page views.The DC Toys Collector channel has more than 3.7m subscribers with a new video posted almost every day.     DC Toy Collector's local Toys R US store where she buys some of the products she features on her channel   The branch of Target where Diane DeJesus sources some of the toys for her usually daily video postsLike others on YouTube, DC Toys Collector is able to make money from the site from pop-up and banner adverts on the site.With so many children watching the videos on a daily basis it is an obvious choice for companies advertising toys to place their adverts within the short videos.Each time the DC Toys Collector site is watched, the producers are paid.Industry experts say they get between .60cents and $5 each time the page is viewed.Google, which owns YouTube, takes 45 per cent of any money earned.The company Open Slate, which analyses YouTube, estimated that in 2014 DC Toys Collector earned $4.9m.They reached the figure by looking at the account's subscribers, social media reach and average monthly view count. I call it first-person toy porn. I think it works because it's Christmas morning every minute. In the videos DC Toys Collector's face is never seen. Viewers only ever see her hands and hear her slightly accented voice.Each video always begins with the words: 'Hey guys, Disney Collector here'.The narrator, who has a slight accent, regularly uses the words 'adorable' to describe the toys and carefully unwraps each item before explaining its features.The videos are expertly produced with professional sound and lighting.A focal point of the videos are the brightly coloured fingernails that often feature toy characters intricately painted on them.The videos are said to have an entrancing effect on children who sit mesmerized as the toys are slowly opened in front of their eyes.Technology strategist David Williams told the NBC Today show in July 2014 that the effect on kids, including his own, was like 'crack for toddlers'.He told the show: 'The effect is somewhat akin to crack for toddlers because of how you see them pining for it after it's over'.Williams also told Buzz Feed: 'I call it first-person toy porn. I think it works because it's Christmas morning every minute.'Others have called the DC Toy Collector 'The Toy Whisperer'.   The pool and backyard area at the Winter Park house, where Sandy Summers made some of her videos according to neighbours   The entrance to the gated community where  DeJesus lives and is thought to make her wildly popular toy review videos   DeJesus has been able to move to the exclusive area apparently thanks to DC Toys Collector making $5m a year    Disney World resort in Orlando, Florida, close to where DC Toys Collector has its headquartersBut the couple have gone to great lengths to guard their privacy. No phone number is listed and their names are not even on the phone entry system at the gated community where they now live in Orlando. Property records listed with Seminole County list 44-year-old Credido as the buyer of a four-bedroom home set on a cul de sac in Orlando in April 2013.DeJesus' name does not appear on the records.Neighbours in the development contacted by phone confirmed that DeJesus lives at the address and is mum to an 18-month-old boy. According to fan websites DeJesus, or Summers, began her porn career when she was 20 years old in 2006.She lists her hometown as Lages in Santa Catarina, Brazil, and her date of birth as April 1986.On a webpage called Babepedia she says: 'I was born in a small town in Brazil called Lages. I love the sun, so when I moved to the US Florida seemed like the right place.'I miss some of my friends in Brazil, but I just love living here! I enjoy the simple life, but big cities have so much to offer; shopping for one! I am a shopoholic, definitely!'I speak Portuguese and English. What else can I say about myself? Just that I love to get naked.'In her career she has appeared on the cover of Penthouse magazine and other adult magazines as well as dozens of graphic videos.It appears she quit or reduced her involvement in the adult film business in 2009 with one fan asking on a site: 'Anyone know what has happened to Sandy Summers?'   Daily Mail.com tracked down Daiane DeJesus' partner Messias Credido's former wife Maribel Barreto   Ms Barreto confirmed that Mr Credido and Daiane de Jesus are behind the DC Toys Collector videos. She is pictured being shown a document with the reported annual income of DC Toys Collector   But when asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen faced and hurried awaySome of the photographs of Summers on adult sites appear to have been taken at their home in Winter Park.Many of the backdrops in the pictures are identical to those now being shown on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale.In one she is draped across a stone fireplace. That same fireplace is pictured on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale.DeJesus and Credido, who ran a now defunct photographic business called High Tec Photography, lived in Winter Park for almost seven years.The couple aroused the curiosity of neighbours as they were ultra secretive.One said: 'Messias said he was a photographer but he never left the house. They always made sure that no one would come into the house.'They were friendly when you bumped into them in the street, but they would not go out of their way to be talkative.'Another said: 'Word soon got around that Daiane was involved in some sort of adult work. No one liked to ask any questions but once we knew her working name we looked her up.'Publically available records with Seminole County show that the couple moved in April 2013 from Winter Park to a gated community in Orlando, paying $690,000 for a four-bedroom home.Daily Mail.com knows the exact location but has declined to publish it. It is also possible that Ms Barreto works with the couple on the DC Toys Collector website or even plays the part of the hands herself. However, she claimed to DailyMail.com that the couple are behind the production of the videos.Credido has also recently paid $300,000 for a plot of land in another gated community where he is expected to build a multi-million dollar home.Records filed with Seminole County court show that DeJesus and Credido were married on December 26, 2013. DeJesus is listed as a single woman while Credido is divorced.Her birth date is listed on the official form as April 1982 - four years different that Summer's on adult film websites containing her biographyDaily Mail.com has attempted to speak with the couple but they have declined to return any calls.

/* ]]> */												Over the course of investigating the Apple Watch, I’ve spoken to several sources who have spent extended time with it. There are a lot of interesting details, some of which we’ll get into. But, by far, the biggest recurring theme is how little you use your iPhone once you have one. After these discussions, it seems certain that the Apple Watch will shortly be the primary way you access your iPhone during the day. People that have worn the Watch say that they take their phones out of their pockets far, far less than they used to. A simple tap to reply or glance on the wrist or dictation is a massively different interaction model than pulling out an iPhone, unlocking it and being pulled into its merciless vortex of attention suck. One user told me that they nearly “stopped” using their phone during the day; they used to have it out and now they don’t, period. That’s insane when you think about how much the blue glow of smartphone screens has dominated our social interactions over the past decade. There are a few ways Apple is making this happen. Stay On The WatchThe Watch will have more context about you than a phone alone ever could. For example, it takes your heart rate periodically, providing you with a last-checked time, which could offer major benefits to health applications and other contextual processes. Here’s a tidbit you might not know — in order to receive notifications from apps, the Watch must be on your wrist and locked. The Watch requires contact with your skin to receive notifications. There will be no in-app dropdown notifications or constant pinging while it’s off your wrist. Push notifications also cease when the battery reaches 10 percent. Those decisions speak to the care with which Apple is handling notifications. The notifications are also different at an elemental level than the ones on your phone — both on the developer and user side of things. These are seen right away rather than at some point. You act on them quickly and they don’t stack up like they do on the phone. There is that added bit of context because you know exactly when they got it, which means that time-sensitive notifications like those that recommend a precise establishment or ping you during a live event become much more germane. One user told me that they nearly “stopped” using their phone during the day; they used to have it out and now they don’t, period. If you’re a developer who deals with notifications you know how powerful that could be. And, as a user, those notifications activate as part of the app right on the Watch home screen, allowing you to act on them without any sort of sliding, unlocking or other junk. These are immediate, actionable items that you can access without the obligations inherent in taking out your phone. MechanicsBecause the screen of the Watch is so small, there has been a lot of talk about its use as a “notification window.” Yes, notifications are a powerful part of it, but the mechanics of the device actually support much, much more than that. People that have used the Watch extensively say that the touch targets are actually very precise and sensitive. This means that you will be able to trigger smaller buttons and interactive elements fairly easily. (As a note, the unusual clustered home screen layout means that the “hot” spots for apps will be at the edges, rather than the center. This way you can jet out to the edge of a group in any direction and find an app. Your “bottom row” will become your “outer ring.”)The display is also very sharp and easily readable from your wrist. When your attention is on the Watch, you’re going to want to do more there than you think, rather than having to move over to your phone. This means that you may find yourself reading short articles and other content on your wrist. This could affect the way that publishers want to build their apps. They shouldn’t just be redirection machines that punt people to their phones; there is an opportunity to give people what they need now and let them get back to what they’re doing. Battery life is also much better than some previous reports, so Apple has been working on it. In a normal day of on-and-off use, the battery usually ends up at around 25 percent, which means that you should be able to make it through a full day. It only takes around two hours to charge fully. The digital crown is an important part of the navigation process and has been matched precisely to the scroll velocity. This should give a sense of context that helps when viewing on the smaller screen, as you’re not chasing the scroll with your finger. It’s also changed physically since the Watch was first shown off, and now has more friction for a weightier, higher-end feel. Pressing and holding the crown activates Siri, which sources have said works incredibly well on the Watch. It can be used for labeling, directions, commands executed by the phone and more. If — and this is a big IF as Siri has been hit and miss over the years for me — if it is truly a “say it and forget it” experience, the confidence in using your wrist as a “commander” for your life is expansive. Why Watch? So, let’s discuss. Does it kind of suck that we have to buy a $500 accessory to return to a normal life? Sure. But such is the deal. You’re not going to give up your smartphone. That Faustian bargain has already been struck. We get access to an entire universe of information and communication and we sacrifice our bloody attention on its smooth glass altar. But the Apple Watch can return some of that attention and, more importantly, time back to you. If you argue the Watch isn’t going to sell or do well, it’s worth pointing out that there are very, very, very few products that allow you to hand someone cash and be given back TIME. This will be the Apple Watch metric to track: time saved. We’re getting a tad metaphysical here, but really the only resource we all have exactly in common is time. Kings don’t have more of it than peasants. Not everyone will be able to afford an Apple Watch (or even an iPhone), but if they’re in an economic situation where that’s feasible then they’re also in the situation where they are probably willing to trade money for time. And that is the target market of the Apple Watch. Not “rich people” (though there’s a model specially for them), not “tech geeks” and not “Apple fanatics.” It’s people who want more time, and that is a very large target. This, for some reason, is the thing that Apple has had a hard time articulating. This is the primary use case of the Watch. It’s not just that it’s a “notification center”; it’s that it allows you to act without any additional distraction. For now, the iPhone is a dominant business for Apple and the smartphone is a domineering force in our daily lives. But one day something will come along to destroy it. And, as Apple has expressed many times in the past, it is willing to be the one that finds that thing. With the Apple Watch, we could be seeing the beginnings of that process. Perhaps someday, the Apple Watch could do the impossible: it could make you stop using your phone.

http://www.emergent.info/marines-weapons-yemen	Claim: The final Marines to leave the U.S. embassy in Yemen handed their weapons over to Houthi rebels	false	['Fox News', 'Marines', 'Megan Kelly', 'Yemen']	breitbart.com	http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/02/11/report-marines-ordered-by-state-dept-to-surrender-weapons-in-us-embassy-evac-in-yemen/	2015/02/14	by Jeff Poor 11 Feb 2015 011 Feb, 201511 Feb, 2015**Update added (see below)**In a report that aired on Fox News Channel’s “The Kelly File,” host Megyn Kelly revealed U.S. Marines stationed to guard the U.S. Embassy in Yemen were instructed by the State Department to surrender their weapons to local authorities upon the evacuation of those facilities.“[L]ate last night, the State Department ordering all personnel in the U.S. embassy in Yemen to pack up and get out,” Kelly explained. “Last month an Iranian-backed rebel group overthrowing the U.S.-backed government — it’s a group which you can see here, is not particularly fond of the United States, as they chant “death to America.” And now they are consolidating power and the security situation for Americans is rapidly deteriorating. Now tonight a senior defense official confirming to Fox News that Marines were directed to turn over their weapons before they were allowed to leave. According to one source the order came from the U.S. State Department. That is generating some serious outrage tonight especially among Marines who are taught from day one never surrender your weapon. At least one Marine telling Fox News, ‘Blank yeah, it pissed me off.’ Pardon me, his term. ‘I’m not giving up my weapon to anyone.’”UPDATE:The U.S. Marine Corp denied the report in a statement released Wednesday night:The Marine Security Force left the American embassy in Yemen for the movement to the airfield as part of the “ordered departure” with only personal weapons. All crew served weapons were destroyed at the embassy prior to movement. None of them were ‘handed over’ in any way to anyone. The destruction of weapons at the embassy and the airport was carried out in accordance with an approved destruction plan.Upon arrival at the airfield, all personal weapons were rendered inoperable in accordance with advance planning. Specifically, each bolt was removed from its weapons body and rendered inoperable by smashing with sledgehammers. The weapons bodies, minus the bolts, were then separately smashed with sledgehammers. All of these destroyed components were left at the airport — and components were scattered; no usable weapon was taken from any Marine at Sana’a airport.To be clear: No Marine handed a weapon to a Houthi, or had one taken from him.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poorRead More Stories About:Comment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

http://www.emergent.info/Boston-marathon-bomber-beaten	Claim: Boston marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was severely beaten in prison	false	['Bombing', 'Boston', 'Boston Marathon', 'Dzhokhar Tsarnaev', 'Fake News', 'Hoaxes']	empirenews.net	http://empirenews.net/accused-boston-marathon-bomber-severely-injured-in-prison-may-never-walk-or-talk-again/	2015/01/19	Boston Marathon Bomber Tsarnaev Severely Injured In Prison, May Never Walk Or Talk AgainPosted on| Like 0FORT DEVENS, Massachusetts – Infamous Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 22, was the victim of an “unfortunate accident” yesterday at Ft. Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts, just a few short months after his high-profile trial and sentencing, according to warden Paul Jacobson.Corrections officers reportedly found the terror suspect face down in a pool of his own blood in his cell; a banana peel was found on the floor nearby.“It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface, probably 16 or 17 times. There was blood everywhere – all over the walls, the floor, even the toilet. The injuries have caused massive brain trauma,” said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith. “We determined though, through expert analysis, that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall. Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev.”“Yes, it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber,” said Miles Smith, head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens. “The other gangs, they wanted him, too. We paid the guards the most money to have a shot. They stood aside, and let us do what we do. On the way out, they shook our hands, told us ‘Thank you.’ Well, You’re welcome. You’re welcome, Boston. You’re welcome, America!”“Normally, an attack this violent, this cruel, on another inmate would get any offending party more time added to their sentence,” said warden Jacobson. “Because of the nature of Tsarnaev’s crimes, though, we have decided to actually reduce the sentences of the Aryan members who were involved. They have done our prison and our country a great service, and we appreciate it immensely. They are heroes in the eyes of not only this institution, but also in the eyes of the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.”Tsarnaev had pled not guilty to all thirty charges filed against him, but was found guilty on all counts in April. He was sentenced to the death penalty per the crimes committed. 
http://www.emergent.info/19-million-watches-in-2015	Claim: Apple will sell 19 million Apple Watches in 2015	unverified	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Sales', 'BMO Capital Markets', 'Keith Bachman']	appleinsider.com	http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/03/06/bmo-forecasts-19m-apple-watch-sales-in-2015-with-more-than-half-selling-in-holiday-season	2015/03/06	"By Neil HughesFriday, March 06, 2015, 05:45 am PT (08:45 am ET)Momentum for the Apple Watch will likely take a short time to build driven mostly by apps, one analyst believes, with sales quickly escalating to 10 million units in the holiday 2015 shopping season.Keith Bachman of BMO Capital Markets believe Apple will sell 19 million Apple Watch units in calendar year 2015, with more than half of those being sold in the December quarter. His prediction was issued in a new note to investors this week, a copy of which was provided to AppleInsider.Bachman is bullish on the Apple Watch, but he believes it will take some time for applications to be built that will truly sell the public on the upcoming wrist-worn device.His estimates suggest there will be an installed base of more than 484 million iPhone users as of December 2015. Sales of 19 million Apple Watch units would equate to 3.9 percent of the total user base.For fiscal year 2016, Bachman believes Apple will sell 36.5 million of the Apple Watch, growing to 10.9 percent of iPhone users by September of 2016.Bachman's confidence in the Apple Watch comes despite the fact that there is still much not known about the wearable. In particular, he's especially curious to find out final pricing, application availability, and battery life.Regarding the high-end price point, BMO's analyst isn't concerned if the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition sells for more than $10,000. He suspects Apple will sell very few units at that price, as most high-end watch consumers will opt for a brand like Rolex that can stand the test of time.Bachman also isn't concerned about suspected battery life of around 24 hours. He noted that most consumers have become accustomed to recharging their iPhone at night by their bedside, and he expects Apple Watch users will do the same.BMO has maintained its price target of $135 for shares of AAPL, along with an ""outperform"" rating.Topics:"
http://www.emergent.info/Foley-ransom	Claim: The US threatened to prosecute the family of slain journalist James Foley	unverified	[]	abcnews.go.com	http://abcnews.go.com/International/government-threatened-foley-family-ransom-payments-mother-slain/story?id=25453963&singlePage=true	2014/09/23	"Video Appears to Show Beheading of US Journalist James FoleyNicole Tung/AP PhotoIn this Nov. 2012, file photo, posted on the website freejamesfoley.org, shows missing journalist James Foley while covering the civil war in Aleppo, Syria.Diane Foley told ABC News earlier this week that warnings over the summer came primarily from a highly decorated military officer serving on the White House's National Security Council staff. James Foley’s brother, Michael, also told ABC News that he was directly threatened with possible prosecution by a State Department official.“It was very upsetting because we were essentially told to trust… that the way they were handling things would bring our son home,” Diane Foley said.The U.S. government did try to rescue James Foley along with other American and European hostages from an ISIS stronghold in Syria in early July, but by the time the elite commandos arrived at the location, the hostages had been moved. Foley was executed weeks later by a self-professed ISIS militant.Digital GlobeThis satellite photo shows a compound on the Euphrates River just south of Raqqah, Syria where ISIS hostages, including James Foley, were believed to have been held in the Spring of 2014 based on descriptions by former hostages.Diane Foley said the family believed they knew where their son was being held prior to his execution, but other than the July rescue mission, it didn’t seem like anything was being done.“But we’re not politicians, we’re not government people, we don’t know,” she said. Diane Foley said the problem was that the family “had no idea” because the government didn’t tell them.At times, Diane Foley said the family “had to beg” the government for information on their son.“We were an annoyance, it felt, at some level… They didn’t have time for us,” she said.Today White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said that government officials were in constant contact with the Foley family and declined to comment on the alleged ransom warnings, telling reporters he’s “not going to be in a position to detail the kinds of conversations that took place so often between members of the administration and the Foley family.”“It is a long standing policy of this administration, it was the policy of previous administrations that ransoms should not be paid to terrorist organizations,” Earnest said before referring more specific questions about the Foley’s situation to the Justice Department .Secretary of State John Kerry today told reporters that he was “really taken aback [and] surprised” by Foley’s allegations. “I can tell you that I am totally unaware and would not condone anybody that I know of within the State Department making such statements,” Kerry said.State Department spokesperson Marie Harf today denied the State Department told the family they could be prosecuted for paying ransom, only that the department helps hostage families “understand what our laws are about terrorists or paying ransom to terrorists.”“But this department would never and did not ever intend nor do we think we ever did anything that we would consider threatening,” Harf said.Obtained by ABC NewsA screengrab from a video posted online appears to show American journalist James Foley shortly before he is killed by a masked captor.Thursday an NSC spokeswoman also said that the Foley family was informed of U.S. laws banning terrorism financing but denied the family was told they could face charges if they made a ransom payment.""Without getting into the details of our private discussions with families, the law is clear that ransom payments to designated individuals or entities, such as ISIL [ISIS], are prohibited. It is also a matter of longstanding policy that the U.S. does not grant concessions to hostage takers. Doing so would only put more Americans at risk of being taken captive. That is what we convey publicly and what we convey privately,"" NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement.The spokeswoman also asked ABC News to withhold the military officer's name for fear his personal security could be compromised by those who might wrongly blame U.S. officials for Foley's slaughter at the hands of ISIS militants who may never have considered sparing him for any price.Diane Foley did not disclose how much her family had raised before his high-profile public execution but she and a surviving son, Michael, said that the administration's intimidation tactics succeeded.""It slowed my parents down quite a bit. They didn't want to do anything that could get them in trouble. It slowed them down for months in raising money. Who knows what might have happened?"" Michael Foley said.The family launched the James W. Foley Legacy Fund this week, which in large part is intended to help other hostages' loved ones navigate the frustrating currents they encountered both with the terrorists and with their own government.Two American and several British hostages remain in ISIS captivity.Asked whether she had believed ISIS would accept a ransom payment and free their son, as they had many European hostages liberated for between $2-3 million each, Diane Foley replied, ""I do, maybe -- I mean, who knows?""""ISIS is a very brutal group. They may have already decided, that Jim and the others were Americans and they were going to kill him,"" Diane Foley said.In the end, Diane Foley said she didn't want to blame anyone for what happened to her son, but said that when it comes to the U.S. government’s treatment of the families of hostages, “As Americans, we can do better.”"
http://www.emergent.info/nhl-vegas	Claim: The NHL will announce an expansion to Las Vegas in 2014	false	['Las Vegas', 'NHL']	theprovince.com	http://www.theprovince.com/sports/Tony+Gallagher+Bettman+changed+tune+expansion/10150984/story.html	2014/08/27	Gallagher: Bettman has changed his tune on NHL expansionTony Gallagher (The Province)Updated: August 28, 2014  9:56 AMFiled Under:EmailNHL commissioner Gary Bettman says the National Hockey League will ‘listen to expressions of interest’ in adding teams.Photo by Mark HumphreyIt wasn’t very long ago that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman was treating talk of expansion as though he was being asked if he’d like an epidemic of Ebola.But recently the nature of the rhetoric has changed so much that the question is becoming not if, but when.And then the ultimate question. Will they be able to limit the number of new teams to just two?Sources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal, the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City.And given how dead set against a team in the gambling haven the commissioner was 10 years ago, this move into another player friendly state-tax-free zone represents a considerable about-face indeed.But people have been betting on hockey games for years and to pretend games couldn’t be fixed just as easily anywhere as in Vegas is pretty ridiculous, so that posturing has fallen by the wayside.A new team close to the newly renamed Arizona squad and California’s big three is all but assured, the only question being when and with which other city. Or should that be plural?With all the activity going on in the Seattle area in the last little bit it would be quite a stretch to imagine that much time and effort being spent by so many wealthy men being frittered away for nothing.At the moment there are no surefire plans to build a new rink, but that could change at any time with Vancouver billionaire Victor Coleman among many reportedly showing interest in putting an NHL team into the city.And Bettman hasn’t been visiting there to see if it really does rain a lot.It’s been 15 years since the NHL expanded — and given there are 16 teams in the east and just 14 in the west, taking in two more teams would certainly seem to make a lot of sense, the same amount of sense it made when realignment was first announced.And expanding without the players getting their mitts on any of the money other than the increase in payrolls is surely tempting, at least to those owners who remember the hefty cheques they cashed for Columbus and Minnesota.Whereas before the commissioner balked at expansion, this is a sample of his more recent verbal footwork:“There’s a lot of interest. We’re hearing from multiple groups in Seattle and in Vegas and Kansas City and Quebec City,” Bettman said to the Tribune while scoping out Target field in Minny for yet another trip to the well of outdoor games.“We have not decided to engage in a formal expansion process but we listen to expressions of interest. It’s not something we’ve seriously considered yet.”Like hell it isn’t. They’d have to be nuts not to be thinking about it seriously.And since then things have changed for a commissioner who hates to move teams in his league no matter how dire the circumstances might appear — one of the most likable aspects of his regime for most hockey fans. Once the league comes to your area, it is going to stay through thick, thin and the almost impossible, as seems to be the case in Phoenix.But could that long-standing policy and loyalty change with the Florida situation? True there’s a lease until 2028, but with the Panthers bleeding money, even the city of Sunrise can’t seem to see the point of carrying on much longer, so perhaps one of these new cities could get an existing team after all.And while Kansas City isn’t really likely to be a serious contender in this expansion soup unless they’re going to stretch it to four teams, saying no to Quebec City in favour of two more U.S. cities with no proven NHL backgrounds is almost certainly not going to happen.Going back to Minnesota has been a success, and there’s no question there’s more money and corporate backing than ever before in Quebec. Even an expansion team there in a new arena would be virtually assured of sellouts into perpetuity.There will be all manner of bleating about there being insufficient talent, of course, but even if it’s true, after such a long wait this trivial detail — which only troubles the fans — isn’t going to get in the way of a financial windfall like this.And any time the league decides it could use talent, they can start doing away with most of the coaches they employ whose chief calling in life is to devise ways to stop offensive players and choke the very life out of the game that’s paying their salaries.Expansion will be happening, and soon. The only question is how many new cities will be involved.

http://www.emergent.info/macdonalds-overweight-customers	Claim: McDonald's will stop serving overweight customers	false	"['Fake News', ""McDonald's""]"	dailybuzzlive.com	http://dailybuzzlive.com/mcdonalds-will-stop-serving-overweight-customers-beginning-1115/	2014/12/19	McDonald’s Will Stop Serving Overweight Customers Beginning 1/1/15Posted onby Daily Buzz LiveMcDonald’s Will Stop Serving Overweight Customers Beginning 1/1/15. So how will McDonald’s define overweight?Obesity rates in America have more than doubled over the last 2 decades and has become the leading public health issue in the U.S. With more than two-thirds of the adult population overweight, McDonald’s has decided to become part of the obesity rate solution – not the problem.According to reports, beginning January 1, 2015, McDonald’s will no longer serve customers who show risks of being overweight. They will define overweight by these standards: Over 170 lbs for women and 245 lbs for men. Children’s weight restrictions will vary depending on age and height.McDonald’s is currently running campaigns to shake its “junk food” image, insisting they sell nothing but good quality food. They are are branding themselves from “A dining experience of fast food” to “Good food served fast.” They want people to understand the risks of being overweight.So how will they know if you are overweight ? Will they ask you what you weigh and trust your answer? NOThey are implementing scales at the from of every register just like the one in the photo below. You must stand on the scale when ordering or you will not be served. They also plan on posting signs to let customers know that they have the legal “Right to refuse service to anyone.” For drive-thru patrons it may be a bit more difficult to enforce. However, if the person looks like they exceed the weight restrictions, they will be refused service at the drive-thru window.
http://www.emergent.info/high-school-trader-worth-72-million	Claim: A N.Y. high schooler earned $72 million in the stock market	false	['NYC', 'Stock Market']	nymag.com	http://nymag.com/news/articles/reasonstoloveny/2014/mohammed-islam-stock-trading/	2014/12/15	"ShareThis(Photo: Bobby Doherty)Editor's Note: In the most recent edition of New York, its annual Reasons to Love New York issue, the magazine published this story about a Stuyvesant High School senior named Mohammed Islam, who was rumored to have made $72 million trading stocks. Islam said his net worth was in the ""high eight figures."" As part of the research process, the magazine sent a fact-checker to Stuyvesant, where Islam produced a document that appeared to be a Chase bank statement attesting to an eight-figure bank account. After the story's publication, people questioned the $72 million figure in the headline, which was written by editors based on the rumored figure. The headline was amended. But in an interview with the New York Observer last night, Islam now says his entire story was made up. A source close to the Islam family told the Washington Post that the statements were falsified. We were duped. Our fact-checking process was obviously inadequate; we take full responsibility and we should have known better. New York apologizes to our readers.Rumors, on Wall Street, can be powerful. A whisper can turn into a current that moves markets, driving a stock price up or sending it tumbling. There may be only one other place where gossip holds such sway, and that is high school.Late last year, a rumor began circulating at Stuyvesant that a junior named Mohammed Islam had made a fortune in the stock market. Not a small fortune, either. Seventy-two million.An unbelievable amount of money for anyone, not least a high-school student, but as far as rumors go, this one seemed legit. Everyone at Stuy knew that Mohammed, the soft-spoken son of Bengali immigrants from Queens and the president of the school’s Investment Club, was basically a genius.As the news spread, Mo’s stock went up. The school paper profiled him, Business Insider included him on a list of “ 20 Under 20 ,” and Mo became “a celebrity,” as his friend Damir Tulemaganbetov put it on a recent Friday night at Mari Vanna near Union Square. “A VIP!”Mo, a cherubic senior with a goatee and slight faux-hawk, smiled shyly. “He’s quiet today,” said Patrick Trablusi, who was seated with Mo and Damir at a table littered with empty glasses. “Humble.” And tired: “This is our third meeting of the day,” Damir said, signaling to the waitress for another round. “We saw a real-estate agent, a lawyer, you …”“Next we’re going to see a hedge-fund guy,” Patrick said. The friends locked eyes and started to giggle.“He basically wants to give us $150 million,” Mo explained, a blush like a sunset creeping over his cheeks.The waitress arrived with a tray of green drinks. “Freshly squeezed apple juice,” Damir said, passing them around. “It’s very good. Do you like caviar?”After Mo became a celebrity, things got a little awkward at school. (“Aren’t you the kid who made all that money?” a teacher asked him.) So he “reconnected” with kids from his old school, Allen-Stevenson. One of them introduced him to Patrick, an aspiring financier, who introduced him to Damir at a poker game attended by kids whose parents are, according to Damir, “the one percent of the one percent.”The son of a Kazakh oligarch, Damir is tall, slim, and cocky, like a cigarette wearing a fedora. “I call the poker game ‘Destiny,'""he said. The waitress arrived with a plate. “Here, have some caviar.”Over late nights out and dinners at Morimoto, the three hatched a plan to start a hedge fund. “There are a lot of steps we have to follow through,” said Patrick, calling to mind a more serious Chuck Bass. “But we’re on the right track.” They plan to launch in June, after Mo turns 18 and can get his broker-dealer license. “Mo’s our maestro,” Patrick said. “He’s going to be earning the big bucks. We’re just going to try to fill his needs.”All three plan to attend college next year, but they’re not concerned about classes getting in the way of their goal: “A billion dollars!” Damir said. “By next year!” Mo affirmed the number with a nod. “But it’s not just about money,” he added. “We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence, like the Koch brothers …”“Like in Wolf of Wall Street!” Damir interjected. “And Mo is Jordan Belfort.”“No, but, not like that,” Patrick said, blanching slightly.Like Belfort, Mo started with penny stocks. A cousin showed him how to trade. He loved the feeling of risk—the way his hand shook making the trade—but he swore it off after losing a chunk of the money he’d made tutoring. “I didn’t have the balls for it,” he said. He was 9.It was a while before he was ready to try again. In the meantime, he became a scholar of modern finance, studying up on hedge-fund managers. He was particularly enamored of Paul Tudor Jones. “I had been paralyzed by my loss,” Mo said. “But he was able to go back to it, even after losing thousands of dollars over and over. Paul Tudor Jones says, ‘You learn more from your losses than from your gains.’ ” Mo got into trading oil and gold, and his bank account grew. Though he is shy about the $72 million number, he confirmed his net worth is in the “high eight figures.” More than enough to rent an apartment in Manhattan—though his parents won’t let him live in it until he turns 18—and acquire a BMW, which he can’t drive because he doesn’t yet have a license. Thus, it falls to his father to drive him past Tudor Jones’s Greenwich house for inspiration. “It’s because he is who he is that made me who I am today,” Mo said.Which is to say: a believer in Wall Street. “A lot of young people do start-ups, but I think it’s a bubble. Trading and investments will always be there. Money will always be rotating—”“Money never sleeps!” Damir added. “That’s from the Wall Street movie.”“It all comes down to this,” Mo continued. “What makes the world go round? Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses don’t keep going, there’s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.”The check arrived for the caviar and apple juice. It totaled $400.“New York, that’s where the money’s at,” Damir shouted, pulling out a credit card.This reminded me of an old joke about robbing banks because that’s where the money is. Damir grinned. “My father has a quote,” he said. “It’s really dope: ‘You can rob a bank with a gun, but you can rob the whole world with a bank.’ ”Patrick buried his face in his hands. “At the end of the day,” he said, “we’re young kids.”"
http://www.emergent.info/texas-turkey-farm-ebola-hoax	Claim: A Texas turkey farm was contaminated with Ebola	false	['Ebola', 'Fake News', 'Texas']	dailybuzzlive.com	http://dailybuzzlive.com/texas-turkey-farm-contaminated-ebola-holiday-turkeys-infected/	2014/11/16	Texas Turkey Farm Contaminated With Ebola, Over 250,000 Holiday Turkeys InfectedPosted onby Daily Buzz LiveTexas Turkey Farm Contaminated With Ebola, Over 250,000 Holiday Turkeys Infected.A Texas turkey farm employee is now under quarantine after he tested positive for the Ebola virus. Texas Prime Turkey Farm, the largest supplier of turkeys in the United States, has been ordered by the CDC to quarantine over 250,000 holiday turkeys. The CDC has confirmed 3,000 turkeys have tested positive for the virus since Friday’s incident.According to investigators, long time employee Philip Canseco was seen vomiting in the facilities restroom three days prior to the incident on Friday. “I was passing by the restroom, when I heard somebody throwing up inside,” said one Texas Prime Turkey Farm employee. “I opened the door and looked inside and saw Canseco throwing up in one of the urinals. I asked him if he was okay, he said yes, and I left. I didn’t want to get close to him and get sick.”Management confirmed that Canseco worked three full work days at the facility with flu-like symptoms, before passing out unconscious with a fever of 106°. Due to his symptoms, he was rushed to a local hazmat tent where he tested positive for the Ebola virus. The CDC reports an additional 7 coworkers are being quarantined and tested. However, they have not released those results as of yet.The facility has been ordered by the CDC to burn their entire flock of turkeys, over 250,000. Texas Prime Turkey Farm is requesting permission from the state of Texas to send the shipment of incinerated turkey ashes to Veolia’s Port Arthur environmental waste facility. This facility has already accepted one shipment of Ebola waste from household goods where Thomas Eric Duncan had stayed. Duncan was the first man to die of  Ebola on US soil.Activists are protesting the shipments of contaminated Ebola waste to their community. “We feel every precaution should be taken to protect our community, our children and our elderly. We are not a dumping ground for the nations, or the world’s bio waste.”Plant manager Mitch Osborne said on Saturday that even though no contract has yet been signed, the plant will likely receive the second shipment of contaminated Ebola waste. “It is a safe and sound process,” Osborne said. “I am not going to place my employees in harms way, or the community. The company is here to improve the environment and I believe we are doing a pretty darn good job of that. I believe we are doing the right and safe thing.”A spokesperson for Texas Prime Turkey Farm said there is a good chance Ebola turkeys may have already shipped out to major suppliers for distribution. Each retailer will have to perform recalls individually if they feel they have received a contaminated shipment.

The movie will take place from the day Jax was born, and leads up to the era just before Sons Of Anarchy began as a series.”Sutter also said that he is really happy to bring Ryan Hurst back as Opie Winston, and hopes fans will forgive him for killing Opie off. “Man I tell ya, when we killed Opie off, it was like the thing turned real. I’ve never gone public with this, but I’ve had people get really crazy when they see me in public,” said Sutter. “They shout at me, and they get angry – ‘You shouldn’t have killed Ope! I hope you rot in Hell!,’ that sort of thing. I had people try to run me off the road when they recognized me, although that just might be because I’m kind of a dangerous driver. Anyway, my hope is that this film will help them cope.”Sutter says pre-production on film will begin in the middle of 2015, and will begin shooting sometime in the fall. “For a movie of this scope, with this much storyline attached, you should expect to see the film by the end of 2016,” said Sutter. “In the mean time, buy all the official Sons of Anarchy merchandise you can. Every dollar goes to helping get this movie completed. Brad Pitt isn’t cheap, you know.” 
http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Edition-cost-10k	Claim: The larger Apple Watch Edition will cost $10,000	true	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Grail Watch', 'Stephen Foskett']	grail-watch.com	http://grail-watch.com/2015/02/16/gold-apple-watch-edition-must-cost-10000/	2015/02/27	b'The Apple Watch is a fairly large chunk of gold!Get ready for the tech press to flip out when Apple announces the retail price for the gold Apple Watch Edition model. Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be, and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers. But the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $10,000. The funny thing in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much!Do you disagree? Check out my counterpoint, The Case Against the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch EditionGold is ExpensiveLets start with a little backgrounder in gold. Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people dont understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is. So this is a good place to begin the discussion.Update: My calculations were wrong! Also, this was a bit back of the envelope. Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic...Here are the basic facts:Gold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years.18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law.One ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc.18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc..25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!Gold Watches are ExpensiveLets apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equal 15.12 cc of volume. But its a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So lets just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10  32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing.A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost more than $3,200Now lets consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick. Thats 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and youre still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.How does this translate in the real world? Lets look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.This Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k goldThe Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k goldCartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 streetCartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 streetThe Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k goldJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 streetJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 streetThis list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, its pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.Then theres the bracelet. Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They cant price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000Theres a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but both represent a traditional watchmakers gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. Thats not going to happen. So theyre likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.First, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot. Second, Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such. Third, the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.Could it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, solid in their press releases, they do claim it is crafted from 18-karat gold and nowhere does it say it is plated or gold filled (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000. It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, its hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.Gold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as standard gold. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case. The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose its possible with some finagling and if thats the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.This is a $10,000 productBonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition. I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.Update!Needless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post, I imagine Ill hear from lots of them real soon!The gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then theres the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX  (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.For fun, I took my Apple Watch models and used SW and some basic assumptions to figure the gold content. 29.16g: pic.twitter.com/WGEnjtj1Yh Greg Koenig (@gak_pdx) February 19, 2015I think this number is way too low, but its a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think hes way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong.Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch. Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but its much, much smaller than the Apple watch and its circular to boot! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference. Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and were at 27.75 grams. But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out with $1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case.So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But lets take a step back and think about the final price. Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold). So were back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported, If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.Regardless of the total, its important to realize that the price of gold is in the drivers seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.Id love to be wrong, and I look forward to updating this piece.

http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-Edition-price	Claim: The gold Apple Watch Edition will start at $4,999 USD	false	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Gene Munster', 'Piper Jaffray']	appleinsider.com	http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/03/02/piper-jaffray-pegs-stainless-steel-apple-watch-price-at-499-edition-at-4999	2015/03/03	"By Mikey CampbellMonday, March 02, 2015, 06:55 pm PT (09:55 pm ET)Investment firm Piper Jaffray issued a report on Monday breaking down expected Apple Watch average selling prices, saying an aggregate of consumers will likely spend closer to $550 on the device, considering case and internal storage options.Building off Apple's quoted starting price of $349 , analyst Gene Munster anticipates combined Apple Watch ASPs to fall closer to $550, or $575 to $600 including additional bands.Apple Watch will come in three separate price tiers —Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition —each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices.Starting with Apple Watch Sport, the aluminum and glass version widely thought to be the least expensive model, Munster expects an ASP of $450 after factoring in configuration alternatives like case and internal storage options.The stainless steel Apple Watch model, which also features a more expensive sapphire glass cover, is expected to start at $499 to $549, again depending on customizable features. Munster sees an overall ASP at around $650 for the mid-tier Watch series.On the high end, the analyst forecasts base model Apple Watch Edition devices to start at $4,999, but classifies segment ASP closer to $7,500 after adding in straps made from precious metals.Based on current pricing for Apple's silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars.""If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,"" Munster writes.He added that if half of all Watch buyers purchase a band —assuming 8 million Watches are sold in 2015 —the accessory range would add $25 to Apple's watch category, equating to a $575 ASP. If every Watch customer purchases an extra strap, it would tack on $50, bringing ASP up to $600.The lower-cost Sport model is expected to make up 55 percent of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take another 45 percent. That leaves very little room for Apple Watch Edition, but Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year. In an interesting comparison, the firm calculates that Apple Watch Edition business could equate to about two percent of luxury watchmaker Rolex, which moves between 600,000 to 750,000 units each year.Finally, Munster expects Apple to reveal a better sense of device pricing at its March 9 event , as well as highlight ""special features"" to drum up consumer interest ahead of release.AppleInsider will be covering the ""Spring forward"" event live from San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center next week.Topics:"

He was 81 years old. Rumors of Nelson’s death first circulated early July 21, 2015 on social media outlets but was later confirmed by police.A groundskeeper scheduled to perform yard maintenance on Nelson’s property reportedly found the singer/songwriter unresponsive on the front lawn and immediately called 911.“There was no evidence of drug abuse or alcohol and no signs of foul play,” said Det. Aldeson.“Determining an official cause of death could take as long as 3 weeks,” said County Coroner Frank Shultz. “It’s just too early to tell what caused his tragic death.”The shocking news comes just days after a recent “60 Minutes” interview where Nelson was quoted as saying “Life is good and I have never felt better or been happier.”This story is still developing and all information is not yet officially verified.Related Posts

She also used the meat of the cats to lure other cats who unwittingly were eating their own species, a disgusting and cruel hobby admits local PETA spokeswoman Jane Churchill.I cant believe these atrocities happened in our own backyard. Animals are our brothers and sisters and what she has done to my eyes is comparable to mass murder she explains. She has taken the lives of hundreds of cats just to make fur coats out of them, this is tragic. How would people react if someone made coats out of human skin? These cats are living beings and all living beings are equal to Mother Earth.

I now know that these are “adults” who just cannot handle the fact that I have the right to make choices, and that these choices ultimately hardly even affect them.1/17/15 – Editor’s note: Due to the large number of interview requests, I have extended an invitation to the author to post her response to the comments and general negative feelings towards her. I will post an update as soon as she responds.In the spring of 2012, I found out that I was pregnant. I had a good idea who the donator was, but money wasn’t really an issue, and I knew that I would be a good mother-like figure for the child by myself. I have always believed in the right for all women to have a choice in terminating their pregnancy, but when I confirmed the diagnosis about a month into into it, I decided that I WAS ready to have this child.My journey has taken me to many different places fighting for women’s rights and carrying the banner of the Feminist Movement, even to the point of eschewing a career. One of the more prominent themes that I saw in these places was that men generally would look down on us, refuse to help us, or hardly even lend an ear so that we could air our grievances. This didn’t surprise me, the patriarchy has been well entrenched since the dawn of time, but here I was, here I am, ready to change it.One of the more alarming incidents happened while I was on my way to San Francisco to participate in an Occupy Wall Street rally. I sat down in my seat on the plane, which happened to be extra full for that day, and a particularly well dressed man happened to be sitting in the seat beside me, in the aisle. After takeoff, he asked me what I was going to San Francisco for, while I generally wouldn’t talk to a man sitting next to me on an airplane, I told him I was going to the OWS rally.The man literally scoffed when I spoke those words and leaned in and quietly said to me “B****** like you need to learn their place”. Stunned, I screamed “ASSAULT!” while other passengers looked at us, the woman across the aisle from him immediately told him to get away from me, but not 5 seconds passed before a flight attendant had rushed over to intervene. [sociallocker id=”86″] As I explained to the flight attendant what had happened and I demanded to move seats, I was told that there were only 2 other open seats available, both back in Economy.*Trigger warning* – Extreme patriarchyBy this time, a male flight attendant was on the scene and I told him to have the man moved. The woman-hater just laughed as the flight attendant continued to press me on if he made any physical contact with me. For a moment, I contemplated bending the truth in order to get the woman-hater away from me. His words had violated both my feelings, and my trust, perhaps as much of a violation as actual physical touch. In the end, I confirmed that no physical contact was made, to which both flight attendants told me they couldn’t make him move.I was flabbergasted, and then betrayed as they recommended that I move to one of the empty seats. This left me in tears. I knew the only way to get away was to move seats so I did so tearfully and having felt as though I had been verbally and emotionally raped.By the time we landed, my outlook had changed, I could no longer depend on men to be an ally of the cause.As spring turned into summer and my belly started to grow, my mind ran wild with the thoughts of teaching my daughter from a young age tolerance and feminist ideals. Choosing the right all-girls daycare, then elementary school, all so that she could grow up and thrive in an environment where women are told that they can do anything that they want to do. No man will be around to hurt her progress, no boys there to demean her or call her names.I had already started buying gender neutral clothing since I did not want outside influences affecting what gender she would ultimately become. My research on nannies one day came to an abrupt end when my cell phone alarm went off – time for my 5 month appointment. These early appointments had gone well enough, my baby was progressing in a healthy manner.Today, my doctor, who I will call “Sandy” did an ultrasound and everything appeared to be fine. “Would you like to know the gender?” Sandy asked. I thought to myself “That machine is an ultrasound, not a crystal ball, you couldn’t tell me the gender of my baby even if you wanted to”“Sure” was my response.“It’s a boy”…..……“What?” I managed to sputter. Sandy then showed me on the ultrasound how exactly my body had betrayed me even worse than the misogynistic suit jockey on the airplane so many months before. I was in shock, I started crying, weeping at the thought of what I was about to curse the world with.On my way home, my driver asked if I was ok and if I needed anything. “JUST STOP RIGHT HERE” I yelled. Deciding to walk the 4 blocks back home. My home became my prison and my fetus became my warden the next 48 hours. Crying, sobbing, uncontrollable weeping, mental anguish the likes of which may only be experienced by those who have had their lives destroyed by war, I was a refugee, and my home was my refugee camp, an unfamiliar place that was just….sheltering me.By the third day, I started regaining some of my mental strength and knew what I had to do. I couldn’t bring another monster into the world. We already have enough enemies as it is. It didn’t matter that I would be raising a son, he would still come into contact with boys, men, perhaps even the suit jockey who would inevitably twist his carefully constructed upbringing with their kindness. He would think “These men aren’t so bad, why would mom say that they are holding me down?”Not all men are bad, my driver showed genuine concern for my well-being that day and I may have taken my anger out on him. That may have been uncalled for. But I knew what I had to do.A few days later, I went in for the procedure, as it was fairly later in my pregnancy, I was aware there were certain risks, but it went off without a hitch. My body’s betrayal was no more, I was free, and for the first time since the airplane incident, I felt strong. I had done something positive, something that would actually make a difference, something good, even though as I would find out, many others wouldn’t see it that way.Today, I have a beautiful 1 year old female who will hopefully grow up to be just as strong and driven as her mother. I have endured a lot regarding my first pregnancy, but I don’t care. Sometimes, even allies will turn on you, but I don’t care.I stand by my decision to abort my baby because it was a male.I don’t hate men, I hate the patriarchy, what men, and even some women, turn into, I wasn’t going to let that happen with my offspring. The chances were greater that it would with a male, it was unacceptable.If the curse returns, I would do the exact same thing all over again.[/sociallocker]30 thoughts on “I Aborted My Baby – Because it was a Boy”My internet name says:TL:DR womans meets an asshole on a plane, who happens to be a man, falsely claims assault and 5 MONTHS aborts a boy because it’s a boy EVEN THOUGH she made a point of raising her girl gender neutral.Dave Spiller says:Doesn’t all-girl daycare and schooling just reinforce the gender divide, telling boys and girls they are defined by their sex?Totally says:No no no, this is gender equality did you even read the tags. It’s all good, all good.Sammy says:January 17, 2015 at 10:11 amThis is not meant to be hateful or condescending so please please read this.  I feel like you’re taking the wrong mentality with this.  Part of how we change society is by teaching our children.  If your child is a boy, you can help change society by teaching him that misogyny is wrong and to treat women with respect and equality.  He would then, in turn pass that on to his children, and so on, and so forth.  I’m not saying a girl doesn’t also have the power to change things for the better but when the issue lies with the way men think, you had a chance to bring a respectful male into the world who would then be helping to pass on that mentality.  I support a woman’s right to an abortion because there are several reasons why it might be necessary.  Be it an inability to care for the child, the woman’s life being in danger, or an unwanted pregnancy due to rape, just to name a few.  However I feel the gender of your child is not a valid reason as it’s extremely superficial and even somewhat hypocritical, especially when gender is a social construct anyway.  Nothing can be changed and what you’ve done cannot be taken back so I won’t dwell on it and berate you for it but I do sincerely hope that if you ever have any more children, please give them all an equal chance, regardless of gender.  If the child is a boy, use it as an opportunity to teach them what’s right so they can pass it down.  If the child is a girl, then teach them to be strong like you currently are with your daughter.  The gender of your child should never matter and by being selective, all you’re doing is supporting inequality in either gender.Disa says:January 27, 2015 at 10:33 amAGREED! Doesn’t matter the gender of your child, it is your child so you get to teach them what you think is right and they will pick that up and teach it to more people, male or female. Boy children are not born with any hatred for women. They are born with compassion and love for their mother and or other caretaker. Their mother, father, or other caretakers are who teach the child who to hate, not their assigned gender.Ashish says:’’Teach them to be strong like you currently are’’….Sabrina Parnas says:January 17, 2015 at 12:42 pmYou are a sick and twisted individual. A man hater like no other. Having a young child that is male, it makes me think that you could just abort it because it was a boy. You don’t deserve to have children if you discriminate based on their sex. You are no worse than all the men who are misogynist.Although I am very much pro choice, I find your reasoning flawed and disturbing. I hope you won’t damage your child with your vitriol.And where is the gender equality, if you are ready to abort at the first sign that it is a boy.Michael G says:January 17, 2015 at 2:39 pmYour loss.  Your son would have loved you with all his heart.  You would have been the most beautiful woman in the world to him.  You would have been the most important person in his life forever.You won’t know the caring, loving man he could have been. You won’t know how great men can be…how great your son could have been. Your loss.Paul says:January 29, 2015 at 4:50 pmWhy is his value defined in terms of what he could do for her? He has value just because he’s human. I think the greater loss is his but I dread to think what his life would have been like with a mother like that.Yeah I'm going to remain anonymous... says:This almost made me cry I’m a sucker for words of sadness…but so trueCorey says:You are not a Feminist. You are a misandrist, plain and simple.Jen says:that’s the most immature thing done by a sane adult.unborn says:You clearly have no idea what assault is.Ted says:January 25, 2015 at 6:37 pmWhile I find the choice horrendous, I can’t fault the logic involved.  If abortion is truly a woman’s choice, then what business is it of ours to question the reasons behind her choice?  As I see it, there are only two possibilities*:A fetus is a meaningless bundle of tissue, without whatever makes life worthy of protection.or:A fetus is a human being.If the first is true, then what difference does it make why she had the abortion?  It was a lifeless ball of inanimate matter.  It was no more legally or morally wrong than choosing to play checkers, or choosing not to.  And if the second is true, again, why should it matter?  Aborting for ANY reason would be murder.  (health reasons may leave no alternative, but the result is still a purposefully dead child)  In either case, the reasoning behind the decision to abort is irrelevant.  The only question is whether the concept of abortion (for non-health reasons) is morally defensible.*Of course, it’s entirely possible that a fetus is both, starting as lifeless, then becoming human at some point.  In that case, no one knows when that transition occurs, leaving us again with only the above two choices.Joe Wilson says:That was disturbing and sad.scott not scared to use my real name mother fucking rodger says:I dont even have words.Ravi says:Um…not clear on how a fetus can be called a ‘boy.’ It could easily have been a trans girl, gay boy or non-binary person. It would certainly have been a feminist.Yeah I'm going to remain anonymous... says:She said, “I don’t see how she would know the gender- it’s an ultrasound, not a crystal ball” and ur rightTenny Mucho says:So, what was a wealthy person who flies first class and has a chauffeur doing going to an OWS rally?Me_Love_You_Long_Time says:Speaking truth to power, of course.Eline Piepo says:January 29, 2015 at 2:54 amQuestion for Lana (the mother): What are you going to tell your little girl, when she finds out that she’s actually only alive because mommy couldn’t stomach raising a boy? Don’t you think that’s going to produce a dent in her self-confidence, and maybe even her attitude towards feminism?calam says:January 29, 2015 at 3:08 amI am shocked and disgusted at this. YOU my dear are not a feminist, aborting your child because it’s a boy :-0.. The anger that fills me right now can not be put into words. Women like you give the rest of us who are feminists an awful name.I have a son, I adore him and he’s my world. . My husband is an amazing caring smart guy whom i hope my son takes after and we’ll do our best to help him grown into a wonder man.All I see from this is hatred of men instead of thinking you could have helped bring a wonderful man into the world you chose to KILL him. . It’s heartbreaking.I’m not against abortion for the RIGHT reasons.. Medical or rape but because it’s the wrong gender??????.Feminist you are not! And I as one am ashamed of youwhy says:Love how you delete hateful comments so much for freedom of speech.Bombe 20 says:January 29, 2015 at 4:20 pmLet me start by saying this: I totally respect and support the right of every woman to decide whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term. For any reason at all. A pregnancy has all sorts of effects on the body (and the mind) and while I find the slogan “my body, my choice” a bit too slogan-ish, I consider it basically correct.Now, I do think it is too late for an abortion once the fetus could be kept alive outside the womb, but that is a different discussion.But I have just had a look into my crystal ball and learned a few interesting about your daughter:In one to two years, she will find out that she has a sex — that she is a girl. And she will strongly defend that. She will love Arielle and Barbie and all things pink. She will want to be a princess for Halloween.Maybe you will try to push her in a different direction. You will give her a toy car. She will cuddle it, give it a name and put it to bed. Then you will give her a toy plane. She will make sure the plane becomes friends with the car and put them to bed together. You will give her toy tools. She will use the hammer as a baby bottle to feed the plane and the car. And she’ll still like pink.Sure, you will try to reason with her, argue with her, maybe shout at her. But that won’t change anything. At the most, she will learn not to talk about what she likes because it upsets mommy; in that case, you will not have liberated her, you will have broken her.Eventually she will learn what you did. That you betrayed her out of having an elder brother. An elder brother who would have loved her, cherished her, protected her. Maybe you will be able to outwardly convince her that your decision and your reasons were right. But deep inside she will despise you.And somewhere around 13 to 16 years of age she will start to rebel. On whatever the internet looks like then, she will find intelligent, thoughful and outspoken women like Erin Pizzey, Karen Staughan and the rest of the Honey Badgers. She will listen to what they have to say, see that it has merit and she will think of what you did to her brother.And she will become a vocal Men’s Human Rights Activist. You will have raised the next leader of the MHRM. Just by being who you are, doing what you do.Like making light of a horrendous crime. A man on a plane says something mean to you and you have the gall to claim you feel like you had been raped? Can you even imagine how reading such a sentence must feel to an actual victim of rape?But maybe you do. Everything that you write makes it very clear that you are harboring some kind of trauma. Maybe something really bad happened to you at some point in your life, maybe you even inherited it from your parents.But one thing is very clear: Joining a hateful ideology is not a healthy and productive way to process trauma. Therapy is.B20January 29, 2015 at 8:42 pmWhat the author is describing, frankly, is full-on, cold-blooded, willful, premeditated murder, and a hate crime against that.  Misandry doesn’t begin to cover it.  Whatever wrongs you may have suffered in your life, you had no right take it out on your child like that.  That’s flat-out inhuman.  And yes, you earned every bit of derision and disgust expressed in these comments.Duffy says:January 29, 2015 at 9:13 pm“One of the more alarming incidents happened while I was on my way to San Francisco to participate in an Occupy Wall Street rally.” “……and I demanded to move seats, I was told that there were only 2 other open seats available, both back in Economy.”*Trigger warning* – Extreme Sense of entitlement coupled with a shocking lack of self awareness.Noneya says:January 29, 2015 at 10:36 pmThere is no love that is like the love a son feels for his mother. From infancy, tiny hands clutching helplessly, embracing the loving warmth of his mother’s touch, to the childhood years of bumps and bruises and the tender healing love that only a mother provides.And you threw that all away. There are no going back. When you are lying down at night in bed, cold and alone, maybe then you’ll feel consequence. When your bed is a few degrees colder, and the spot next to you is empty and barren, where someone with absolute love and adoration could have been, nestled lovingly against you.

Under attack: An Iraqi army soldier aims his weapon during clashes with ISIS militants in Jurf al-Sakhar - 43 miles south of Baghdad - at the weekend. ISIS militants reportedly killed 1,000 such soldiers yesterday   Defence: Fierce fighting has been reported on the outskirts of Baghdad where ISIS militants are attempting to seize control of the Iraqi capital. In this image taken at the weekend, peshmerga forces are seen holding a post in the strategic Jalawla area, considered a gateway to the city   Peshmerga fighters hold a position at a post in the strategic Jalawla area near Baghdad during a battle with Islamic State militants at the weekend. The location is considered a gateway to the Iraqi capital   Location: The militants are understood to have had their advance halted by airstrikes yesterday at Ameriyat Al-Falluja yesterday - a small city about 18 miles south of Fallujah and 40 miles west of Baghdad. But the clashes did not force the bulk of the fighters - with many of them now having made their way to the Baghdad suburbsReports that ISIS militants are now just one mile from Baghdad came from the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East - an organisation supporting the work of Canon Andrew White, vicar of the city's St George's Church, the only Anglican church in Iraq.In a message posted on Facebook, the group said: 'The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad. They said it could never happen and now it almost has.

Over a 1000 Iraqi troops were killed by them yesterday, things are so bad. As I said all the military air strikes are doing nothing.

Approaching: Reports that ISIS militants are now just one mile from Baghdad came from the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East - an organisation supporting the work of Canon Andrew White    Fear: Canon Andrew White, is the vicar of Baghdad's St George's Church - the only Anglican church in Iraq. Earlier Canon White had claimed the terrorist group were six miles from the city   No protection: Canon Andrew White later updated his Facebook page questioning the ability of the Iraqi Army  FEMALE PILOT LEADS FIRST SORTIE A female fighter pilot led Britain's first combat mission against Islamic State.The woman, who has not been named, flew one of the RAF Tornados on the perilous sortie over jihadist-held territory in northern Iraq on Saturday.Stationed at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, she is believed to be a weapons systems operator.She sits in the jet's rear seat and fires the aircraft's Brimstone and Storm Shadow missiles and Paveway IV bombs.The airwoman, who serves with II (AC) Squadron, flies at exactly the same combat level as her male colleagues.A Ministry of Defence source said: 'No one makes a big fuss of having a female pilot. We have females in aircrews and ground crews and they are here because of their abilities. Everyone is just doing their jobs.'The news comes as RAF jets flew armed sorties for a second day over Iraq yesterday  but despite having now sent out jets five times, they again failed to locate any suitable targets for their weapons.Defence chiefs insisted that the flights by Tornado GR4 fighter-bombers were invaluable for gathering intelligence on the Islamist jihadists who have swept across large swathes of Iraq and Syria, carrying out massacres.But the failure to unleash any firepower has fuelled concern that Britain is failing to pull its weight in the international coalition against Islamic StateIt came as military commanders warned that Britain should brace itself to be dragged into a ground war in Iraq to crush IS, which is also known as Isis and Isil. Former top brass also warned that the air campaign would be futile unless the UK could target the terrorists in Syria.While the Ministry of Defence confirmed that the RAF's third mission had  like on Saturday  failed to locate any targets, US-led coalition aircraft targeted four makeshift oil refineries under IS control in Syria, as well as a command centre.The mobile refineries generate up to 1.2million a day for the militants.   On a mission: The RAF jets seek out their terror targets in Iraq - which they failed to find and bomb, again   Strong presence: Military leaders have said about two-thirds of the estimated 31,000 Islamic State militants were in Syria. But ISIS have held a number of towns and villages close to the Iraqi capital since earlier in the year, when government troops melted away following a lightning advance in the west of the countryMeanwhile, U.S. President Barack Obama has acknowledged that US intelligence agencies underestimated the threat posed by ISIS extremists in Syria, and overestimated the capabilities of the Iraqi army.Obama added that breaking up the terrorist cell will be a complicated battle involving both military and political action. The president spoke about the multi-national effort against ISIS in a televised interview with 60 Minutes, which aired Sunday night.Citing earlier comments by James Clapper, director of national intelligence, Mr Obama acknowledged that U.S. intelligence didn't take seriously enough what had been taking place in Syria.'Well I think, our head of the intelligence community, Jim Clapper, has acknowledged that I think they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria,' Mr Obama said.Conversely, the United States overestimated the ability of the Iraqi army to fight the militant groups, Obama said in the interview taped on Friday, days after the president made his case at the United Nations for action.   President Obama says the US intelligence agencies underestimated Islamic State activity in Syria and overestimated the Iraqi army's role to fight back against militants    Speaking to CBS's 60 Minutes, he said the militants had used the chaos of the Syrian civil war, when large swathes of the country were ungoverned, to 'reconstitute themselves'   Militants: The terrorist-group ISIS has been taking large swaths of Syria and Iraq in the recent absence of a permanent U.S. military presence in Iraq  KEY PARTNERS IN THE COALITION AGAINST THE ISLAMIC STATE  The U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group is growing, with dozens of countries among its ranks. The coalition is contributing a wide range of efforts, from carrying out airstrikes to providing military assistance and humanitarian aid.Here are some of the key partners in the coalition.UNITED STATESThe U.S., which is leading the coalition, has launched dozens of airstrikes on Islamic State targets. It also has sent military advisers, supplies and humanitarian aid to help Iraqi troops and Kurdish forces beat back the insurgents.GULF STATESSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have participated in airstrikes in Syria. A fourth, Qatar, has played what the Pentagon called a supporting role.The Emirates and Qatar also host air bases that are being used for the coalition's aerial campaign against the Islamic State group. U.S. Navy ships involved in the airstrikes are assigned to the Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet. Saudi Arabia has agreed to host training facilities for Syrian rebels on its territory.JORDANJordan has launched airstrikes against Islamic State positions, with government spokesman Mohammad al-Momani calling the move 'necessary in light of continuous attempts to infiltrate our borders.' The kingdom didn't give any specifics about its operations, but said the airstrikes aim to insure the country's security.EGYPTEgypt hasn't announced any specific participation in airstrikes, but President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi told the AP that Egypt is 'completely committed to giving support,' and will do 'whatever is required' to support the coalition.ISRAELIsrael is offering intelligence estimates and concrete intelligence to the U.S. on the Islamic State group as part of ongoing intelligence sharing between the two countries, an Israeli defense official said. But, he added, Israel wasn't asked to contribute anything beyond that. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the issue. The prime minister's office declined to comment.BRITAINBritain said that Tornado fighter bombers, supported by air-to-air refueling aircraft and signals intelligence, are operating over Iraq. Britain's media has widely reported that six warplanes are on standby in Cyprus, but defense officials have declined to offer specific numbers. Ben Goodlad from IHS Jane's has said that the Tornado jets offer the coalition enhanced capability to engage moving targets. Britain also has two weapons for long-range strikes: the Tornado's Storm Shadow cruise missile and the submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missile, he said.FRANCEFrance has carried out airstrikes in Iraq on two occasions since joining the U.S.-led coalition on Sept. 19, firing laser-guided bombs from Rafale fighter planes upon munitions and military hardware stockpiles  first near northern Mosul, then on Thursday, near Fallujah. France is conducting the operations in Iraq from a French air base in the United Arab Emirates. The base, with about 750 French service personnel and six Rafales, is 1,700 kilometers (1,050 miles) from Mosul, meaning that the planes need refueling in flight to strike in Iraq.AUSTRALIAAn Australian air force contingent, including eight F/A-18 Hornet jet fighters and two support aircraft, has arrived in the United Arab Emirates. About 600 troops  most of them air force personnel  are being deployed with the aircraft. The jets are expected to be used in airstrikes against Islamic State fighters in Iraq, although the Australian government has yet to commit to a combat role.BELGIUMSix F-16 multirole fighters and a contingent of 120 support staff, including eight pilots, to be based in Jordan. Authorized to take part in operations over Iraq for one month, subject to extension if approved by the Belgian government.DENMARKDenmark has pledged seven F-16 fighter jets  four operational planes and three reserve jets along with pilots and support staff for 12 months. The U.S. also has asked Danes to provide military trainers to Iraq to school Iraqi and Kurdish fighters battling the Islamic State group on the ground. Denmark has already contributed a transport plane with personnel to a U.S.-led humanitarian operation in northern Iraq.CANADACanada has contributed about 70 special operations soldiers to offer instruction to Kurdish forces battling Islamic State militants in northern Iraq. Early this week, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Cabinet will be considering a U.S. request to support airstrikes against Islamic State forces. This could include five to eight CF-18 fighter aircraft as well as tanker aircraft. Canada has already contributed two military cargo planes that carried weapons to Kurdish fighters.GERMANYGermany isn't participating in any airstrikes against the Islamic State group. They have sent weapons to Kurdish fighters in Irbil, and a group of Kurdish peshmerga fighters arrived in Germany to receive weapons' training here by the German army. There's also German military in Irbil to train the peshmerga fighters in Irbil.GREECEGreece is participating with humanitarian aid and by sending ammunition for Kurdish forces fighting the Islamic State group. They haven't specified any more details on quantities or type of humanitarian aid.GEORGIAGeorgia will be providing humanitarian assistance, not military aid, according to comments made by Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili on Thursday to local news websites.HUNGARYHungary has promised to send 15 types of ammunition totaling nearly 6 million units to Iraqi Kurds. Most of the ammunition, 4.1 million cartridges, was the M43 type for the AK-47 assault rifle.ROMANIAPrime Minister Victor Ponta said his country would offer 'logistic, operational and humanitarian' support to the coalition, but not troops. He provided no details of the assistance.POLANDPoland supports the coalition against the Islamic State, but is not actively engaged in combat. """

http://www.emergent.info/stainless-Apple-Watch-price	Claim: The stainless steel Apple Watch will be priced between $499 and $549 USD	true	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Gene Munster', 'Piper Jaffray']	appleinsider.com	http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/03/02/piper-jaffray-pegs-stainless-steel-apple-watch-price-at-499-edition-at-4999	2015/03/03	"By Mikey CampbellMonday, March 02, 2015, 06:55 pm PT (09:55 pm ET)Investment firm Piper Jaffray issued a report on Monday breaking down expected Apple Watch average selling prices, saying an aggregate of consumers will likely spend closer to $550 on the device, considering case and internal storage options.Building off Apple's quoted starting price of $349 , analyst Gene Munster anticipates combined Apple Watch ASPs to fall closer to $550, or $575 to $600 including additional bands.Apple Watch will come in three separate price tiers —Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition —each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices.Starting with Apple Watch Sport, the aluminum and glass version widely thought to be the least expensive model, Munster expects an ASP of $450 after factoring in configuration alternatives like case and internal storage options.The stainless steel Apple Watch model, which also features a more expensive sapphire glass cover, is expected to start at $499 to $549, again depending on customizable features. Munster sees an overall ASP at around $650 for the mid-tier Watch series.On the high end, the analyst forecasts base model Apple Watch Edition devices to start at $4,999, but classifies segment ASP closer to $7,500 after adding in straps made from precious metals.Based on current pricing for Apple's silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars.""If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,"" Munster writes.He added that if half of all Watch buyers purchase a band —assuming 8 million Watches are sold in 2015 —the accessory range would add $25 to Apple's watch category, equating to a $575 ASP. If every Watch customer purchases an extra strap, it would tack on $50, bringing ASP up to $600.The lower-cost Sport model is expected to make up 55 percent of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take another 45 percent. That leaves very little room for Apple Watch Edition, but Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year. In an interesting comparison, the firm calculates that Apple Watch Edition business could equate to about two percent of luxury watchmaker Rolex, which moves between 600,000 to 750,000 units each year.Finally, Munster expects Apple to reveal a better sense of device pricing at its March 9 event , as well as highlight ""special features"" to drum up consumer interest ahead of release.AppleInsider will be covering the ""Spring forward"" event live from San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center next week.Topics:"

http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-diagnostics-port	Claim: The Apple Watch will ship with a diagnostics port	unverified	['Apple Watch', 'Matthew Panzarino', 'TechCrunch']	techcrunch.com	http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/05/would-you-buy-a-smart-band-for-an-apple-watch/	2015/03/05	Would you shell out money for a ‘smart’ accessory band for an Apple Watch that added additional capabilities? More battery life, perhaps? The reason I ask is that the Apple Watch has a port that the company has yet to show off. It’s being used for diagnostics and direct access to the Watch operating system, but it’s feasible that could be used to connect accessories in the future. The port has a 6-dot brass contact array inside the groove for the ‘bottom’ strap connector slot. Several sources have confirmed its existence and placement to me. It is very similar to the connector for the Lightning connector in iPhones, as that connector currently only uses 6 of its 8 available pins. Apple recently began opening up the Lightning port for use by third parties. A source says that this port is currently for diagnostic purposes only — but that there is nothing preventing it from being a connection port for future accessories. Let’s get this out of the way: As far as I know, smart bands will not be a part of the first Apple Watch version. But the existence of the port is interesting. Every millimeter of the Watch has been decided with purpose in mind. In a device so small and personal, you cannot afford to keep anything extraneous. Apple including this kind of port on what I believe to be the shipping versions of the Apple Watch means that it’s absolutely necessary in order to install the OS during manufacturing. Or for testing or debugging purposes — say, in an Apple Store. But that doesn’t preclude the possibility that it could be used to connect accessories in the future. Those accessories would likely take the form of bands that expanded the capabilities of the Watch in some way. One obvious way would be to include additional sensors in a band to gather more information about the wearer in health capacities. This could be a way to add sensors that measured stress, blood pressure and more — things the current version does not track. It’s also conceivable that a company like Mophie could build a Watch band that contained an additional battery for extended life (if Apple extends band manufacturing to other companies, which seems likely). Pebble recently announced a feature for its new Time watch called “Smartstraps,” which operates on the same principle. This first wave of the Apple Watch will be about seeing what developers can get it to do with apps. But, as we’ve seen with the iPhone, accessories are a big driver of Apple retail. Having accessories that not only augment the Watch aesthetically, but also operationally, would be big business. This kind of extensibility would be a great way to get around the “I just bought a watch for a couple thousand dollars that will be obsolete next year” problem. What if people that shelled out thousands could add additional capabilities by simply upgrading their bands? This wouldn’t help if most of the money you spent was on your hardened gold link band, of course, but it could alleviate the angst over having to replace a hefty investment down the road. While the port is on watches that are being used by Apple employees currently — there is always a possibility that the Watch version that ships to consumers won’t have this port at all (the Watch’s design has changed in small ways over the months since its announcement). There is also absolutely no guarantee that the port will ever be used for anything but diagnostics. But it’s still interesting that it exists — and to think about the possibilities. If you’re curious, the other slot has “Assembled in China – Designed by Apple in California” engraved inside. Update: Apple declined to comment on rumor or speculation. Update: A report from 9to5Mac suggests, as I noted was possible, that the port won’t be on the models that ship to consumers.This report was apparently referring to a Lightning port. The diagnostic port we mentioned above is both on Apple’s watches at the event (we checked) and in their videos released on the construction process. Update: A report from 9to5Mac suggests, as I noted was possible, that the port won’t be on the models that ship to consumers.
http://www.emergent.info/matt-Taibbi--first-look	Claim: Journalist Matt Taibbi has left First Look Media	true	['First Look Media', 'Matt Taibbi']	nymag.com	http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/10/matt-taibbi-disappears-from-omidyars-first-look.html	2014/10/28	"Matt Taibbi, the star magazine writer hired earlier this year to start a satirical website for billionaire Pierre Omidyar’s First Look Media, is on a leave of absence from the company after disagreements with higher-ups inside Omidyar’s organization, a source close to First Look confirmed today. (UPDATE: Taibbi has left the company. Taibbi’s abrupt disappearance from the company’s Fifth Avenue headquarters has cast doubt on the fate of his highly anticipated digital publication, reportedly to be called Racket, which First Look executives had previously said would launch sometime this autumn. When he was hired, amid much fanfare, Taibbi’s website was meant to be the second in an envisioned fleet of titles to be published by First Look, an ambitious digital journalism company funded by Omidyar, the founder of eBay and one of the richest tech moguls in America. Like its counterpart the Intercept, launched earlier this year by Glenn Greenwald and others to pursue investigations of NSA surveillance and the intelligence world, it was a venture centered around a brand-name polemicist without much management experience. Prior to joining First Look, Taibbi made his name by gleefully skewering fat targets for Rolling Stone — most famously, he described Goldman Sachs as “a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity” — and he said at the time of his departure that he was lured away by the chance to lampoon the financial industry in the “simultaneously funny and satirical voice” associated with the legendary magazine Spy. Over the succeeding months, the mission of the publication broadened to encompass political satire as well, and it brought on a number of high-profile names from the New York digital scene, including deputy editor Alex Pareene, formerly of Salon; Laura Dawn, a digital video producer who formerly worked with Moveon.org; and Edith Zimmerman, editor of the Hairpin. “Journalists should be dark, funny, mean people,” Taibbi told New York in an interview in March. Omidyar originally conceived of First Look as a network of interlinking sites run by ""independent"" journalists, many of whom took a similarly adversarial approach to journalism. Over the last year, however, the center of gravity of the organization has shifted, as Omidyar and his Silicon Valley braintrust have exerted control over budgets and vacillated over the journalistic mission. Over the summer, Omidyar appointed a longtime confidante, John Temple â€” a former newspaper editor who previously led an Omidyar-financed civic journalism venture in Hawaii â€” to be the president for audience and products, putting him in a position above Eric Bates, the former Rolling Stone editor who was brought on as a First Look editorial director, who is close to Taibbi. The confrontational approach that made Taibbi’s name at Rolling Stone â€” and before that, as a co-founder of the gonzo Moscow expatriate magazine The eXile â€” appears to have contributed to internal trouble at First Look. Sources confirmed that Taibbi has been absent from the office for several weeks, only returning on one brief occasion to address the staff. Although those hired have been reassured that the project would continue on during the unspecified term of Taibbi’s absence, the launch date for Racket — which Taibbi indicated in September would be coming “in a month” — now appears to have been pushed off. “We have a target date but I wouldn’t make a launch date public,” said Temple, who is based in San Francisco, when reached by phone this morning. “I don’t comment about internal matters and I don’t comment on personnel matters. Taibbi’s absence is only the latest in a series of shifts inside First Look, which Omidyar founded last year, originally in response to the disclosures of NSA surveillance leaked by Edward Snowden to Greenwald and his Intercept colleague Laura Poitras. Omidyar initially committed $250 million to the project and began laying plans for a large general interest website and a number of more narrowly focused “digital magazines.” In July, the billionaire announced he was scaling back the plan for the time being, choosing instead to focus on Racket and the Intercept as prototypes for a new technological model of journalism. The Intercept has lately been publishing vigorously, breaking several major stories — federal investigators are reportedly pursuing the alleged leaker responsible for a story on the site about the government’s voluminous terrorist watch list. But Racket has been much slower to materialize, leading to rumors of staff anxiety. In August, Temple told me Taibbi’s site was experimenting with a variety of journalistic approaches — not just satire and humor but also investigative journalism. For instance, Ellen Miller, head of the campaign finance watchdog the Sunlight Foundation — a nonprofit also heavily financed by Omidyar — met with the staff over the summer to discuss how it might dig into issues of money in politics. “We’re supporting Matt in creating something unique — and it’s Matt’s,” Temple told me. Taibbi’s clashes with those at the top are likely to drive further speculation about the fate of the long-incubating project and about the journalist’s own continued involvement. Nonetheless, the site is apparently still hiring. UPDATE:Â  Omidyar announced on Tuesday night that Taibbi has left the company. I regret to announce that after several weeks of discussions, Matt Taibbi hasÂ left First Look. We wish him well. Our differences were never about editorial independence. We have neverÂ wavered from our pledge that journalistic content is for theÂ journalists to decide, period. We’re disappointed by how things have turned out.Â I was excited by Matt’s editorial vision and hoped to help him bringÂ it to fruition.Â Now weÂ turn our focus to exploring next steps for the talented team that has worked to create Matt’s publication. I remain an enthusiastic supporter of the kind of independent journalism found at The InterceptÂ and the site we were preparing to launch. As a startup, we’ll take what we’ve learned in the last several months and apply it to our efforts in the future. Above all, we remain committed to our team and to the First Look mission."

http://www.emergent.info/robot-security-guards-microsoft	Claim: Robot security guards are patrolling a Microsoft campus in Silicon Valley	false	['Microsoft', 'Robots']	extremetech.com	http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/194338-here-come-the-autonomous-robot-security-guards-what-could-possibly-go-wrong	2014/11/25	Here come the autonomous robot security guards: What could possibly go wrong?Here come the autonomous robot security guards: What could possibly go wrong?By Sebastian Anthony on November 17, 2014 at 8:58 amCommentThis site may earn affiliate commissions from the links on this page. Terms of use .Showing a rather shocking disregard for the long-term safety of human civilization, Microsoft has become one of the first companies to deploy autonomous robot security guards. Dubbed the K5, Microsoft’s Silicon Valley campus was being policed last week by five of these roughly human-sized 300-pound (136 kg) robots, each equipped with enough cameras, sensors, artificial intelligence, and alarms that they can replace most human security patrols. Fortunately, despite looking like uncomfortably like a Dalek from the Doctor Who universe, the K5 is not (yet) equipped with a ray gun or any other method for harming or detaining humans.Updated: Microsoft contacted ExtremeTech to tell us that the robots were only temporarily deployed at its Silicon Valley campus, as part of a demonstration put on by Knightscope. Microsoft PR says it isn’t “aware of any future plans” to deploy such robots.The K5 , built by the Californian company Knightscope, is billed rather euphemistically as an “autonomous data machine” that provides a “commanding but friendly physical presence.” Basically, it’s a security guard on wheels. Inside that rather large casing (it’s 5 foot tall!) there are four high-def cameras facing in each direction, another camera that can do car license plate recognition, four microphones, gentle alarms, blaring sirens, weather sensors, and WiFi connectivity so that each robot can contact HQ if there’s some kind of security breach/situation. For navigating the environment, there’s GPS and “laser scanning” ( LIDAR I guess). And of course, at the heart of each K5 is a computer running artificial intelligence software that integrates all of that data and tries to make intelligent inferences — like, should I tell HQ about that large gathering of teenagers, or should that man be climbing in through that window?K5 security robot. The lights can change color (red for trouble, orange for caution, etc.)If a K5 decides that there’s a situation, it can use one of its built-in sirens to try and diffuse things — or it can message HQ to summon a human. If you step in front of the K5, or otherwise interfere with it, it will gently warn you with some chimes — but if you don’t move, an “ear-piercing alarm” is triggered . Other than its sirens and its rather imposing design, the K5 isn’t equipped with any weapons or other tools for resolving situations. (Does anyone else think it looks like the lovechild of a Dalek and EVE from WALL-E?)A slightly odd photo of a US sheriff holding a gun to the head of a K5 robotK5 isn’t just for catching criminals, either: If you find yourself in trouble/danger, there’s also a button on the top of the robot that summons help from HQ.Read:  Microsoft wants to be part of Judgment Day, tooThe purpose of the K5, like most robots, is straightforward: To replace expensive human workers. The K5 can run for around 24 hours on a single battery charge, automatically navigates back to the charging point when it’s running low, and only takes 15-20 minutes to recharge. Obviously, in the long run, this is cheaper and more efficient than a human security guard — plus, as technology improves, the K5 will probably be more vigilant and capable of spotting smaller discrepancies than a human. In theory, because of the lower cost, you could also field lots of K5 robots, reducing the number of potential holes in security coverage.It goes without saying, though, that deploying a fleet of roughly human-sized, autonomous robots is just a little bit scary. At the very least, a 300-pound robot would cause a lot of damage if it ran into something — a car, a shop window, a child. In all likelihood, though, if these robotic security guards are popular, they’ll eventually be equipped with weapons — perhaps a taser for subduing a suspect, and a tear gas launcher for clearing groups of people. At that point, you need to be really sure that the AI is free of bugs.

http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-Edition-not-online	Claim: The gold Apple Watch Edition will not be sold online or by mail	unverified	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Grail Watch', 'Stephen Foskett']	grail-watch.com	http://grail-watch.com/2015/02/27/the-case-against-the-10000-gold-apple-watch-edition/	2015/02/27	b'My post laying out why the gold Apple Watch Edition must cost $10,000 caused quite a stir, but Ill be the first to admit that I could have it all wrong. Its entirely possible for them to put together a gold-cased Apple Watch for a much-lower price point, but Im much more interested in the reasons why: Apples manufacturing and retail empire would be seriously disrupted by a $10,000 lump of gold!Apple probably doesnt want to reconfigure their stored to resemble the Bank of England gold vaults! image CCbyND www.bankofengland.co.ukHow To Make A Gold Watch For Under $10,000In my last post, I pointed out (hyperbolically) that there are no gold watches available for less than $10,000. This isnt really true  there are a few small gold-cased watches available below that mark. But comparing these to an Apple watch is (if you pardon the pun), a case of apples and oranges: Theyre much smaller; theyre round; and theyre not Apple Watches!This last point is critical: We have no idea how the case of an Apple Watch is constructed. And, more importantly, the components, manufacturing, and sales process is entirely different from a Swiss mechanical wristwatch. My point was simply that Apples Watch Edition case looks like a big chunk of gold and thats an expensive thing, likely pushing the total cost all the way to $10,000 if my assumptions are correct.But lets say Apple didnt want to build, stock, and sell a $10,000 watch but still wanted it to be crafted from 18-karat gold. How would they do it?Our first argument against the $10k solid gold watch is commonality of design and certification. Apple has never (to my knowledge) delivered a device with different models constructed of different materials. Electronics arent like watches. They are mass-produced and must be certified for electromagnetic (RF) interference. Apple says theyll deliver Watches in aluminum, steel, and gold, but it would be much easier of all three had an identical internal design and only varied when it comes to the outer skin. (Counterpoint: Commonality inside doesnt necessarily mean cheap outside.)This would also make the final product much cheaper, since the gold case could be extremely thin and not structural. Note that nowhere does Apple use the term, solid gold case, to describe the Watch Edition. Im no lawyer, but their crafted from 18-karat gold boast could be weasel words to describe a conventional Watch wrapped in a thin gold skin.The lugs and bars (thats the watch insider term for the things that the strap attaches to) as well as the strap buckle could simply be gold plated or even gold colored. This is important because even these seemingly-small pieces would cost hundreds of dollars if they are solid 18-karat gold. Thats how expensive gold is.One big clue could be the missing gold bracelet. Its pretty glaring that the steel Apple Watch has two metal bracelets while the gold one only has leather and rubber. A gold watch bracelet has much more gold in it than the watch case itself, so the missing bracelet could be a clue that Apple is trying to keep the price in check. And the mere availability of the rubber strap which, as John Gruber notes, is the same as on the cheapest cheapie in the whole lineup could be another tell. Rubber bracelets are sometimes found on expensive dive watches, but this is no X Fathoms... (Counterpoint: They could add the gold bracelet later as an accessory.)Combine these clues and we could be looking at a much cheaper watch. Its still inconceivable to imagine prices less than $1,000, but Apple could definitely finagle a $2,000 Apple Watch Edition. Its more likely that the Edition would retail over $4,000, but this is a far cry from my earlier assertion that it would cost $10,000!Why Apple Wouldnt Want A $10,000 WatchIts entirely possible for the gold Apple Watch Edition to be way under $10,000, but a more important question is why would Apple do this. After all, those making the decisions are very familiar with the luxury watch market and the incredible prices that gold watches command at retail. Why wouldnt they want to pull a Vertu and cash in if customers are willing to buy?Lets return to the cost of gold. Although Apple has produced $10,000 products in the past and currently stocks some pretty expensive devices in the stores, a gold watch is an entirely different animal. Gold is much more fungible than anything else Apple sells, so security is a much more critical issue. Remember the smash-and-grab iPhone heists? How about that pallet of stolen iPhones? Now imagine if those thieves could melt the case down and have an untraceable $4,000 lump of gold instead of some hot electronics.The high price of gold affects every aspect of my purported solid gold Apple Watch. Where would Apple manufacture a $10,000 watch? Even that little buckle would be worth more than a months pay for a Foxconn assembly line worker. And the level of finish required to compete with Swiss watches is not yet possible at scale in China. (Counterpoint: Apple could build the solid gold Watch Edition in Texas alongside the Mac Pro.)Then theres shipment and warehousing. Although it is extremely unlikely that Apple would manufacture and ship the millions of gold Watches some analysts suggest, even more modest shipments would be immensely valuable. Securing these shipments from factory to warehouse to freight to warehouse to store will be a real challenge. Apple currently packs as many as 1.5 million iPhones into a single 747, but they couldnt ship $15 billion worth of Watch Editions this way! Every point of collection and shipping would instantly be a ripe target for criminals. (Counterpoint: Apple already deals with armored cars, security systems, and locked vaults.)Even the stores themselves would need to be reconfigured. Is Apple ready to add armed guards, armored display cases, and time-lock vaults to their stores? Certainly the smaller stores dont have space for a private room or boutique for Watch Edition buyers. (Counterpoint: We know they are working on a major redesign of the retail stores already.)And what about payment? Luxury watch buyers typically pay using wire transfers, not credit cards. Apple must prepare to process five-figure credit card transactions and accept wires. Are they ready to accept the hassle of validating buyers and payments of this size?Apple also has to worry about what a 1% product like a $10,000 Apple Watch Edition would say about the company and its buyers. As Adam Fields notes on Medium, Apple will have to abandon their historic focus on accessible luxury and fully embrace their new role as a vendor of conspicuous luxury. Already frequently criticized as a maker of status symbols, this would be a lightning rod for Apple: If the gold Watch Edition sells for $10,000, it could spike Apples broader reputation and turn away customers rather than attract them.Apple risks alienating their loyal customers with a 1% product. Could Occupy Apple become a reality? CC image by David ShankboneIt seems smart for Apple to skimp on the gold and bring the cost of the Apple Watch Edition to under $4,000. They would still have issues with production, shipping, and security but these would be reduced since they would no longer be dealing with four-figure lumps of fungible bullion.Yet even at that price the stores will need reconfiguration and the pundits will hurl jokes about the rich. If the company is going to suffer to bring out a gold Apple Watch Edition anyway, why not embrace the change and go solid gold?Thats why Im sticking to my original predictions:The starting prices will be $7,999 and $9,999The Apple Watch Edition will have a solid gold case weighing more than 5 ouncesIf sales go well, Apple will later offer a gold Edition bracelet at $9,999 as an accessoryThe Apple Watch Edition will be offered through certain high-end third-party fashion boutiques and retailersSome larger Apple Stores will add a private Edition Boutique (but not all)A whole line of expensive and exclusive Edition products will appearThe Edition line will not be available from the online store or by mailRelated Posts via TaxonomiesWhy the Gold Apple Watch Edition Must Cost $10,000A Watch Guys Review of the Apple WatchHow Good Is the Mondaine Helvetica Smart Watch?The Revolutionary Smart Watch from Apples Designers (Circa 1990)Hamilton Electric VenturaPatek Philippe 5015 Moon Phase Power Reserve: Calatrava PlusCould an Officers Watch Be the Ultimate Patek Philippe Calatrava?Patek Philippe Calatrava 5090J: The Russian WatchWhat If Your Company Gave You a Limited-Edition Gold Patek Philippe?What People Look For When They Look At WatchesYear: 2015Brand: AppleStyle: Smart watchCase: GoldCountry: USASource: Tags: Apple, Apple Watch, boutique, gold, retail, security'

The second militant was allegedly killed for dealing with the regime and throwing electronic chips to keep track of Mujahedeen.The electronic chips are understood to be a reference to electronic chips used for geo-location of targets in air strikes.There are unconfirmed reports that the men were beheaded, although Isis (also known as Islamic State) have also been known to crucify people.Charlie Winter, Programs Officer at counter-extremism think tank the Quilliam Foundation, said reports of Isis executing their own fighters are unsurprising.  He told The Independent: Isis is known for crucifying those who have tried to rebel against them. They do not flinch at killing anyone if they have committed a serious crime which goes against their interpretation of sharia, such as usury or embezzlement.Isis fighters in Kobani (2014): Civilians
