Babcock By Charles R. Babcock May 28, 1992The net worth of Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary increased significantly over the past two years to nearly $700,000, according to a financial statement the Democratic presidential candidate released yesterday.An 84 percent increase in the value of their investment portfolio and including the couples' $180,200 in retirement plans in their assets accounted for most of the change, campaign aide Betsey Wright said. Their net worth at the end of 1989 was $418,692.The statement shows the Clintons' personal wealth, though more than that of most Americans, is far less than that of his likely rivals in the presidential race, Texas businessman Ross Perot and President Bush.Perot's fortune has been estimated at more than $2 billion. Bush released a detailed financial statement recently indicating his net worth is about $3.7 million, including $1.3 million in a blind trust and the $2.2 million value of his home in Kennebunkport, Maine. Bush listed no liabilities.The Clinton statement said that as of Dec. 31, 1991, the couple had assets of $862,980 and liabilities of $165,603. The assets were listed as $158,056 in cash, $387,077 in investments, including stocks and partnerships, the $180,200 in the retirement plans, an $80,000 interest in a condominium and $57,647 in personal property.The debts were a $64,848 mortgage for half-interest in a Little Rock condominium they own with Hillary's parents and a $100,755 bank loan from the 1990 governor's race. The campaign committee will pay back the gubernatorial loan, Wright said.Two years ago, the Clintons released a net worth statement listing assets of $489,692 and a single liability, the then-$71,000 mortgage. Listed separately at the time were retirement accounts totaling about $124,000.According to federal tax returns they made public, the Clintons' total income for 1991 was $234,428, up 19 percent from 1989.politicsGet 2016 Olympics updates by emailOur best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox.post_newsletter333
https://www.snopes.com/reddit-rape-guidelines/	Does a Meme Accurately Advise Sexual Assault Victims?	mixture	['rainn', ' rape', ' rape awareness', ' rape kits', ' rape prevention', ' reddit']	https://www.reddit.com/	https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/6r36zm/these_guidelines_on_what_to_do_after_rape_or/	2017/08/02	Who the fuck would report being raped by a girl. I was raped by a female. I never reported it. I got made fun of for it, ridiculed for it, had a q-tip shoved up my urethra for it(medical test). It doesn't phase me emotionally that it happened, but when a guy is passed out on a couch and some bitch wakes him up a little drags him to a closet when he can't stand up straight and has no idea what is happening, throws him on the floor and then touches his dick until it's hard and then fucks his semi unconscious body all the while everyone at the party is completely aware of exactly what was happening and instead they just find the situation fucking hilarious. So when that guy wakes up at 4am naked covered in blood(from a nosebleed from falling down on the way to closet) with no idea what happens and calls a friend for a ride and all they do is make fun of them for fucking a fat girl then yeah, maybe that guy develops some anger issues. I was raped. Half the people that read this won't believe me. The other half will just say you shouldn't have gotten that drunk or that it's impossible to get a boner if you're unconscious. The worst part is the double standards. All the girls and guys saw me getting dragged into a closet. All of them saw her leave and me stay in there. And the only reaction was laughter and ridicule. And I don't even want to know what would have happened if I called the cops from that bum fuck college town and told them I got raped. They would have made a laughing stock at me. If I made a big deal at a university? I would have been denigrated and abused and insulted to no end. There is no avenue to report female on male rape. Had I been a girl and some guy dragged me into a closet, the people at that house would have probably murdered the guy. I'm not emotionally scarred or anything but it irritates  me when people make light of this issue. I was raped and there was nothing I could do about it after the fact. Other than get an STD test, which sucked so much.

https://www.snopes.com/trump-leaks-classified-info/	Trump Leaks Classified Info After Intelligence Briefing	false	['classified information', ' donald trump', ' national security', ' saudi arabia']	https://www.washingtonpost.com/	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/29/clinton-and-trump-will-soon-receive-classified-briefings-heres-how-that-works/	2016/07/30	"At some point, perhaps as early as next week, federal agents will sit down with Donald Trump and tell him classified information about the government and our foreign-policy efforts. For Democrats, this is a point of both anguish and political calculation. Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid has suggested that Trump's murky ties to foreign interests and general inability to not speak his mind should be reason enough for the people briefing him to simply make things up. On the Republican side, there are similar calls to ban Hillary Clinton from being briefed, including by Trump, pointing to her use of a personal email server while she served as secretary of state. And here's the thing: If he wanted to, President Obama could deny either or both of them the now-traditional briefings. The process doesn't work the way you might think. For one thing, the briefings are not legally mandated. They are a courtesy provided by the sitting president, nothing more. In an email, historian Michael Beschloss explained that the process began with President Harry Truman. In 1952, as Truman was preparing to leave the White House, he ordered that the CIA brief Dwight Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson ""so that they would campaign with greater insight and also know key national security players once elected."" (A bigger problem, he notes, for Stevenson, a governor, than Eisenhower, who'd commanded the Allied invasion of Normandy.) No president has to do it; presidents a century ago didn't. For another, the briefings are not an ongoing series of updates about everything affecting our foreign policy. They aren't as regular or as detailed as the Presidential Daily Brief, for example. It's at most a couple of in-person meetings between the candidate, a staffer and representatives of the American intelligence community. Lanhee Chen, who worked as the chief policy adviser to Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign, spoke with The Washington Post by phone on Thursday. Chen was the one staffer that attended Mitt Romney's two briefings four years ago. The former secretary of state, senator and first lady is the Democratic nominee for president. Wait 1 second to continue. ""The nominee has access to one, maybe two or three [briefings] upon request, but that's it,"" Chen said. ""Because it's not like you have a ton of time to sit there and get briefed every day anyway."" ""The briefings have to take place in SCIFs"" — sensitive compartmented information facilities — ""or secure conferencing facilities that the government has, so it's not like you can just get the briefing on the campaign bus,"" he said. ""We had two briefings: One was at the federal building in Los Angeles in September, and the second was a few weeks later at a secure facility in the Washington, D.C., metro area. That was it."" The number and content of those briefings are negotiated between the campaign and the White House. A memorandum of understanding is drafted between the two parties to formalize the agreement, but Chen notes that the process was remarkably easy and cordial — particularly given that the administration that was briefing Romney was also in the process of trying to defeat him electorally. The briefings themselves Chen described as a sort of presentation followed by a question-and-answer period. ""It is, as I understand it, the same team of briefers from the intelligence community that prepare the briefing for the candidate"" as those who do the president's daily briefing, Chen said. ""But the level of detail as well as the amount of information covered is not the same. It is meant to be a background briefing more than anything else."" The information that's presented is tailored to what the candidate would like to know; as you might expect, there are no handouts. It's worth noting that, while these are the only formal briefings, there was information shared by the federal government with the Romney campaign outside of the scope of national security. As Hurricane Sandy approached that fall, Chen said, the campaign was given emergency-response information from the Federal Emergency Management Administration and the Department of Homeland Security. Businessman Donald Trump officially became the Republican nominee at the party’s convention in Cleveland. Wait 1 second to continue. In order to participate in the briefings, Chen had to complete paperwork to grant him top-secret security clearance, which he held through the end of the campaign. Romney didn't, Chen said. ""The assumption is that a certain amount of sensitive information can be shared with the nominee because the nominee has been publicly vetted,"" Chen said. Both GOP vice-presidential nominee Rep. Paul D. Ryan and Romney had held or did hold security clearance (Romney's stemming from his time managing the 2002 Winter Olympics), but if they hadn't — like Trump — they would not have had to submit the same documentation. ""The information we received was obviously classified,"" he said, ""but I don't believe that that information was of the same scope and specificity that the president or vice president or other national security leaders get once they're actually in office."" He also indicated that the people conducting the briefing were more than capable of understanding what sorts of boundaries to information-sharing shouldn't and wouldn't be crossed. For those worried about a candidate getting access to information and then using it in the campaign, it has happened — or so Richard Nixon believed. Beschloss related a story about the 1960 election, pitting John F. Kennedy against Nixon, who was then serving as vice president to Eisenhower, known colloquially as ""Ike."" In 1960, Ike had JFK briefed by CIA Director Allen Dulles. That fall, JFK publicly called for US-backed “freedom-fighters” to invade Castro’s Cuba. Nixon was furious, presuming that Dulles had told JFK about the CIA-backed invasion then being planned (the record is unclear about what exactly Dulles told JFK about this), and that JFK had gone ahead and publicly called for something he knew the CIA was secretly planning. Nixon said in his book ""Six Crises"" that, to protect the operation’s secrecy, he felt compelled in his TV debates against JFK to denounce the idea of such an invasion, which he did — handing JFK the potent Cuba issue, so he felt. Also Nixon was angry at Dulles for not using his briefing of JFK to definitively knock down the idea of a Missile Gap — notion that USSR was soaring ahead of US in missiles — leaving JFK free to use this important issue in the campaign. Nixon felt that Dulles did so deliberately in order to cultivate JFK and get reappointed to the CIA, which he was. It left Nixon forever suspicious of the CIA and its ability to foil him politically (a refrain you can hear on the Nixon tapes when he was President). Chen doesn't figure that concerns about either of the current nominees potentially using information to their advantage (or letting something slip) will cause the Obama administration to avoid briefing a candidate or skip the briefings entirely. He notes that what is disclosed is up to the administration, and how it is disclosed is up to people briefing the candidates who are well aware of the risks of sharing information — and how to nuance what's said. But he also notes that the process of national security briefings is a small part of what makes presidential transitions smooth and conflict-free.""There is a lot of discretion, comity and professional courtesy involved in how it all works. But it did all work,"" he said. ""It sort of gave me even more faith in the nature of our democratic system,"" Chen said, ""that there could be this kind of information-sharing and civil dialogue, even in the heat of a very, very difficult campaign."" Or put another way: The briefings are a well-controlled feature to our democracy, not a bug."

This type of thing happens from time to time: A little kid finds a gun, fires it, and hurts or kills himself or someone else. These cases rarely bubble up to the national level except when someone, like a parent , ends up dead.But cases like this happen a lot more frequently than you might think. After spending a few hours sifting through news reports, I've found at least 43 instances this year of somebody being shot by a toddler 3 or younger. In 31 of those 43 cases, a toddler found a gun and shot himself or herself.In August, for instance, a 21-month-old in the St. Louis area found a loaded handgun at his grandmother's house and shot himself in the torso. His mother took him to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Earlier in the year a Michigan 3-year-old found a loaded .40-caliber handgun in a closet while his dad and brother were outside. He shot himself in the head and died before rescue workers arrived.[ This is what one year of gun deaths in America looks like ]The stories go on and on like this: Roughly once a week this year, on average, a small child has found a gun, pointed it at himself or someone else, and pulled the trigger. Boys are disproportionately likely to do this: I could find only three cases where a girl under the age of 4 wounded someone with a gun. In 13 of the 43 total incidents, a child's self-inflicted injuries were fatal. In two other cases, another person died after being shot by a toddler: a father in Alabama , and a 1-year-old in Ohio .In one instance, a 3-year-old managed to wound both of his parents with a single gunshot at an Albuquerque motel. Shootings by toddlers have happened in 24 states so far this year. Missouri has seen the most, with five separate incidents. Florida has had four. Texas, three. Due to the low number of total cases and the isolated nature of these incidents I'd caution against drawing broad conclusions from the map above. But it is worth noting that the shootings don't necessarily follow broader population trends. California, the most populous state in the nation, hasn't had any. Nobody has been shot by a toddler in New England or the Upper Midwest.These numbers are probably an undercount. There are likely instances of toddlers shooting people that result in minor injuries and no media coverage. And there are probably many more cases where a little kid inadvertently shoots a gun and doesn't hit anyone, resulting in little more than a scared kid and (hopefully) chastened parents.Notably, these numbers don't include cases where toddlers are shot, intentionally or otherwise, by older children or adults. Dozens of preschoolers are killed in acts of homicide each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . But I haven't included those figures here.[ How often do children in the U.S. unintentionally shoot and kill people? We don’t know. ]These cases are invariably referred to as ""accidents"" in media reports. But as Everytown for Gun Safety, a group that advocates for stricter gun laws, argues, many incidents like this are preventable. In a study of accidental shootings by children of all ages (not just toddlers), they estimate that ""more than two-thirds of these tragedies could be avoided if gun owners stored their guns responsibly and prevented children from accessing them.""There are policy and technical responses to preventable childhood gun deaths as well. States and localities could require guns to be locked up at home, a policy supported by 67 percent of Americans . Various types of smart gun technology, which prevent anyone other than their owners from firing a given gun, exist as well . But gun lock requirements and smart guns have been vehemently opposed by the National Rifle Association and its allies.Instead, the NRA continues to promote a response that seeks to solve gun problems with more guns , and aims to broaden the saturation of firearms in nearly every sphere of public and private life, from homes to schools to churches to bars to airports and beyond. In a country with more guns than people , it's only natural that a certain number of small children are going get their hands on an unsecured firearm, with tragic consequences.[ Guns in America: For every criminal killed in self-defense, 34 innocent people die ]Depending on where you stand on gun policy, you may feel that 13 dead toddlers in 10 months is too many. Or, you might reason that stuff happens , and that this is part of the price we must pay to protect our gun rights.I've included my tally of toddler shootings below.

(Courtesy: Brittany Mann)There was no halftime show under the Friday night lights at Mississippi’s Brandon High School — the marching band had been benched.The band was ordered off the field because the Christian hymn “How Great Thou Art” was a part of their halftime show — in violation of a federal court order.Click here to join Todd’s American Dispatch - a MUST-READ for Conservatives!  “The Rankin County School Board and District Office are very saddened students will not be able to perform their halftime show they have worked so hard on this summer,” the district wrote in a statement to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.In 2013 a student sued the district over a series of Christian meetings that had been held on school property, the newspaper reported. The district later settled the lawsuit and acknowledged they had violated the student’s First Amendment rights.  In July, U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves ruled the district had violated the agreement after a Christian minister delivered a prayer at an awards ceremony.  Judge Reeves, who was appointed to the bench by President Obama, came down hard on the school district — ordering them to pay thousands of dollars in fines. He also warned the district that future violations would cost them $10,000.“Defendants are permanently enjoined from including prayer, religious sermons or activities in any school sponsored event including but not limited to assemblies, graduations, award ceremonies, athletic events and any other school event,” the order reads.Word about the band getting benched spread across the town quicker than kudzu. I must have received emails and Facebook messages from nearly the entire state - from Desoto County to Yazoo City.   Something must be done to right this wrong, people said. A message had to be sent to the likes of Judge Reeves. Locals  gathered in coffee shops and garages to devise their plan. And what they did — would become known as the musical shot heard around the world.During halftime of Friday night’s game - a lone voice began to sing the forbidden song.“Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee,” the singer sang.Brittany Mann was there and she witnessed the entire moment of defiance. “We were just sitting there and then one by one people started to stand,” she told me. “At first, it started out as a hum but the sound got louder and louder.”She said it was a “truly incredible” moment to watch hundreds of people singing together in the stadium. “At that moment I was so proud of my town - coming together and taking a stand for something we believe in,” she said. “It breaks my heart to see where our country is going — getting farther and farther away from the Christian beliefs that our country was founded on.”  I suspect Miss Brittany wasn’t the only one who felt a sense of pride in the Magnolia State on that warm summer night.   “We may be pictured as toothless, barefoot, uneducated people around the country, but we are far from it,” nearby resident Mandy Miller told me. “I’m from Mississippi and I’m not ashamed to take a stand.”  Oh what a sight it must have been — as hundreds and hundreds of people stood together and with one voice — sent a message to Judge Reeves.“This is the kind of thing that makes me proud to be from the South,” Miss Mandy told me. “We are getting tired of being told to sit down and shut up. People are ready to fight back.”Miss Mandy is absolutely right. The time has come to stand up to the secularists.The time has come to put an end to their cultural jihad. I hope the Rankin County School Board will reconsider its decision and allow the marching band to resume performing “How Great Thou Art.”    And should Judge Reeves make good on his threat to financially punish the school district, I will personally pay the $10,000 fine. Todd Starnes is host of Fox News & Commentary.

https://www.snopes.com/judi-dench-harvey-weinstein-tattoo/	Does Judi Dench Have a Harvey Weinstein Tattoo?	false	['harvey weinstein', ' judi dench', ' judi dench tattoo']	https://www.nytimes.com/	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html	2017/10/09	An investigation by The New York Times found previously undisclosed allegations against Mr. Weinstein stretching over nearly three decades, documented through interviews with current and former employees and film industry workers, as well as legal records, emails and internal documents from the businesses he has run, Miramax and the Weinstein Company. During that time, after being confronted with allegations including sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact, Mr. Weinstein has reached at least eight settlements with women, according to two company officials speaking on the condition of anonymity. Among the recipients, The Times found, were a young assistant in New York in 1990, an actress in 1997, an assistant in London in 1998, an Italian model in 2015 and Ms. O’Connor shortly after, according to records and those familiar with the agreements. In a statement to The Times on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Weinstein said: “I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it. I am a 28 year old woman trying to make a living and a career. Harvey Weinstein is a 64 year old, world famous man and this is his company. The balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10. Lisa Bloom, a lawyer advising Mr. Weinstein, said in a statement that “he denies many of the accusations as patently false.” In comments to The Times earlier this week, Mr. Weinstein said that many claims in Ms. O’Connor’s memo were “off base” and that they had parted on good terms. He and his representatives declined to comment on any of the settlements, including providing information about who paid them. Ms. Though Ms. O’Connor had been writing only about a two-year period, her memo echoed other women’s complaints. Mr. Weinstein required her to have casting discussions with aspiring actresses after they had private appointments in his hotel room, she said, her description matching those of other former employees. The allegations piled up even as Mr. Weinstein helped define popular culture. He has collected six best-picture Oscars and turned out a number of touchstones, from the films “Sex, Lies, and Videotape,” “Pulp Fiction” and “Good Will Hunting” to the television show “Project Runway.” In public, he presents himself as a liberal lion, a champion of women and a winner of not just artistic but humanitarian awards. In 2015, the year Ms. O’Connor wrote her memo, his company distributed “The Hunting Ground,” a documentary about campus sexual assault. A longtime Democratic donor, he hosted a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton in his Manhattan home last year. He employed Malia Obama, the oldest daughter of former President Barack Obama, as an intern this year, and recently helped endow a faculty chair at Rutgers University in Gloria Steinem’s name. During the Sundance Film Festival in January, when Park City, Utah, held its version of nationwide women’s marches, Mr. Weinstein joined the parade. “From the outside, it seemed golden — the Oscars, the success, the remarkable cultural impact,” said Mark Gill, former president of Miramax Los Angeles when the company was owned by Disney. “But behind the scenes, it was a mess, and this was the biggest mess of all,” he added, referring to Mr. Weinstein’s treatment of women. Dozens of Mr. Weinstein’s former and current employees, from assistants to top executives, said they knew of inappropriate conduct while they worked for him. Only a handful said they ever confronted him. Mr. Weinstein enforced a code of silence; employees of the Weinstein Company have contracts saying they will not criticize it or its leaders in a way that could harm its “business reputation” or “any employee’s personal reputation,” a recent document shows. And most of the women accepting payouts agreed to confidentiality clauses prohibiting them from speaking about the deals or the events that led to them. Charles Harder, a lawyer representing Mr. Weinstein, said it was not unusual to enter into settlements to avoid lengthy and costly litigation. I am a professional and have tried to be professional. I am not treated that way however. I am sexualized and diminished. At Fox News, where the conservative icons Roger E. Ailes and Bill O’Reilly were accused of harassment, women have received payouts well into the millions of dollars. But most of the women involved in the Weinstein agreements collected between roughly $80,000 and $150,000, according to people familiar with the negotiations. In the wake of Ms. O’Connor’s 2015 memo, some Weinstein Company board members and executives, including Mr. Weinstein’s brother and longtime partner, Bob, 62, were alarmed about the allegations, according to several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the end, though, board members were assured there was no need to investigate. After reaching a settlement with Mr. Weinstein, Ms. O’Connor withdrew her complaint and thanked him for the career opportunity he had given her. “The parties made peace very quickly,” Ms. Bloom said. Through her lawyer, Nicole Page, Ms. O’Connor declined to be interviewed. In the memo, she explained how unnerved she was by what she witnessed or encountered while a literary scout and production executive at the company. “I am just starting out in my career, and have been and remain fearful about speaking up,” Ms. O’Connor wrote. In speaking out about her hotel episode, Ms. Ms. Nestor, a law and business school student, accepted Mr. Weinstein’s breakfast invitation at the Peninsula because she did not want to miss an opportunity, she later told colleagues. After she arrived, he offered to help her career while boasting about a series of famous actresses he claimed to have slept with, according to accounts that colleagues compiled after hearing her story and then sent on to company executives. “She said he was very persistent and focused though she kept saying no for over an hour,” one internal document said. Ms. Nestor, who declined to comment for this article, refused his bargain, the records noted. “She was disappointed that he met with her and did not seem to be interested in her résumé or skill set.” The young woman chose not to report the episode to human resources personnel, but the allegations came to management’s attention through other employees. Across the years and continents, accounts of Mr. Weinstein’s conduct share a common narrative: Women reported to a hotel for what they thought were work reasons, only to discover that Mr. Weinstein, who has been married for most of three decades, sometimes seemed to have different interests. His home base was New York, but his rolling headquarters were luxury hotels: the Peninsula Beverly Hills and the Savoy in London, the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc near the Cannes Film Festival in France and the Stein Eriksen Lodge near the Sundance Film Festival. Working for Mr. Weinstein could mean getting him out of bed in the morning and doing “turndown duty” late at night, preparing him for sleep. Like the colleague cited in Ms. O’Connor’s memo, some junior employees required to perform those tasks said they were disturbing. In interviews, eight women described varying behavior by Mr. Weinstein: appearing nearly or fully naked in front of them, requiring them to be present while he bathed or repeatedly asking for a massage or initiating one himself. The women, typically in their early or middle 20s and hoping to get a toehold in the film industry, said he could switch course quickly — meetings and clipboards one moment, intimate comments the next. One woman advised a peer to wear a parka when summoned for duty as a layer of protection against unwelcome advances. Laura Madden, a former employee who said Mr. Weinstein prodded her for massages at hotels in Dublin and London beginning in 1991, said he had a way of making anyone who objected feel like an outlier. “It was so manipulative,” she said in an interview.                 The New York Times received the following statement from Harvey Weinstein responding to allegations about his treatment of women in Hollywood. “I don’t know anything about that,” Mr. Weinstein said. Most women who told The Times that they experienced misconduct by Mr. Weinstein had never met one another. They range in age from early 20s to late 40s and live in different cities. Some said they did not report the behavior because there were no witnesses and they feared retaliation by Mr. Weinstein. Others said they felt embarrassed. But most confided in co-workers. Ms. Madden later told Karen Katz, a friend and colleague in the acquisitions department, about Mr. Weinstein’s overtures, including a time she locked herself in the bathroom of his hotel room, sobbing. “We were so young at the time,” said Ms. Katz, now a documentary filmmaker.

Others in the London office said the same. “I was pretty disturbed and angry,” said Sallie Hodges, another former employee, recalling the accounts she heard from colleagues. The human resources operation was considered weak in New York and worse in London, so some employees banded together in solidarity. “If a female executive was asked to go to a meeting solo, she and a colleague would generally double up” so as not to be alone with Mr. Weinstein, recalled Mr. Gill, the former president of Miramax Los Angeles. Many women who worked with Mr. Weinstein said they never experienced sexual harassment or knew of anyone who did, and recalled him as a boss who gave them valuable opportunities at young ages. Some described long and satisfying careers with him, praising him as a mentor and advocate. But in interviews, some of the former employees who said they had troubling experiences with Mr. Weinstein asked a common question: How could allegations repeating the same pattern — young women, a powerful male producer, even some of the same hotels — have accumulated for almost three decades? “It wasn’t a secret to the inner circle,” said Kathy DeClesis, Bob Weinstein’s assistant in the early 1990s. She supervised a young woman who left the company abruptly after an encounter with Harvey Weinstein and who later received a settlement, according to several former employees. Speaking up could have been costly. A job with Mr. Weinstein was a privileged perch at the nexus of money, fame and art, and plenty of his former assistants have risen high in Hollywood. He could be charming and generous: gift baskets, flowers, personal or career help and cash. At the Cannes Film Festival, according to several former colleagues, he sometimes handed out thousands of dollars as impromptu bonuses. Mr. Weinstein was a volcanic personality, though, given to fits of rage and personal lashings of male and female employees alike. When a female guest of his had to wait for a hotel room upgrade, he yelled that Ms. O’Connor would be better off marrying a “fat, rich Jewish” man because she was probably just good for “being a wife” and “making babies,” she wrote in her memo. (He added some expletives, she said.) His treatment of women was sometimes written off as just another form of toxicity, according to multiple former employees. In the fall of 1998, a 25-year-old London assistant named Zelda Perkins confronted Mr. Weinstein. According to former colleagues, she and several co-workers had been regularly subjected to inappropriate requests or comments in hotel rooms, and she was particularly concerned about the treatment of another woman in the office. She told Mr. Weinstein that he had to stop, according to the former colleagues, and that she would go public or initiate legal action unless he changed his behavior. Steve Hutensky, one of Miramax’s entertainment lawyers, was dispatched to London to negotiate a settlement with Ms. Perkins and her lawyer. He declined to comment for this article. Ms. Perkins, now a theater producer in London, also declined to comment for this article, saying that she could not discuss her work at Miramax or whether she had entered into any agreements. Months after the settlement, Mr. Weinstein triumphed at the Oscars, with “Life Is Beautiful” and “Shakespeare in Love” winning 10 awards. A few years later, Mr. Weinstein, who had produced a series of British-themed movies, was made a Commander of the British Empire, an honorary title just short of knighthood. For actors, a meeting with Mr. Weinstein could yield dazzling rewards: scripts, parts, award campaigns, magazine coverage, influence on lucrative endorsement deals. He knew how to blast small films to box office success, and deliver polished dramas like “The King’s Speech” and popular attractions like the “Scary Movie” franchise. But movies were also his private leverage. When Mr. Weinstein invited Ms. Judd to breakfast in Beverly Hills, she had been shooting the thriller “Kiss the Girls” all night, but the meeting seemed too important to miss. After arriving at the hotel lobby, she was surprised to learn that they would be talking in his suite; she decided to order cereal, she said, so the food would come quickly and she could leave. Mr. Weinstein soon issued invitation after invitation, she said. Could he give her a massage? When she refused, he suggested a shoulder rub. She rejected that too, she recalled. He steered her toward a closet, asking her to help pick out his clothing for the day, and then toward the bathroom. Would she watch him take a shower? she remembered him saying. “I said no, a lot of ways, a lot of times, and he always came back at me with some new ask,” Ms. Judd said. To get out of the room, she said, she quipped that if Mr. Weinstein wanted to touch her, she would first have to win an Oscar in one of his movies. She recalled feeling “panicky, trapped,” she said in the interview. Not long afterward, she related what had happened to her mother, the singer Naomi Judd, who confirmed their conversation to a Times reporter. Years later, Ashley Judd appeared in two Weinstein films without incident, she said. In 2015, she shared an account of the episode in the hotel room with “Variety” without naming the man involved. In 1997, Mr. Weinstein reached a previously undisclosed settlement with Rose McGowan, then a 23-year-old-actress, after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. The $100,000 settlement was “not to be construed as an admission” by Mr. Weinstein, but intended to “avoid litigation and buy peace,” according to the legal document, which was reviewed by The Times. Ms. McGowan had just appeared in the slasher film “Scream” and would later star in the television show “Charmed.” She declined to comment.             Got a confidential news tip?             The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Just months before Ms. O’Connor wrote her memo, a young female employee quit after complaining of being forced to arrange what she believed to be assignations for Mr. Weinstein, according to two people familiar with her departure. The woman, who asked not to be identified to protect her privacy, said a nondisclosure agreement prevented her from commenting. Soon, complaints about Mr. Weinstein’s behavior prompted the board of his company to take notice. In March 2015, Mr. Weinstein had invited Ambra Battilana, an Italian model and aspiring actress, to his TriBeCa office on a Friday evening to discuss her career. Within hours, she called the police. Ms. Battilana told them that Mr. Weinstein had grabbed her breasts after asking if they were real and put his hands up her skirt, the police report says. The claims were taken up by the New York Police Department’s Special Victims Squad and splashed across the pages of tabloids, along with reports that the woman had worked with investigators to secretly record a confession from Mr. Weinstein. The Manhattan district attorney’s office later declined to bring charges. But Mr. Weinstein made a payment to Ms. Battilana, according to people familiar with the settlement, speaking on the condition of anonymity about the confidential agreement. The public nature of the episode concerned some executives and board members of the Weinstein Company. (Harvey and Bob Weinstein together own 42 percent of the privately held business.) When several board members pressed Mr. Weinstein about it, he insisted that the woman had set him up, colleagues recalled. Ms. Battilana had testified in court proceedings against associates of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy who are accused of procuring women for alleged sex parties, and the Italian news media also reported that, years ago, Ms. Battilana accused a septuagenarian boyfriend of sexual harassment, a complaint that was apparently dismissed. Ms. Battilana did not respond to requests for comment. Her lawyer, Mauro Rufini, could not be reached for comment. After the episode, Lance Maerov, a board member, said he successfully pushed for a code of behavior for the company that included detailed language about sexual harassment. Then Ms. O’Connor’s memo hit, with page after page of detailed accusations. She was a valued employee — Mr. Weinstein described her as “fantastic,” “a great person,” “a brilliant executive” — so the complaint rattled top executives, including Bob Weinstein. When the board was notified of it by email, Mr. Maerov insisted that an outside lawyer determine whether the allegations were true, he said in an interview. But the inquiry never happened. Mr. Weinstein had reached a settlement with Ms. O’Connor, and there was no longer anything to investigate. “Because this matter has been resolved and no further action is required, I withdraw my complaint,” Ms. O’Connor wrote in an email to the head of human resources six days after sending her memo. She also wrote a letter to Mr. Weinstein thanking him for the opportunity to learn about the entertainment industry. Rachel Abrams and William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting. Grace Ashford contributed research. A version of this article appears in print on October 6, 2017, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Sexual Misconduct Claims Trail a Hollywood Mogul.

It is the main component ofplant cell walls, and the basic building block for many textiles and for paper. Cotton is the purest natural form of cellulose. In the laboratory, ashless filter paper is a source of nearly pure cellulose. Cellulose is a natural polymer, a long chain made by the linking of smaller molecules. The links in the cellulose chain are a type of sugar: ß-D-glucose. Two unlinked molecules of ß-D-glucose are pictured at right . The sugar units are linked when water is eliminated by combining the -OH group and H highlighted in gray. Linking just two of these sugars produces a disaccharide called cellobiose . Cellulose is a polysaccharide produced by linking additional sugars in exactly the same way. The length of the chain varies greatly, from a few hundred sugar units in wood pulp to over 6000 for cotton.The cellulose chain bristles with polar -OH groups. These groups form many hydrogen bonds with OH groups on adjacent chains, bundling the chains together. The chains also pack regularly in places to form hard, stable crystalline regions that give the bundledchains even more stability and strength. Cellulose is a major component of wood. Cellulose fibers in wood are bound in lignin, a complex polymer. Paper-making involves treating wood pulp with alkalisor bisulfites to disintegrate the lignin, and then pressing the pulp to matte the cellulose fibers together. Cellulose is found in large amounts in nearly all plants, and is potentially a major food source. Unfortunately, human beings lack the enzymes necessary to cleave the linkages between the sugars in cellulose. In fact, crystallite cellulose is added to some foods to reduce the caloric value. NotesGlucose is a six-carbon sugar that comes in two forms with different optical activity. The ß form, pictured above, has the hydroxide group on carbon 1 on the same face of the ring as the -CH2OH group. The  form has the same hydroxide group on the opposite face from the -CH2OH group. Sucrose, or table sugar, is the most familiar disaccaride, made by linking the sugars glucose and fructose in a different way. References and bibliographyC.

Last year, it was the slow-moving and powerful Hurricane Matthew, which made landfall on Haiti’s southern tip. It wiped out farms and livestock in the southwest and Grand’Anse and here in the northwest with its 145-mph winds and heavy rains.Now, a record-breaking Irma, en route to the Turks and Caicos and Bahamas before turning toward Florida, had blown away what little produce he and other farmers in the region had managed to grow.“This storm didn’t even leave one tree with food on it for us to eat,” said an exasperated Esperance, 41, holding a rusty machete in one hand and an overripe breadfruit in the other, not far from one of his farms. “This has taken food out of the mouths of my children.”Never miss a local story.Sign up today for a free 30 day free trial of unlimited digital access.SUBSCRIBE NOWThough Haiti was spared a direct hit from Irma and the fallout is nowhere near the magnitude of Matthew’s 546 dead and $2.8 billion in washed-out roads, collapsed bridges and destroyed crops, the frustration and fears for some in its path are no less.“We didn’t have people who died, but homes and farms were destroyed,” Esperance said. “Just because you don’t see a lot of damages, it doesn’t mean that we haven’t been left deeper in misery.”The northwest, which was already one of the poorest regions of the poverty-stricken country along with the northeast, was overlooked after Matthew, with attention focused more on the harder-hit Grand’Anse and southwest regions. Northwest farmers, left to fend for themselves, struggled to rebuild, replanting banana, avocado and yam crops to make ends meet.Then came the worst storm ever recorded in the Atlantic. Irma flooded northern villages from as far west as Môle-Saint-Nicolas to as far east as Ounaminthe on the Haiti-Dominican Republic border. In between, it ripped off roofs, damaged roads and cut off connections between major cities and farming communities.“If this hurricane had come with a lot of rain, a good amount of people here would be dead,” said Neckson Joseph, 21, a motorcycle taxi driver. “There wasn’t a lot of rain, but there was this strong wind. We had this kitchen outside, covered with aluminum. It didn’t even leave a beam standing.”Joseph was among scores of storm survivors standing near the banks of a swollen Rivière des Barres in Saint-Louis-du-Nord, a coastal village east of Port-de-Paix, the capital of the northwest. The rising river connects the northwest to the north. Seven communities in the northeast still remained flooded days after Irma’s passage.Joseph said Irma had felled banana trees, thrown breadfruit and avocados to the ground and swallowed homes along the coast. It also left the coastal villages of Anse-à-Foleur and Côte-de-Fer, and Borgne in the mountains, inundated and cut off from Saint-Louis-du-Nord and Port-de-Paix. The storm also washed out the parts of the road that leads to Jean-Rabel and Môle-Saint-Nicolas in the far west.“If you really want to see what this storm did, just go walk through the rural outskirts,” Joseph said pointing to the rural inlands on the other side of the Rivière des Barres.But much closer than that, just west of the Riviere des Barres in Trois Rivières at the entrance of Port-de-Paix, entire banana fields lay in ruin, barely matured plantains strewn on the ground.“We don’t have any farm,” Camelia Ambroz, 70, said as she and her husband, Charite Almeus, 78, tried to salvage what they could as they walked through soggy, fallen banana branches. “It took everything.”The couple, who work the land for someone else, said the crops were new, planted shortly after Matthew destroyed the last crop, and had only needed two more months to mature.Related stories from  Miami HeraldPhoto gallery: Hurricane Irma in Haiti | Sat., Sept. 9, 2017“When you’re poor and you don’t have anything,” Almeus said, “this is what allows you to live. But what can you do? It’s God’s work and you have to accept it.”Fritz Jean, an economist who was appointed as prime minister last year but forced to step down after parliament refused to ratify his governance plan for the country, said the vicious cycle of disaster upon disaster in Haiti is making Haitians poorer — and not just farmers.In the case of farmers, it is leading to “uncertainty in regard to the agricultural production cycle,” he said. “The peasant knows less and less when to sow [and] less and less land becomes available.”On Friday, when Irma’s red alert — Haiti’s highest level of threat — was finally lifted and a contingent of U.N. Brazilian peacekeepers, making the 200-mile trek from Port-au-Prince, rolled into the northwest, the non-profit group Action Against Hunger warned that a fair amount of the population living in the five regions affected by Irma will feel the impact.The damages will be extremely difficult for vulnerable, small-scaled farmers in the northwest, the group said.“These small-scale farmers have no other source of income. If they lose their primary and only source of income, they are left with nothing,” said Mathieu Nabot, Action Against Hunger’s country director. “They have no backup. That is the reason why the impact is strong in the northwest.”Nabot said that although Irma’s effects are “less dramatic and less visual” than Matthew — which left entire farms under water and coconut trees bent over in the southwest and Grand’Anse — the storm will make life even more difficult. People in the northwest, whether they’re farmers or urban dwellers, are extra vulnerable because of a lack of infrastructure, basic services and economic opportunities in the area.“Irma is coming after Matthew and Matthew has had a real impact on the ability of people to meet their basic needs in its immediate aftermath,” Nabot said. “They are not yet out of this crisis phase.”Earlier this week, Haitian Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant announced that he had formed a commission to assess Irma’s full impact. The assessment is scheduled to roll out Saturday. The government also tapped Action Against Hunger to coordinate the humanitarian response in collaboration with it and other partners.Charite Louis, an agronomist who works for Haiti’s food security unit, said he suspects at least 30,000 people will be in need of rapid assistance.“While it didn’t have the intensity they anticipated, the agriculture sector was hit and the people in that sector are most impacted,” he said. “Some are looking at a total loss... People’s economic means, already fragile, will take a huge hit.”Long before Matthew left more than 800,000 Haitians in need of emergency food assistance and the El Niño drought phenomenon plunged Haiti into its worst food insecurity crisis in 15 years , the northwest suffered from long dry spells that led to growing food insecurity and deeper poverty despite its potential for fishing and agriculture.As recently as February, the food insecurity unit classified the northwest as being in an economic and food security crisis. As a result, Nabot said, the focus has to be not just on the emergency response but on supporting farmers over the long term, to help strengthen their economic security and ability to cope with shocks.“Whatever the crisis, whatever the shock, whatever the [strength] of the hurricane, it will have an impact,” Nabot said. “If not a major or visual one like St. Maarten, it will have an impact on their economic security, that’s for sure.”

https://www.snopes.com/oregon-gun-confiscation/	Did Oregon’s Governor Sign a ‘Gun Confiscation’ Law?	mixture	['gun control', ' gun laws', ' gun rights', ' guns', ' oregon', ' silence is consent']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/uvmbp	2017/08/24	0:00 / 2:02LiveDespite this MASSIVE overreach of the state government, zero mainstream media outlets have reported on it. Not CNN, not MSNBC, and not even Fox News has covered this story in depth—it’s high time that this go viral, so that the people of America know what’s happening right under our noses.2A News , a popular second amendment rights news outlet, reports:“On Wednesday, Oregon Governor Kate Brown signed into law a democrat-sponsored gun confiscation bill, permitting Oregon judges to order guns to be confiscated under an “Extreme Risk Protection Order”, based on hearsay evidence, and before the gun owner is permitted a hearing to challenge the order.The law is based on Oregon  Senate Bill 719  and was passed by Oregon democrats despite widespread condemnation by constitutional scholars and gun rights groups. All but 4 democratic senators voted in favor of the bill, while every republican senator but one voted against the bill.The sole “token” republican voting for the bill, Sen. Brian Boquist (R-Dallas, Oregon), claimed the law would “reduce veteran suicides”, and it was under that noble-sounding purpose that Democrat legislators steamrolled the bill through the legislative process.Paul Phillips, President of Oregon Gun Owners, noted the hypocrisy and the underlying purpose of the bill. The bill, he says, will do little to prevent ‘suicides’.What it will actually do, under the guise of ‘suicide prevention’, is deprive Oregon gun owners of their legal rights under the second amendment. Gun confiscations, he says, will be “based on hearsay evidence alone, and the firearm owner is not [even] privy to a fair trial.”„advertisement - story continues belowThis is how these bloody democrats always put freedom destroying laws into place. They appeal to our feelings, and lie to us, making us think that the law will prevent some sort of damage or evil from being done—when in reality, it’s only infringing upon our rights.Many have already contacted Governor Kate Brown here , to give her a piece of their mind. We, the people of America, must STAND UP against this tyranny! Millions of men shed blood to give us the rights that we have, and we must NOT let their sacrifices go in vain.advertisement - story continues belowI am calling upon every single American man, woman, and child, to help this article go viral. Every single person in this great country should know about what’s going on right underneath our noses, at this very moment. It’s time for the people to wake up, and snap out of our complacency.

https://www.snopes.com/jared-kushner-go-saudi-arabia-doesnt-extradition-treaty-us/	Did Jared Kushner Go to Saudi Arabia Because it Doesn’t Have an Extradition Treaty With the US?	false	['jared kushner', ' mueller', ' palmer report', ' russia investigation']	https://archive.fo/	https://archive.fo/f26gK	2017/10/31	Linkedin Google Whatsapp Pinterest Reddit Stumbleupon Buffer Tumblr Pocket Line-When Robert Mueller begins slapping handcuffs on the first batch of Donald Trump’s co-conspirators tomorrow, will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner be among them? No one seems to know for sure. Suffice it to say, however, that Kushner is suddenly acting more than a bit suspiciously. In fact, Kushner just boarded a commercial jet and secretly left the country – and Trump’s White House is refusing to answer any questions about what’s going on.Kushner flew to Saudi Arabia, in what was clearly supposed to be a secret trip, as the White House refuses to say why he went there or what he did once he got there. He supposedly returned to the United States on Saturday night, according to a Politico report ( link ) – but considering the suspicious circumstances, that too could be a cover story; there’s no known proof that he actually did return to the U.S. There are scattered reports that Kushner may have had dinner with Ivanka Trump in Washington on DC on Saturday night, which we’re still working to track down.This raises a number of questions. Kushner was accompanied by a deputy national security adviser, so this doesn’t appear to have been some harebrained attempt at fleeing the country. That would have been a phenomenally stupid idea anyway. Although Saudi Arabia does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, it’s far too close of an ally to want to provide such controversial refuge. But this may have been a (perhaps mis-timed) attempt at conveniently being out of the country as Robert Mueller begins making arrests.In any case, Donald Trump’s White House’s refusal to answer any questions about Jared Kushner’s trip makes it all the more suspicious. If this were a legitimate diplomatic mission, it would be easy for the White House to provide a plausible explanation for the trip. Instead the obfuscation strongly suggests that Kushner staged the trip as some kind of bizarre response to the impending arrests.Help fund Palmer Report:Thanks for reading Palmer Report.

https://www.snopes.com/trumps-sister-donnies-acting-like-nutjob/	Did Trump’s Older Sister Say ‘Donnie’s Acting Like a Nutjob’?	false	['donald trump', ' fake news', ' maryanne trump barry', ' nova magazine', ' satire']	https://web.archive.org/	https://web.archive.org/web/20180116154621/https://www.nova-magazine.net/trumps-older-sister-worries-about-him/	2018/01/16	b'Trumps older sister is not happy about the behavior of her little brother, the President of the United States.Maryanne Trump Barry, Donald Trumps older sister and a United States Circuit Judge, told reporters over the weekend, Donnies not acting right. The 80-year-old also says she believes that President Trump might be forgetting to take his pills.I dont recognize the Donnie whos in the White House right now, added Judge Trump Barry, who friends describe as very loyal to her younger brother.Donnie was never a smart boy, no matter what he tells you. In fact, the neighborhood kids used to call him Donnie Dimwit. But recently he seems to be operating at an even lower IQ, and thats not good for the country.Asked what she thought might be behind Trumps recent mental decline, the judge answered thoughtfully: Look, its a tough job, made even tougher by the fact that Donnie is always trying to prove his value, competence, and strength. He acts like a hooligan, but its a cover-up  hes really insecure and very tender underneath that stern facade. Frankly, I always thought he was gay. Donnie used to run around in mothers dressing gowns, always wanted to take a bubble bath, and he had more talent for interior design than construction. When Daddy finished a residential building project, it was always little Donnie who insisted on choosing the drapes. My point is, I dont think the daily demands of the presidency align with his softer sensibilities...and now hes cracking under the pressure.She was also asked what she thought of her brothers performance as president one year into his term.I generally dont like it when witnesses come into my courtroom and plead the Fifth. But in this case, with that question, I am compelled to do so. Ill say simply that I wish my brother luck...and the country Godspeed.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) '
https://www.snopes.com/facebook-bernie-blackout/	Facebook ‘Bernie Blackout’?	false	['bernie sanders', ' blackout', ' facebook', ' facebook algorithms', ' media blackout', ' source planet']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/EyWHq	2016/03/30	Facebook Employee Admits To Bernie Sanders Blackout.Posted By: admin March 30, 2016This is really scary, I’m a member in a lot of different groups from cars and trucks to Bernie Sanders even Hillary or Trump groups on Facebook.  I use them all to promote Bernie, trying to change 1 mind a day.Today I was talking to a Hillary supporter within a group called “Hillary VS Bernie”.  It was a very good conversation that lasted over 2 hours with a total of 86 comments. The Hillary supporters main subject was about how Hillary “Tells The Truth”. I was trying to explain to her how Hillary lies over and over. She then turned the subject into saying “So does everyone even Bernie”After about an hour of asking her to show any REAL proof of Bernie lying she gave up and said “Look it up your self” and “I don’t have time for you”. (These statements come after 2 hours of conversation).My last comment was going to be, “Clearly you can’t post any proof nor can I because he never lies”.But when I hit enter I got this popup. I though it was just a glitch, so I refreshed the page but same thing happened??? I clicked the link and was sent to a Facebook appeal form. I filled it out saying “I have done nothing wrong” A few hours went by and I got an email titled “Your Facebook appeal PLEASE READ”It was not from abuse@facebook.com or any of the Facebook email addresses so I first thought spam, then I was like how can anyone know I’m blocked from posting anything on Facebook besides me?The email was a guy saying he works for Facebook and to contact him via Skype. This was extremely weird, but I was curious to see where this was going.I added him on Skype. He accepted me right away and said “I’m going to tell you something you may or may not believe. All I ask is you do not share my email or Skype.I replied back “Ok but why not just contact me via a fake email and Skype then?”He said “They are fake but I still feel I could be traced”I said “Fair enough, but what is this all about?”He said “I work for Facebook, and I’m reaching out to people who have been blocked on Facebook after posting keywords like #FeelTheBern” At this point I’m kinda freaking out………  How does anyone know I have been blocked from posting? They also have my personal email and know about me posting #FeelTheBern. He then began to explain to me Facebook is actively and automatically blocking millions of accounts with a algorithm that detects people who post keywords like #FeelTheBurn. I for example was banned from posting anything for 30 days due to the fact I posted #FeelTheBernHe also said Quote: “In a staff briefing everyone was told to deny any appeal that happened due to posting political opinions”(As he laughed and said these members are banned due to spamming give them time to calm down). I asked him why not go public with a widely viewed TV network or huge websites like HuffingtonPost?He said: I have emailed a few local news TV stations plus all the big well known websites and 100’s of Facebook users, yet I haven’t seen this story get viral.I told him most likely the reason huge websites or news stations won’t talk about it is because they are scared to post something without having a face to back it up with.But I understand why he is scared to come out.He can be sued for breach of contractHe will lose his good paying jobHe would never be hired after leaking company information I promised I would do my best to get this information out to the world. This is insane! I knew the corrupt corporations ran the media but I never thought it would get down to blocking people from Facebook.What can you do?Share this post on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc.Contact HuffingtonPost asking them to reply to the emails sent.Contact Woodland Hills, CA. News station ABC7 to reply to the emails sent.  We can not let this subject get swept under the rug. This is a 1000 times worse then corrupt corporations running Fox News. This is like YouTube or Google removing any blog or video that says anything good about Bernie.

I also told him that “mommy likes you just like how a girl from school likes you.I explained everything to him and got him to understand and he felt the same way as I did as he began to ask questions. He asked “so does that mean that we can kiss and hold hands like boyfriend and girlfriend?” I told him yes and even sex.Long story short, he asked me if we can have a baby and I agreed and so we did. I love him and know that he is the best man for me.so is this an awful April Fools Joke?

Rather than face the backlash and vindictive response from the Trump administration to his requests to play ball, Schumer will resign, deny all of the allegations and spend the next 7 1/2 years under investigation by Trey Gowdy.This was a great move by Trump. Not only does he get rid of a huge political opponent, he shows America that our elected officials can be compromised and forced to do as they’re told. No more of this pussyfooting around with majority votes and filibusters…either get in line of get out.

In fact, there is a reason. $500,000 of them in fact.Transparency website Glass Tabletop revealed Saturday that just before the Friday evening vote, Schumer received three separate campaign donation from Immigration for Everyone, the Council for Alien Rights, and the Southern Border Defense Fund — three groups that regularly push for complete amnesty for all illegals.Thanks to this donation and his hatred of President Trump, Schumer was more than willing to encourage his fellow Democrats to vote against keeping the government open. 90% of them listened. Only five Democrats summoned enough patriotism to vote FOR America.2018 is our chance to reaffirm that we want Donald Trump’s America — that we want freedom and democracy and rule of law. It’s time for us to not be willing to settle for a majority. We must completely take Congress from the hands of the Democrat Party.AMERICA FIRST!

They do think so. That was in situations when I had seen some stupid ones. It's an epidemic and it is created. They can't think and they can't figure out any truths. They are also so controlled by their parents.I also think alot of that control is in our schools.jay • 3 weeks agothe devices which are hurting us are the ones we hold near our bodies. I see no proof in the research I've looked at that cell towers are doing damage.https://www.google.fr/url?s...they're using doses of 30 mw/cm2. A 500 watt (legal maximum) cell tower at 100 meters from your body is dealing you .4 micro (not milli) watts. This dose is 75,000 times smaller than what they gave the rats. At 1 km, it's reduced again by a factor of 100, 7.5 million times less than what they do to these rats.your telephone when far from the tower will broadcast at 2 watts maximum (europe).If it's noisy near you, you'll be holding it right against your head, but let's say it's at 1cm from your ear and 3 cm from your brain (biologists help out there?), That means 17 mw/cm2, or nearly the dose given the rats who were clearly damaged by it.So unless you live right next to a cell tower, there's no comparison between what it does to you and what you do to yourself when you use your own cell phone.That headphone they give you with your cell phone really can save you some headaches.a 1m usb cable for a wifi device with your laptop computer will increase the distance between your gonads and the radio source from 10 cm to 1 meter. This will reduce your exposure by 99%. 1 mw will make a good connection in most rooms, but your internet supplier probably sent you a device which you can't control and is probably at least at 100 mw.All of the wifi equipment has the capability of reducing the output power, but most products won't give you access to that. If you buy something compatible with the open-source wifi projects like tomato and dd-wrt, you can take the control back from these lame vendors who deny you access to the very product they are selling you.Some wifi cards built in to laptops can be reduced, some can't. They give relative power outputs but not many give the absolute power. You can usually turn it down to where the connection works poorly and then bring it back up a bit, but it's more effective to use a network cable or at least a usb wifi and an extension cable to get it away from your body.Alex Bock • 3 weeks agoThey are unnatural frequencies big or small. They do mess up our natural circadian rhythm and alter hormonal secretions. Melatonine is basically stopped when we have EMR coming from wifi or any pulsed waved magnetic signals i.e. bluetooth . Just because they fry rats with these things doesn't mean they aren't doing damage to us. If you watch the trailer of the new documentary ""generation zapped"" you will hear how we are being radiated millions of times over from just decades ago. Do you ever look outside and see the HAARP clouds? They're basically spraying the air everyday and much of these clouds take on altered shapes. These cell phones towers are orchestrating those events. Look into 5g and how basically all the signals will share signals with each other to overlap our countries. You're grossly underestimating the power of these devices. Wifi routers are problematic enough and to equate cell phone towers as ""safe"" is lunacy.insightz • 3 weeks agoDid I just say seven and a half meters? A cell tower's actual ""security"" distance could be as little as two meters:No wonder people are getting cancer left and right or going insane.jay • 2 weeks agohave you seen any studies comparing microwaves at these low powers and a.m. radio at 50,000 watts? or fm?insightz • 3 weeks ago> A 500 watt (legal maximum) cell tower at 100 meters from your body is dealing> you .4 micro (not milli) watts. This dose is 75,000 times smaller than what they> gave the rats.As much as I would like to agree with you, the argument about the perceived safety of cell towers doesn't check out with reality. Show me someone who lives within the reach of just one cell tower. Since you referenced Europe, here it comes: the ""security distance"" to a cell tower in Germany can be as little as 7 and a half meters in the main direction:http://emf2.bundesnetzagent...If you live in a city, several of these monsters will be right over your head, sending 500 Watt each through your brain day and night. When you zoom into the above map within any major German city you will find not one but several cell towers within the 1km perimeter that you referenced. I am attaching an image from the official database of the German Ministry of networking Bundesnetzagentur for Hamburg (the main central station at Hachmannplatz 16, 20099 Hamburg).https://uploads.disquscdn.c...Even if you were to live on a boat in the middle of that lake on the map, you still couldn't get away from the compounded effect of the EMFs. They don't just magically stop their emissions at the 1km mark. You get them all.This isn't even taking account of the ""smart"" grid's ""smart"" meters with their EMFs, dozens of which will be soon installed in each house across Europe (no opt-outs allowed, as we know Europe). Nor does it account for your neighbors' wireless routers that can rob you of your sleep and sanity.It's not only about the Wattage, it's also about the FREQUENCY. Any source of EMFs is introducing damaging noise that disrupts our sensitive signalling in DNA replication, not to mention thinking. If a cell phone can catch a Bluetooth signal from another floor, how much more sensitive are our brains. Our brains run on far weaker electric signalling; any noise will disrupt that.So no, you are wrong on the exposure levels. Wishful thinking.jay • 2 weeks agoanother problem with your reasoning is that the cell towers in the city would necessarily be way under the maximum, if not, they would be tripping over their own feet. More cell towers means less max power, but perhaps more average power that you receive on your body, but it's still thousands of times less than you're getting from your own cell phone.That's why I don't have a cell phone. Do you use one?jay • 2 weeks agoYou call it wishful thinking. I call it the inverse square law. For you the inverse square law would seem to be some strange fictional beast. If you were right and I were wrong then we'd all be having houses with no electrical wires as wireless electricity would be perfected with zero power loss and what's more, with your reasoning, one wireless power supply could give full power to an infinite number of devices thus ending any energy shortages on earth with one < 100 dollar device.Tula Turan • 3 weeks agoYou OMIT to mention that this ""gender fluid""/LGBTQ brainwashing is first received in kindergarten and then in schools.

https://www.snopes.com/refugee-tb-rates-in-san-diego/	Are Refugee Tuberculosis Rates in San Diego ‘More Than 100 Times Greater’ Than the National Average?	false	['breitbart', ' el cajon', ' san diego', ' starbucks', ' tuberculosis', ' university of california-san diego']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/ILsJU	2017/08/17	SIGN UP FOR THE BREITBART EMAIL NEWSLETTERSIGN ME UPStarbucks Holds Hiring Event for Refugees in San Diego, TB Rates Among Highest in CountryAPby Michael Patrick Leahy 8 Aug 2017 47268 Aug, 20178 Aug, 2017Starbucks held a hiring event exclusively for refugees in El Cajon, California on Tuesday, part of its recently announced commitment to hire more than 10,000 refugees over the next five years.El Cajon is located in San Diego County, where more than 20,000 refugees have have been resettled by the federal government in the past nine and a half years since the beginning of Fiscal Year 2008.A 2013 study from a research team led by Dr. Timothy Rodwell , “an associate professor and physician in the Division of Global Health at UCSD [University of California at San Diego]” that “analyzed data from LTBI [latent tuberculosis infection] screening results of 4,280 refugees resettled in San Diego County between January 2010 and October 2012,” noted that “San Diego County, in California, is a leading refugee resettlement site, and it also has one of the highest rates of active TB in the country, with an incidence rate of 8.4 cases per 100 000 people in 2011.” (The incidence rate in the entire population in the United States in 2016 was 2.9 per 100,000 ).The study, which was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health, found  that, of the 4,280 refugees resettled in San Diego County during the 34 months beginning in January 2010:Nine hundred sixteen refugees (21.4%) in the study had a positive QFT-GIT result (Table 1). Of those, 823 (89.8%) had a normal chest radiograph and were diagnosed with LTBI (Figure 1). Sixty-one (6.7%) did not receive a chest radiograph; 14 (1.5%) had an abnormal result that was consistent with active TB; and 18 (2.0%) had an abnormal result that was not consistent with active TB.In other words, the incidence of active TB among the 4,280 refugees who were resettled in San Diego County between January 2010 and October 2012 was 327 per 100,000, more than 100 times greater than the incidence of active TB among the entire population of the United States in 2016.About four percent of the entire population of the United States tests positive for latent TB infection. Around 10 percent of those with LTBI will develop active TB at some point in their lives. The triggering mechanism to activate latent TB is not entirely understood, but high levels of stress, crowded living situations, poor public health practices, the presence of other diseases that lower the immune system, and behavioral conduct–such as smoking–appear to increase the chances of activation.The 21.4 percent of refugees in the San Diego County study who tested positive for latent TB infection is about five times the national average.Breitbart News contacted Starbucks to learn if their refugee hiring process will include mandatory testing for latent and active TB, but has not received a response.The Starbucks refugee hiring event will be held at the San Diego offices of the International Rescue Committee, one of the top nine voluntary agencies (VOLAGS) that are paid over $1 billion each year to resettle refugees in the United States.KGTV  reported :About 30 Starbucks managers will conduct on-the-spot interviews at the International Rescue Committee’s office located at 131 E. Main Street in El Cajon from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 8. Applicants are encouraged to visit Starbucks online career center prior to the event and bring resumes along with them. The store managers will talk to the refugee applicants about what it’s like to work for Starbucks and review qualifications for the barista position.The world’s largest coffee chain said it would focus initial efforts on markets where refugee need is greatest and there’s a store base to meet the need.According to state and federal data, San Diego fits the bill.No other California county has received more refugees during the past decade than San Diego county.In 2016, San Diego settled 3,100 refugees, along with 520 military interpreters on special immigrant visas.California, like most states, requires TB testing for health care workers . Employees of restaurants are not required by California law to be tested for TB prior to hiring.Read More Stories About:P.S.

It looks like a protest in Brazil. It’s unknown what they’re protesting, but one can take a good guess. You can see what looks like a black flag waving.At some point, one frustrated driver approaches the crowd, who descends on the car, seeming to try to push it away.The driver then backs up for a second and floors it … running over several protesters in the process. At least one of them lies motionless on the highway.We may learn more about this video soon but one thing is for sure.Things are getting out of control.Ads by Revcontent

It’s not fake news or even a stretch of the imagination that police investigate suicide as murder? Grow up or at least shut the fuck up you are part of the problemBob PapadazzioNo, it’s not that big of a stretch to think police can investigate suicide as murder… but it IS a stretch AND fake news to say that’s what’s happening here, as there is no investigation.tankritCould you please show your work on how you figured I’m part of the problem with people killing themselves by pointing out that a junk website made up the claim that police opened a murder investigation into someones death? And don’t worry, “I’m not so good at thinking” is a totally acceptable answer.Sam YoungYou are part of the problem because you want to cast aside anything that points to the satanic cults which run the world and spread evil. Just think for 5 seconds what if he was actually killed and then was set up as suicide. Then have all media shout out he killed himself before anyone can be told the truth….. I’m actually quite good at thinking. You on the other hand have a closed mind which cannot be expected to think critically. “Fake news” was a term invented so that all points of referenence in the internet however true they may be can be thrown in the junk pile and ignored. I’m sorry to say you lack the basic ability to think bigger than the small world you are spoon fedtankritI mean, I am part of the satanic cult that runs the world, but we only sacrifice babies not grown adults, geeze man.Sam YoungWhy are you reading and commenting on fake news?Clare OechsleAbsolutely agree, and I believe there may be some truth to this story, after all, how many careers would it wreck and how much money they would all lose if they were exposed? sad, sad, sad, alllll around,,,horrific,,,,KeyranStill does not mean every one that dies is fucking murdered …why don’t any of you fuck wits ask Milo the names of the people he watched molesting “very young” boys at the LA party ?He said he had been to loads of parties like that … he also said “very young” which differs from what he said was “OK” as in 12-13 year olds …ASK HIM … GO ONDMEno one says everyone who dies is murdered. you are literally the only person who said that.Sam YoungWtf are you even talking about?Daniel Richardsno one said there weren’t pedophiles dumb shit, the FAKE NEWS is the fucking retarded tin fool hat CONSPIRACY THEORY that they where murdered by the pedophiles, instead of just accepting the FACTS that these guys where DEPRESSED and KILLED THEMSELVES, take off your tin foil hat retardSam YoungThey could have been killed by illuminati you have no way to prove one way or the other. Go research more man for fucks sakeDaniel RichardsILLUMINATI, for fucks sake dude lay off the crack pipe and take off the tin foil hat.Sam YoungFor lack of a better word. I’m referring to the groups who worship satin. In this context the pedophile rings coming to light. Research for a minute you will find that 100% factual he is related to John podesta, could even be the one who molested him. I wear no hats, why are you here?concernedofessexi worship velvet, satin not so much.Sam YoungYeah, autocorrect is hilarious just like your commentDaniel Richardsgroups who worship a type of fabric? I think you mean SATAN, even then do you honestly believe there is an ALL POWERFUL pedophile protecting Satan worshiping group behind the deaths of these singers and that is more believable then the idea they where depressed and killed themselves, seriously LISTEN TO WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.Sam YoungThe Satan worshippers ARE the pefophiles. And if you’d rather believe that a successful father of 6 would up and kill binaries after buying a house then you are entitled to your opinion. But I’m not wrong just cuz you disagree. And I don’t know anything for sure but the fact is neither do you. You can’t prove me wrong and you can’t prove yourself right. A lot of questionable things surrounding these deaths.

This is irregular and it is the facts that should consume you, not the notion that you “should never take news from unofficial sources”. This lack of questioning thought is why we are surrounded by zombies and drones in the first place. Mental laziness!Christian ThomasYes, Ulanda.  And that people will take orders from “authority” without ever questioning the morality of what they have been instructed to do.  The drones are out in force on YNW today.andi naderulanda you are so spot on .well doneBob PapadazzioThis is more an issue of “you should never take news from disreputable sources that are just putting up sensationalist bullshit headlines to draw clicks”.CincinnatiChris had what, 9 broken ribs?  And trauma to the back of his head?  He suicided himself?  Now this?  Is it true that Chris and his wife had a foundation to help kids who were victims of abuse?  If so, sorry, these two close “suicides” don’t pass the smell test.Bob PapadazzioThe autopsy report, if memory serves, said he had four fractures on one side and five directly adjacent on the other side. All of these were in the anterior region… which does, in fact, typically produce multiple fractures when they’re the portion of the rib that snaps during hard compressions. It is for this reason that the broken ribs are noted under the “evidence of treatment” portion of the autopsy rather than “evidence of injury”. The autopsy report also mentions no head trauma other than the ligature furrow that developed on the back due to swelling with the ligature against it.CaliGalThe police and the coroner is covering or not telling the public the truth.Ulandaall deaths are just “DEATH INVESTIGATIONS’ until evidence can show conclusively the cause of death. Only then will it be ruled murder or suicide so you’re totally jumping the gun.  It has not yet been ruled a suicide because the investigation is not complete.  His friend just got “suicided”. Both of them “happens” to work at exposing pedophilia in a powerful industry, both their families suspect foul play, both have injuries not consistent with suicide. Now why the fuck do you want to silence people asking questions? Why are you feeling threatened by it?  There is PLENTY motive for those implicated in pedophilia to murder to protect themselves.  Now all I have to ask is why you oppose investigation of such?Ulanda’s New HusbandGet em Ulanda! Jump on their chests with both feet girl.

This is a man who struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction as well as mental illness. To ignore that in favor of motives that appeal to you emotionally is very troubling.limnWhat’s troubling is that we live in a world where whistleblowers are treated like criminals if not outright killed.  There’s probably a link to them exposing pedophiles and human trafficking , which the Clinton foundation is involved with, and their convenient deaths before exposing that dark world of pedophilia.Sam YoungI agree with you 100% it’s a strange coincidence since they were set to expose pedophile ringJames DoreLimm is right. hell there was one reporter in particular who was suicided by the government for exposing the government and military shipping in and distributing cocaine during the Iran ContratankritClearly, your wild speculation is more reliable than people with actual information. How can I subscribe to your news feed?Adam PhillipsWell looked and rich go about as far as having sex with a deaf girl when severe depression comes into play.It’s made many people do so many more “out of character” acts than drugs, alcohol, and perceived anonymity combined.How many confirmed suicides are there when those closest to the person state the person was always happy, they had no idea they were suffering, weren’t depressed, etc?Do I believe there’s pedophilia in the entertainment industry and every other facet of life? Absolutely. Do I believe that just because Chester is dead by suicide the two must be linked? No. That’s a fallacy of circumstance and composition that require a very large leap of faith vs Chester killed himself on his recently deceased best friend’s birthday because he was severely depressed and saw no other option to quell his pain.It sucks, but just admitting you have any sort of mental health issue… Especially if you’re rich and famous, is beyond taboo and frowned upon by society. Society would say, poor famous multi millionaire, you have it all but you can’t balance the chemicals in your brain correctly? What’s wrong with you… People would do anything to have 1 percent of what you do, quit bitching and make another record. So, they go on, not seeking help because they’re afraid of the stigma that comes along with it.The only one pulling the strings here, was Chester, and his tormented mind. Maybe now things are peaceful for him… Even with people searching for answers so hard they invent murder mysteries to cope with losing an icon of their’s.Sam YoungYou can’t be 100% sure he wasn’t murdered and Chester was the only one pulling strings. You don’t know for sureAdam PhillipsAnd to over simplify by saying the ONLY thing that could add up to this result is a shadow organization of diaper snipers killing them is severe tunnel vision at best… There are literally limitless possible scenarios, the pedo ring being 1 of the more unlikely.Occam’s razor. I mean for all we know, it was terrorists because Chester spoke out on the Manchester attacks, it could be Ted Nugent because Chester and Chris both spoke out against animal cruelty…See how easy it is to create a story that’s certified bullshit? All I need to do is come up with a name like lieutenant Brian Roberts, and say he thinks it was the NRA that did it. It was confirmed by sources within or close to the police. They’re looking at every angle so believe my diatribe about a psychotic big trophy hunter and his special ops murder team being the cause. I mean there’s 1 or 2 things (which I won’t spell out) that don’t add up. I’ll add a couple fancy sceiency sounding things like forensics and bullistics, and the casamir effect not being what we would expect.And without giving any info or adding anything to the discussion, I’ve created an angry mobJoseph C. StonerEven tho the sources may be reliable, you can never trust anything/anyone 100%. If it is something this serious, then the media could’ve been A: paid off, or B: said what the people with power and money wanted them to say. Honestly, we will never know in  this circumstance unless someone admits to killing him. Chester isn’t here to say whether it was a murder or suicide.Desiree GlennJoseph C. Stoner, that is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. With a story this big, if this all were true, there isn’t a person in this world rich enough to pay off all of the media. The media would make more sales from the breaking news than however much they would be paid by the unknown source.I firmly believe in conspiracies. But this is absolutely 100% FAKE NEWS!! The police force would not accept the liability of hiding a massive conspiracy like this. The media could never be paid off for a story this big. And Cornells family and Benningtons family certainly would not keep their mouths shut!! For someone to even go there while the family and the world, for that matter, is grieving and mourning the loss is just straight up FUCKED UP!! Despicable!!Sam YoungYes the pedophile ring has more than enough money to pay off all the media. They have plants in the media tho so it’s not always paying off. Don’t underestimate how much money they have. This is not fake news. There is a lot of fake news out there but this is not an example. Police force is infiltrated too. Of course the government lies. What’s more fucked up is that he may have actually been killed because he was going to expose pedophiles. They don’t want to be exposed. They have more money than you can even imagine.The Power Ranger ™“Kid, I own the police!”-Remember that line from Back to the Future 2?It’s because it’s true.The police (especially big city cops) are so easy to corrupt, own and be pay off that the power brokers on top have them in their pocket.You’re an idiot…simple as that. You’re deliberately choosing to not believe it because it makes you uncomfortable or you’re a PEDOPHILE yourself. Corey Feldman exposed the same deal.  There’s ample amount of documentaries online about about pedophiles in politics and in Hollywood as well as countless other celebrity testimonies supporting this. You, my friend, are a fool. And your a fool who’s choosing to blind yourself to the truth.Or….you’re a chicken loving homo yourself? Either way, you sound like your SICK.John QYou’re saying nobody has the money to pay off the media? Maybe you should do some research and see who owns the media? Maybe who is the richest people in the world? Maybe the people who have so much money that every dollar in your pocket is an IOU to their family. The people who are above the government. Who possibly own the government. You sir need to do some research before spouting out nonsense you have no knowledge about. Wake the sheep.Sam YoungEvery reliable source could very well be unrelieable. They could be paid off or in some other way threatened to lieJames Doremany of those reliable sources also have direct ties with the very industries they were going to expose.Goon KnightSo?

Surely not off the back of this obviously flawed article?Mark_TrailIt makes sense that this news story would be trolled by those who choose to protect pedos. It would almost be obligatory, like Bennington thought it was his obligation to expose pedos. One thing’s for sure; Bennington won’t be exposing pedos now.“Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon.” ~Saul Alinsky~Goon KnightHow is anybody here supporting pedos, you dumb cunt? Where’s this magic black book? Why didn’t Cornell give it to the proper authorities? Why didn’t Chester show it to anybody or mention it?concernedofessexthere are definitely more potent weapons than ridicule. Sarcasm, cross-bows, stupidity.

God’s speedThe TruthIt’s very likely that Chris and Chester were both murdered for wanting to expose the ring.  Those speaking out against it are either trolls paid to deflect the issues and attack those wanting to eradicate violence and evil against other human beings or are people that need to wake up.  The irrefutable proof is there and it’s a shame that the truth will come out only by inferring it as opposed to it being reported….then again, isn’t that the world we’re living in now?

https://www.snopes.com/mark-zuckerberg-resignation/	Did Mark Zuckerberg Announce His Resignation from Facebook?	false	['ecomaxx', ' facebook', ' get ink news', ' mark zuckerberg']	https://archive.is/	https://archive.is/LSajx	2017/03/14	"GIFT IDEASMark Zuckerberg Disgusted With Social Media; Set To Leave Facebook Later This Year(ET, Tuesday, March 14, 2017) - Mark Zuckerberg helped to create a whole new world when he unveiled Facebook in 2004. Barely 20 years old, the fresh faced college student knew he had something special with his technological find. But even this genius had no way to predict how Facebook would change the world.Now, just 17 years later, this 32-year-old billionaire is ready to give it all up? Why? According to those closest to the developer, Zuckerberg is disgusted with the way the public has used and abused the platform. “He wanted to create a way for people to connect; not tear them apart,” explained one colleague.Since its inception, Facebook has enjoyed a wild ride of success. With more than 1.2 billion people logging on every single day, one would think that Zuckerberg fulfilled his dream of global connection. But, according to friends and coworkers, that wasn’t at all what Zuckerberg had in mind when he and a group of friends built the concept (and the reality) of the famous site back in their Harvard dormitory.“What Mark wanted most was to bring the world together. It’s not good enough if it brings along some people and leaves others behind.” And when it comes to using the platform he created to bully or disparage others, Zuckerberg is completely disgusted. “He hates the way some users utilize the platform to bring others down or even to circulate false accounts of events or history.”While Facebook itself begins a new chapter in harnessing its platform for the betterment of society, focusing on remaking the site in order to offer global connectedness while fighting isolationism and social ills. Although a manifesto recently released by Zuckerberg himself outlines a long-term plan by his company to revamp the site and “focus on social infrastructure for the community for supporting us, for keeping us safe, for informing us, for civic engagement, and for inclusion of all,” many behind the scenes say that the Facebook founder has no intention of being a part of the changes and will announce his exit from Facebook in the coming months.Since marrying wife Priscilla Chan M.D., in 2012, Zuckerberg has discovered a new passion: for eradicating disease and living a healthier lifestyle. A pediatrician who specializes in childhood disease, Chan convinced her husband last year to fund the Chan-Zuckerberg initiative, whose main focus is health and education. The initiative has also cited a long-term goal of working towards eradicating all disease by the end of the 21st century.Zuckerberg wants to focus on helping peopleThe daughter of Chinese refugees, Chan is a big believer in Traditional Chinese Medicine and holistic health regimes. She believes that western medicine is incomplete, only striving to treat illness, rather than get to its root cause and cure it. Using a combination of traditional healthcare approaches that date back centuries, in conjunction with modern technology and understanding of disease, Chan and Zuckerberg hope to find cures for thousands of disease now plaguing our society.While working so hard to find the key to unlocking the answers to curing disease in our lifetime, Zuckerberg and Chan discovered something they hadn’t expected: the fountain of youth. While investigating several all-natural holistic remedies for curing skin cancer, Chan stumbled across a new way to care for the skin. While it may not have been the cancer answer she sought, Chan did learn that the ingredients her researchers were using did seem to push back the hands of time, making the skin look younger, smoother and healthier.Mark and wife Priscilla are embarking on a joint business ventureEnthralled by the discovery, Chan put a team of researchers on the case, seeing how much they could learn about these all-natural ingredients. It took them months, but what they ultimately invented was amazing: creams and lotions that can strip away decades of skin damage, returning the skin to a more youthful state. Those who initially used the cream reported looking 10-15 years younger in less than a month!Understanding the full implications of their discovery, Chan quickly patented the invention and talked to her husband about funding the new project. Not really interested in the attention putting their names on the product would create (after all, they wanted this product to speak for itself), the couple decided to release their new skin car line without their name or their endorsement.So what is this amazing skin care line? You can find it under the name: EcoMaxx Skin Care. Since its release earlier this year, EcoMaxx has enjoyed a surge in popularity as celebrities flock to their skin care specialists for the cream.“It doesn’t matter how old they are, this cream smooth those lines; lightens dark sports; and simply makes your look younger,” said one popular actress. “Who need plastic surgery with this cream?”With popularity soaring, EcoMaxx is now releasing two new anti-aging products called EcoMaxx Ageless Moisturizer and EcoMaxx Ageless Eye Revitalizer . Aimed at woman of all ages, this expansion to the product line is expected to be as big a hit as the original age defying lotion.CELEBRITIES LOVE ECOMAXX“Zuckerberg is a genius! He changed the world with Facebook and now he’s changing the world of skincare. Since discovering EcoMaxx I don’t use any other brands anymore, EcoMaxx is far superior to all other anti-aging creams on the market.” - Katy Perry“With a busy lifestyle I noticed signs of premature aging starting to creep onto my skin. I was meeting with Mark and casually mentioned my troubled skin when he told me was creating a skincare line. I’ve been using it for a few weeks now and my skin is already 100x better.” - Selena Gomez“I met Mark during an interview and afterwards he secretly divulged his plans to create a skincare line with Priscilla. Of course I was interested and as a result he ended up sending me a few samples right before they launched. The EcoMaxx cream is hands down the best anti-aging cream I’ve ever used.” - Oprah Winfrey“Surely you’ve all seen those memes of how much I’ve aged since I started office? Since leaving the office I finally have time to do something about it and thanks to Mark and Priscilla, I’ve found a way. I use EcoMaxx morning and night!” - Barack Obama“I had the pleasure of interviewing Prsicilla and afterwards she kindly gave me some samples of their new skincare line to try out. I hate to say it, but I am in love with these creams. Nothing else I’ve used even compares to how effective EcoMaxx is.” - Savannah GuthrieZUCKERBERG GIVES PRODUCTS AWAY FOR FREE!So, what if you aren’t rich or famous? Chan and Zuckerberg don’t care. After all, they are already worth more than $556 billion.“We aren’t in this to make a fortune,” Chan told a friend recently. “We already have amassed a fortune. I just want to help people.”That is why she is now offering readers the opportunity to experience the joys of younger looking skin for FREE!The only cost to you is a $4.95 shipping and handling fee, so you can try the EcoMaxx Ageless Moisturizer and EcoMaxx Ageless Eye Revitalizer have it delivered right to your front door.

https://www.snopes.com/man-ejaculating-boss-coffee/	Was a Man Accused of Ejaculating in His Boss’ Coffee Daily for Four Years?	false	['coffee', ' semen', ' world news daily report']	https://archive.is/	https://archive.is/NIyS6	2017/06/15	initialinitialinitialsinitial TweetNewark, New Jersey | A man was arrested on his work site this morning after it was discovered that he was ejaculating in his employer’s coffee every morning.38-year old Lewis Williams spent the last four years working as the personal assistant of Ms. Linda Moore, executive president of the DANCO engineering firm.Among his tasks as Ms. Moore’s assistant, he was to take her phone calls, set her schedule and bring her a cup of coffee to her desk every day when she arrived at work.After a dispute with his boss this morning, Mr. Williams admitted in front of a dozen coworkers, that he had ejaculated in her coffee “hundreds of time”.According to Brian Little, an intern who witnessed the entire scene, Lewis Williams showed no remorse while he confessed his crime.“He almost looked proud when he told her: ‘I’ve been eating your shit for four years, but all this time, you’ve been drinking my cum!’ He then smiled and explained everything.” The angry employee explained that he had been putting “extra cream” in Ms. Moore’s coffee,  five days a week and over many years.After his confession, his colleagues called the police and Mr. Williams was arrested on the site.A total of 910 criminal charges has been filed against him, including 860 charges of sexual assault. If found guilty on all charges, he could face up to 1070 years in prison.Newark Police Chief Barry Connell says the accused confessed more than 800 crimes, making him the most prolific sexual offender in American history.Lewis William’s motivations when he committed his crimes remain unclear, but there certainly was some animosity between him and his boss.Some of his colleagues have told reporters that he was deeply misogynic and found it humiliating to take orders from a woman all day.Some other employees, however, have suggested that Ms. Moore was often “aggressive, dominating and verbally abusive” with the accused and he may have acted as some sort of “self-defense”.

Two Navy ships launched 59 Tomahawk missiles into Syria, which destroyed roughly 20% of its operational aircraft and a Green Beans Coffee shop being used by the Russian army.Soon after the strikes, some in the Trump White House began calling for regime change in Syria. Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters that peace in Syria “could not be achieved” with Assad remaining in power.Though US military officials have struggled in recent months with a plan for removing Assad, United Airlines cleared its final hurdle for the military’s request for proposal on Monday, when it ordered police officers to forcibly remove a passenger from a flight that was overbooked.Monday’s test run was “more successful than we could have hoped,” said Charlie Hobart, a spokesman for United.United will be sending one of its aircraft to Damascus sometime next week, where it will land and carry out the plan called for in the contract.It’s not yet clear whether United employees will actually carry out the forcible removal of Assad. One source said it’s possible the company may subcontract that portion of the work requirement to the Chicago Police Department, Wells Fargo, or Comcast.Recommended For You:

https://www.snopes.com/ufo-portal-cern/	FALSE: UFO Over CERN	false	['porta', ' section 51', ' ufo', ' video', ' viral videos']	http://www.section51-ufo.com/	http://www.section51-ufo.com/2015/12/ufo-entering-interdimensional-portal-over-geneva-switzerland-dec-2015.html	2016/01/08	UFO entering Interdimensional Portal over Geneva SWITZERLAND - Dec 2015 !!!December 7 2015December 2015 - Geneva, Switzerland. US tourists filmed UFO/strange orb entering Interdimensional Portal in the sky of Geneva, just over CERN area.The CERN project site is located in Geneva, Switzerland. The CERN functions as a Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the World. A collider is the basic tool of particle physics. You take a stream of particles, accelerate them to really high kinetic energy levels, and initiate a collision to slam them into a target. Depending intensity of the experiment, all sorts of peculiar things can happen.As of in 2015, CERN reached levels of double potency over the 10 Tev barrier of dark matter – the theoretical minimal energy of formation of a ‘bag of strangelets’ and ‘micro-black holes’.More people have become more aware of the CERN project aggressive ambitions to explore the unknown ‘dark universe” many have pointed to signs that have people troubled if not terrified by the parade of symbolism used at the CERN facility itself. At CERN headquarters a symbol of Shiva, the (Hindu God of Destruction) dancing the cosmic dance of death and destruction can be clearly seen at the CERN facility. Is this a Symbolic declaration of CERN’s ultimate intention to bring on a new age of destruction to this planet?“The men who would play God, in searching for the God particle, are truly going to find more than they bargained for as they open the gates of hell” Stephen Quayle warns, “they will find inter-dimensional beings who have a taste for human flesh and humanities destruction. Most scientists, in lacking an understanding of the ‘supernatural entities’ that are going to confront them, are way beyond their ability to comprehend, let alone control, the forces of Pandora’s box that will be released.”Yet, on September 23, 2015, the 70th year of Jubilee, at beginning of the Fall equinox, and after the passage of 70 generations since the great flood that enveloped the whole planet CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) research facility will initiate a monumental step into the unknown.A massive portal constructed by leading world scientists will be prepared to cause a much more intense particle collision that will rival the moment of the “big bang.” As a result a possible gateway for “dark matter” or alternate inter-dimensions can be perhaps initiated by CERN’s intense particle collision capability. This activity may indeed usher in a new age for all humanity and even this planet.Therefore, despite concerns and warnings from other leading science and theological experts a transcending portal will be left wide open and we have no way of knowing what will come forth from this massive particle collision induced gateway. In regards to the acknowledged revitalization of the CERN project mission to open an inter-dimensional portal many have become concerned, some fearful, others filled with curious intrigue over this date of September 23, 2015. However, only time will tell the significant impact 9/23 will have on humanity or on this planet.Therefore, As Sergio Bertolucci clearly stated publicly CERN is meant to open a gateway for “dark matter” and usher in the possibility of beings from alternate dimensions to emerge from it. These recent revelations about the CERN developments prove to us the scientific community is no longer able to explain ‘reality’ without looking at the ‘supernatural’.Hence, with this pronouncement of CERN’s pending capability to serve as a portal or doorway for “dark matter” humanity must buckle their seat belts for the new age to come by this imposing dabble with darkness.“For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man” (Matt. 24: 37)Moreover, serious scientists regularly discuss the possibility of other dimensions and “wormholes” in books and on scientific documentaries for TV. In the bestselling book Hyperspace Michio Kaku refers to Flight 19 and the Bermuda Triangle :“Ever since Flight 19, a group of U.S. military torpedo bombers, vanished in the Caribbean 30 years ago, mystery writers too have used higher dimensions as a convenient solution to the puzzle of the Bermuda Triangle, or Devil’s Triangle. Some have conjectured that airplanes and ships disappearing in the Bermuda Triangle actually entered some sort of passageway to another world.”Could UFOS use interdimensional portals opening up above earth ?Watch the VIDEO HERE !Subscribe to Section 51 !

For years we have received complaints from concerned parents saying that they didn’t want their children to be subjected to tattoos so this decision has been a longtime coming. We still value tattooed customers, we just want them to cover up before experiencing the Happiest Place on Earth.”Reactions on social media have, as one would expect, been very strong.“I used to bring my family to Disney every year!” Travis Barker tweeted this morning. “Now we will never go there again!!!! #knottsberryfarm4lyfe”Legally, Disney has the right to refuse entry to anyone they please because the parks are their private property. “While we respect individuals’ freedom of expression through tattoos, we do not think that ink has any place in the Magic Kingdom,” Engañar told Inked. “For those who didn’t bring long sleeves or have neck tattoos we opened gift shops in front of our gates so that they can buy a Disney sweatshirt or scarf to cover their tattoos up before entering our theme parks.”For years it has been rumored that Disney CEO Bob Iger has despised tattoos, not just for the aesthetic quality, but because of tattoo artists making money for inking Disney logos and characters without compensating his corporation.“Ownership of trademarks in this country means that nobody can profit off of your intellectual property,” he wrote in an internal memo that was leaked to Breitbart.com in 2014. “But I have seen thousands of Disney tattoos on patrons of our theme parks and I haven’t seen one dime coming from any of those tattoos. It is like we are being mocked in our own house.”Other than tattoos, Disney has also banned facial piercings other than earrings and nose studs. That means no lip, eyebrow, septum or dimple piercings. We asked Engañar if nose rings and ear plugs/tunnels were allowed but she didn’t understand what those were, so she said she wanted to “look into it.”Last year, Disney banned selfie sticks and hoverboards, but this is the first time the parks have restricted any form of body art or permanent cosmetics. We at Inked applauded Walt Disney World and Resort for backing the Florida Competitive Workforce Act which pushed for LGBT rights in the workplace but we strongly believe that the banning of visible tattoos is a severe discriminatory practice.Sadly, the parks are also removing seven of the pirates from their popular Pirates of the Caribbean ride because they have tattoos. “This is a zero tolerance policy beginning today, April 1st,” Engañar said. “Not even Johnny Depp will be allowed into our parks with short sleeves.”Available at INKEDSHOP.COM : Women’s Inked Logo V-Neck T-ShirtAnnounced today, Disney theme parks, including Walt Disney World Florida and Disneyland in Anaheim, are banning admittance to anyone with visible tattoos.

My name is Dwayne Johnson. Many of you may know me better as The Rock.I am running for the President of the United States.I know that this may sound like a joke to many of you. But it’s not. I am throwing my hat in the ring for 2020. I am not running against Donald Trump. I am not running against whatever candidate the Democrats field. I am not running against anyone. I am running for the country. As an independent. I am running on a simple platform of compassion and civility.You may ask why someone who has never publicly expressed a political opinion is running for office, and I will tell you that is exactly why I am running for the Presidency. I do not owe any obligation to either party, so I do not need to feel beholden to either of their platforms or their ideologies. Mine, again, is a simple platform based on civility and compassion. It is based on a desire to lift everyone up — rich, poor, young, old, black, white, American born or foreign born, gay, straight or transgender — to bring us together again, to make this country whole.The fact that I have expressed so few political opinions I hope will help me in this effort because it is my hope not to advocate for the extreme positions of either party, but to find a middle ground between them both. It used to be possible to find some common ground, for each side to listen to each other, negotiate, and find a place in the middle that leaves everyone happy enough. I am running for the 70 percent of this country who wants to get along, who is willing to give a little to get a little. Who is nostalgic for dinnertime conversations that revolve around workdays or school, dance recitals, little league games, movies, TV shows, worship services, and celebrity gossip, instead of eating dinner fraught with anxiety about what’s going on in the news.I am someone who has worked successfully with people from both sides of the political spectrum and who, I believe, has gained the respect of people from all political stripes. I’ve been a popular college football player. I’ve been a popular professional wrestler, and I have been a popular actor, but I have also been careful never to let my ego get in the way. I have had a lot of box office hits, and I have had a lot of box office bombs, but I have never been defined by ratings, by the number of people who go see my movies, or by the crowds that came out to see me during my football and wrestling careers. I am the same, big-hearted, caring person every day, whether Hercules makes $10 million at the box office, or whether Fast & Furious 10 makes $100 million.There is one position where I will not bend, however, and that’s where it concerns compassion for everyone, from immigrants to low-income white people to the people of color in our cities, in our suburbs, and in rural America, to the people from abroad escaping poverty, famine, or brutal dictators. We live in a huge country, and there is plenty of space for everyone, and plenty of money and resources to go around, even if that means taking a little more from the extremely well off to help out the extremely unfortunate.As Commander in Chief, I will refashion foreign policy to align with my own personality: I will use my strength and might of our military to serve the big heart of the American public. It’s important that we stand up for the little guy, but that in doing so, never become bullies ourselves. Bullying and bluster is the surest sign of insecurity and weakness, and it is not who we are. It sure as hell isn’t who I am. We have to be better than that.Some of you may be wondering why I’ve announced my intention to run for the President of the United States only 12 days into the existing administration. There’s two reasons, actually. First of all, President Trump signed papers to begin his run for 2020 on Inauguration Day, so I am already 12 days behind!More importantly, however, is my hope to use my popularity, my broad demographic appeal, and my name recognition to shift focus away from the ugly partisanship going on in D.C. right now and onto the themes on which I plan to run. I intend to hit the campaign trail immediately, and it is my hope that whatever cultural capital I have accrued over the years fighting Hulk Hogan or Vin Diesel is enough to attract both crowds and the media. It is also my hope that those crowds and the media might begin to absorb some of the lessons about compassion and civility that I plan to impart and apply them long before our next election rolls around.I won’t run a negative campaign, because I don’t need to. I’m Dwayne Johnson. I will never begin a sentence with, “But my opponent …” I don’t need to tear anyone down in order to make myself look bigger.God has also blessed me with a smile that has a calming effect on those around me, and I hope to put it good use over the next four years as I tour this country in an effort to bring us all back together. I want to rebuild us around a very simple idea that that a difference of opinion does not have to separate us, that within most of us, there is goodness, that we can put that goodness to use, and that we are a better country when we are united than when we let our leaders divide us.I’m not asking for your vote now. I’m just asking you to listen. Give me four years to let me convince you that I deserve your vote before you make a decision. I’ll probably regret a few of the things I saw along the way, and in a campaign this long, there will probably be a backlash, and then a backlash to the backlash, but for the first three years, anyway, I’m not here to win your vote. I’m here to offer you hope, to remind you that there’s an alternative to this current political climate waiting in the wings.  I hope that I can offer you all a light at the end of the tunnel.I am Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, and I hope to be your next President of the United States. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless this country we love.Get entertainment, celebrity and politics updates via Facebook or Twitter .

Most PopularByRheanna O\'Neil BellomoJan 4, 2017 If you\'ve ever been on a bad date and needed an ""emergency"" excuse to walk out the door, then you\'ll be even more relieved by a new, helpful trend sweeping bars across the globe. Not only are waitstaff helping women flee a bad date, they want to help keep you out of harm\'s way.At Iberian Restaurant in St. Petersburg, FL, this means there is a discreet sign in the women\'s restroom that reads ""Is your Tinder date not who they said they were on their profile? Do you feel unsafe or even just a tad bit weird?"" If so, the sign advises, order an ""angel shot.""Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowWait, what is this mysterious drink? Well it\'s actually not booze at all. It\'s a code that will discreetly tell the bartender you need help, the Tampa Bay Times reports.Here\'s how it works: Order an angel shot neat and a bartender will escort you to your car. Ask for it with ice and the bartender will call a taxi or Uber for you. Order it with lime and the restaurant staff will call the police.Apparently this code word was inspired by a similar movement in London, where women are ""asking for Angela"" to signal an unsafe situation during a date.

As a former army officer, a father and business leader, I’ve heard the arguments from all sides. And, as CEO of a 163-year-old company whose products and presence rest at the intersection of culture and community in more than 110 countries around the world, I feel a tremendous responsibility to share our position on the issue, now, at a time when clarity is paramount. Providing a safe environment to work and shop is a top priority for us at Levi Strauss & Co. That imperative is quickly challenged, however, when a weapon is carried into one of our stores. Recently, we had an incident in one of our stores where a gun inadvertently went off, injuring the customer who was carrying it.So, while we understand the heartfelt and strongly-held opinions on both sides of the gun debate, it is with the safety and security of our employees and customers in mind that we respectfully ask people not to bring firearms into our stores, offices or facilities, even in states where it’s permitted by law. Of course, authorized members of law enforcement are an exception.With stores in Paris, Nice and Orlando, and the company’s European headquarters in Brussels, I’ve thought more about safety in the past year than in the previous three decades of my career because of how ‘close to home’ so many incidents with guns have come to impacting people working for this company.We operate in hundreds of stores across every state in the U.S., and laws are different in each one. We know that the presence of firearms in our stores creates an unsettling environment for many of our employees and customers. We also know that trying to enforce a ban could potentially undermine the purpose of the ban itself: safety. With that in mind we’ve made this decision as a business – a request not a mandate – and we sincerely hope responsible gun owners will respect our position. It boils down to this: you shouldn’t have to be concerned about your safety while shopping for clothes or trying on a pair of jeans. Simply put, firearms don't belong in either of those settings. In the end, I believe we have an obligation to our employees and customers to ensure a safe environment and keeping firearms out of our stores and offices will get us one step closer to achieving that reality.  Sincerely,President and Chief Executive Officer, Levi Strauss & Co.FollowFollowingUnfollowChip Bergh

He incorrectly reported that the National Guard Armory was our school with bars on the windows and a cannon out front. He outed my gay uncle on CNN and even posted a pic of the store he owns and called him pot belly because he's is overweight. Several inconsistencies. He even snarked about our national forest.

However, the most powerful benefit to come out of this common weed is something that medical researchers are super excited to have ""discovered"" - which is its potential to cure cancer!proverbsthirtyonewoman.blogspot.comThis potent root builds up blood and immune system- cures prostate, lung, and other cancers better than chemotherapy. According to Dr. Carolyn Hamm from the Windsor Regional Cancer Centre in Ontario, Canada, dandelion root extract was the only thing that helped with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. This form of cancer typically affects older adults.John Di Carlo, who at the time was a 72-year old cancer patient at the hospital, was sent home to live out his final days after all efforts failed to treat his leukemia. He told CBC News that he was advised to drink dandelion root tea as a last ditch effort. Perhaps it should have been the first option offered in his treatment plan, as his cancer went into remission only four months later! His doctors attributed this to the dandelion tea that he drank.Screenshot via YouTubeRecent studies have shown that dandelion root extract can work very quickly on cancer cells, as was evidenced in Di Carlo's case. Within 48 hours of coming into contact with the extract, cancerous cells begin to disintegrate. The body happily replaces these with healthy new cells.Further studies have concluded that the extract also has anti-cancer benefits for other types of cancer, including breast, colon, prostate, liver, and lung cancer! Dandelion root tea may not taste as pleasant as other teas, but it's certainly more pleasant than living with the side effects of chemotherapy or radiation treatments.Traditional cancer therapies harm the immune system by killing all cells, even the healthy ones. Dandelion root has the opposite effect - it actually helps boost your immune system and only targets the unhealthy cells. It's definitely a win-win situation!Dr. Hamm warns, however, that dandelion root extract can negatively impact the effects of chemotherapy. It's always best to consult with your doctor, and let them know any and all supplements or foods that you are consuming on a regular basis.Screenshot via YouTubeEven if you don't have cancer, eating the greens or drinking dandelion tea can still give you great health! For example, the roots and stems of dandelion can help fight diabetes. It does this by stimulating the pancreas to produce insulin, which in turn stabilizes the spikes in blood sugar levels.If you suffer from digestive issues or need to get rid of toxins, dandelion tea may be just what the herbal medicine doctor ordered! The liver aids the digestive system by producing bile, and it also filters the blood of chemicals and other impurities. According to Dr. Axe , the vitamins and minerals found in dandelions can help cleanse the liver and keep it in tip top shape. So by supporting your liver, you are actually creating better health!Screenshot via YouTubeDandelions are also high in antioxidants and vitamin C, which is crucial to helping your body fight off infections, such as the bacteria that cause urinary tract infections. If you suffer from frequent bouts of UTI, drinking dandelion tea on a daily basis may prevent it from happening ever again.Dandelion greens are bitter, but completely edible - as long as you get it from an area that hasn't been sprayed with chemicals. The greens are rich in fiber, which is great for intestinal health! High fiber diets have also been shown to reduce the risk of obesity, heart disease, and irritable bowel syndrome.The greens are also high in vitamin A - just one cup contains 100% of your recommended daily allowance. Vitamin A is critical for maintaining healthy vision, and it can also prevent premature aging of the skin.Since you probably aren't likely to eat an entire cup of bitter greens on its own, you can incorporate it into a morning smoothie. Just blend it up with your favorite fruit, which will offset the bitter taste.Screenshot via YouTubeSponsoredSECURITY WARNING: Please treat the URL above as you would your password and do not share it with anyone.

What was that vaccine? Well according to Henry Rothschild, (no relation to the Rothschild family allegedly) the vaccine is known as Terminar.Terminar which is Spanish for terminate, according to Mr. Rothschild Terminar was design to break down African American/Black women ovaries exposing them to different germs and multiple diseases which will likely produce a child with serious birth defects and serious illnesses.The government ran a secret operation releasing the anesthetic to predominately black areas. They figure it was best to distribute it through an Epidural so it will go unnoticed. Mr. Rothschild child is asking both black and white women to find out what illnesses may run in your family. If you received an Epidural between 2010-2014 and later gave birth anywhere from 2011 until present, if your child was born with any illness that's not normal this may be the reason why.Fammtv.com Up To The Second NewsLike34K
https://www.snopes.com/queen-elizabeth-remove-obamas-guest-list/	Did Queen Elizabeth Remove the Obamas from Royal Wedding Guest List?	false	['barack obama', ' fake news', ' just news usa', ' michelle obama', ' queen elizabeth', ' royal wedding', ' your news wire', ' yournewswire.com']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/1cJLE	2017/12/06	Queen Just Gave Michelle Royal Beatdown After She Tried To Sneak A Spot On Wedding Guest ListPosted on Author Jordan Hill  Comment(0)For eight years, Michelle Obama genuinely thought she was a queen and expected to be treated like one. Now that she’s a regular citizen, she’s having a hard time of letting go of her former status as the (failed) first lady and keeps trying to push her way into every major social scene where she doesn’t belong and is apparently not invited.When she heard the news that Prince Harry was marrying a black American girl, she assumed it was her place to be on that guest list, which has to be approved by the Queen of England herself. Michelle made a desperation move to sneak a spot on that exclusive guest list and as soon as the real queen found out what the wannabe royalty did, she delivered a brutal beatdown that was definitely deserved.As soon as the big news about the royal engagement of Prince Harry and an American actress Meghan Markle was announced, the Obamas saw an opportunity to edge their way into the elites, like a couple of desperate kids trying to hang with the popular crowd at school. Barack immediately got on social media to beat President Trump to the congratulatory punch. He has a lot more time on his hands than the Commander-in-Chief who is busy cleaning up his mess.Barack practically stalked the prince on Twitter and made a post within seconds of the news coming out, which perhaps had an undertone of letting the royals know that he and Michelle were available that day to attend.The Obamas know what they are doing when it comes to getting attention on themselves and this post was no exception. It garnered a whopping 1 million “likes” on it which both he and Michelle were likely elated about since the royal family was likely sure to see it.The exposure of this post sparked rumors that the Obamas would likely be added to the guest list in the current president and first lady’s place, the Independent reported. While Barack was making desperate tweets to secretly get on the guestlist, Michelle was doing something worse to shove the Trumps aside and ensure her spot, even though the honor is typically reserved for the current president and first lady.Michelle has been making the speaking engagement rounds lately to rack in hundreds of thousands of dollars to trash Trump. Her recent trip to Canada was no exception as she combined it with a hidden mission of getting to the royal wedding.The former first lady had been invited as the keynote speaker in addressing the “Economic Club of Toronto,” when she deviated from her planned remarks to double down on her and Barack’s desperate attempt to kiss up to the Queen of England.According to Page Six, Michelle took the opportunity to make fun of President Trump then immediately gushed over the queen. Both conversation deviations had no place in an event like this, but for calculated Michelle, it has a passive-aggressive purpose of saying that Trump wasn’t fit for her guest list, but since she loves the queen so much, she should get a spot.“After being introduced by Canada’s first lady, Sophie Trudeau, Obama told the crowd that it is ‘never a good idea’ to put your first thought in the morning on social media, and never a good idea to ‘tweet from bed,’ which appears to be one of the president’s favorite pastimes, presuming that he is actually in bed when he tweets at 3 a.m,” Page Six reported.“Going on about effective communication, and the importance of doing drafts, Obama went on, ‘Then you need to edit and spell-check it.’ The 45-minute conversation, hosted by the Economic Club of Toronto, flowed into a bunch of amusing side stories, including her memories of being awestruck when meeting Queen Elizabeth of England.”“’What do you do with the queen? I touched her. She touched me first,’ she said, adding that her dream dinner guest would be Jesus, whom she’d serve pizza.”It’s well known that the respect, proper etiquette, and holding a high-level of decorum is important to the royal family and by painting a picture that Trump can’t control himself, Michelle thought she was making him look like a bad person to have at the wedding.However, the bigger motive in her comments was to cover up her actual faux-pas with the Queen when, not surprisingly, brash Michelle showed a complete lack of respect and protocol when she got a little too touchy with her bullying her way into a hug and pushing her toward a chair, The Guardian previously reported.The Queen felt so grossly disrespected by Michelle that she royally snubbed the former first lady after the touchy-feely offense. When she flew into London with her mother and daughters in tow, expecting an audience with Queen Elizabeth only, she received a big slap-in-the-face instead, the Globe reported. Instead of spending the day with Michelle and her family who flew in to meet with her, the Queen ditched her and went off the horse race instead.Michelle may think she’s royalty and even try to act like it, but she’s got nothing on the actual Queen of England who’s the real deal and put her in her place when she changed plans. The Queen does what she wants which hopefully means that she kicks her off the coveted guest list too.

https://www.snopes.com/sarah-palin-lyme-disease/	Did Sarah Palin Say People with Lyme Disease Should Stop Eating Limes?	false	"['christians for michele bachmann', ' lyme disease', "" poe's law"", ' sarah palin']"	http://www.rollcall.com/	http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/health-care-determine-progress-agenda	2017/05/08	Health Care Will Determine Progress of Rest of AgendaSpending debate, tax code rewrite all interrelatedPosted May 8, 2017 5:05 AMSave for laterLast week’s legislative victories — finishing an omnibus spending bill and getting the rollback of the 2010 health care law through the House — are the foundation for the months of battles to come on Capitol Hill. Appropriators can begin to turn their attention toward the first full fiscal year of Donald Trump’s presidency, but their Senate colleagues will also have to deal with the procedural morass that comes with trying to reinvent the health care system through budget reconciliation.Indeed, the fate of the health care measure will likely determine what sort of progress can be made on everything Congress faces this year, from the basic task of funding the government to the more herculean one of rewriting the tax code, all in a time of increasing partisan tension in Washington.After the House vote, Senate Finance Chairman Orrin G. Hatch  said the chamber would focus on goals of reducing costs and increasing choice in health care, all with an eye toward majority support. At the same time, the Utah Republican acknowledged there would need to be compromises, which have been elusive so far.“Coupled with the constraints imposed by the budget reconciliation process, we must manage expectations and remain focused on the art of the doable as we move forward,” he said.Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said last week there was “no timeline” for moving forward with a Senate version of legislation to partially repeal and replace the Obama-era health care law, but the Texas Republican added that once they had 51 votes, the Senate would proceed.That won’t happen until senators and staff receive cost estimates from the Congressional Budget Office and understand the effect of the House-passed bill. This is because, in part, it would seem impossible to know if budgetary effects violate the Byrd Rule, which is key to reconciliation’s expedited floor procedure that allows a measure to pass the Senate without having to navigate a filibuster.All that could take weeks, and it is during this time that lawmakers are likely to see the presentation of the Trump administration’s first fully detailed budget request, with work beginning on fiscal 2018 spending on a truncated timeline.“I think that they are going to have a heck of a time coming to an agreement on their budget outline. Put aside the issues of what’s going to be put into the reconciliation package — in some ways that may be the easier part for them than actually putting the budget together,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen  said of the 2018 work.The Maryland Democrat, who joined the Appropriations Committee upon arrival in the Senate in January and who previously led Democrats on the House Budget Committee, questioned the feasibility of moving ahead on fiscal 2018 spending bills without a budget resolution.The timing of the fiscal 2018 budget resolution depends on what happens in health care debate. That’s because Republican leaders chose to use the fiscal 2017 budget resolution and the subsequent reconciliation instructions as the vehicle for their health care measure. If they were to pass a fiscal 2018 budget resolution, it could obviate the fiscal 2017 resolution. That’s important, because they want to use the fiscal 2018 resolution and its subsequent reconciliation process to tackle changing the tax code. In essence, health care needs to happen first, and it needs to happen before the current fiscal year is over Sept. 30, when the fiscal 2017 resolution expires. But it’s complicated because the fiscal 2018 budget resolution sets the top-line numbers for the appropriations process.So the process might be disjointed for as long as the health care debate goes on. Further complicating matters is that absent a new budget resolution’s top-line numbers, the automatic budget cuts known as sequestration bounce back, which would slash spending below levels generally acceptable to most members on both sides of the aisle.But Sen. Roy Blunt , the chairman of the Labor-HHS-Education subcommittee of Appropriations, suggested that members of that committee may get to work on the 12 Appropriations bills after Memorial Day.The Missouri Republican said he thought the process of crafting the fiscal 2017 omnibus was useful for the chairmen and vice chairmen at the Appropriations Committees on both sides of the Capitol because it handed them, “an opportunity to really work together and figure out how to negotiate a bill, which hadn’t happened in a while.”Cornyn echoed that sentiment, suggesting it might bode well for future spending discussions.“I think we should acknowledge that it actually represents a win, because it demonstrates the ability to negotiate something with Democrats in both houses of Congress that the White House agrees with, and there’s a lot of good things in there,” the Texas Republican said. “It’s always easy to find things to criticize in spending bills, but we’ve been forced to do this through an omnibus by the Democrats and this is the hand we’ve been dealt.”Cornyn was one of several Republicans to chastise Democrats for their opposition to calling up a standalone bill funding the Pentagon this year.“It’s not that I blame Mitch McConnell or anybody else. The Democrats would not allow us to move forward on the Defense appropriations bill. That’s got to stop. So, I just want everybody to have their say, have their amendments, get a vote and go back to normal order,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham , the State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee chairman. “We’re all in the same boat together. It’s not a good way to govern the country.”The South Carolinian ended up being one of the GOP appropriators to vote against the omnibus, citing key local concerns, including the status of the Export-Import Bank.It’s the nature of McConnell, who for years led Republicans on the subcommittee funding foreign operations, to want to prioritize appropriations bills, and Blunt said he expect the same in the upcoming summer when the Senate is not mired in the health care debate.“Many of the members will feel good about the ability to explain how we’ve prioritized. And I hope it drives more of an interest to have these bills actually on the floor,” Blunt said. “Some of our bills, I think, still could be ready to be on the floor in the June timeframe, and my guess is Sen. McConnell will want to allocate a lot of time to the appropriations process.”Sen. Patrick J. Leahy , the top Democrat on the Appropriations panel, signaled that he would be on board with such an effort.“It is my goal … to return to regular order, where we consider each appropriations bill in committee, debate each one publicly on the floor, and pass them individually. That is the way we should operate,” the longtime Vermont lawmaker said Thursday. “That is what the American people deserve. I look forward to working with the chairman to make this a reality when we turn, in very short order, to the fiscal year 2018 bills.”For Democrats, the wildcard won’t be Republican appropriators, but the Trump budget request — and the president himself.“I will say that it’s alarming to hear this president talk about a ‘good’ government shutdown. There are no good government shutdowns,” Van Hollen said, referring to a recent Trump tweet. “Normally, you would think only a hostile foreign power would want the United States government to shut down. It cost our economy $24 billion a few years ago for a 16-day shutdown.”Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android .

Meteorologists and weather science experts at the National Weather Service (NWS) say that there is a 99% chance that the we will start to see a massive cold-front sooner in the year than has ever happened, which will produce not just record-breaking snowfall, but according to Dr. Boris Scvediok, a doctor of global weather sciences, record shattering snow storms across the board, affecting the entire United States.“For the sake of comparison to the past winter, lets say that your area received a total of twenty inches of accumulative snow for the season. Because this year the snowfall is predicted to start by the end of September or the beginning of October, you can expect to multiply that number by up to five, ten, maybe even twenty times in some areas. In the worst zones, you could see 50 times the amount of snow you’ve had in the past. This is the type of winter the American public needs to prepare for. Several meteorologists are saying not to buy into what the models are showing. I can tell you from forty years of scientific weather research, they are doing you a disservice,” Dr. Scvediok told the Associated Press on Friday. “The Northeast, Ohio Valley, and Midwestern states will definitely get hit the hardest.”Edward F. Blankenbaker, Senior Administrator of Meteorologists, also told the media that this will be a once-in-a-lifetime kind of snowy winter.“Pretty much everyone will see snow like they never have in their lives. Most younger people don’t even know what an actual blizzard looks like, but by the end of March, they will be seasoned survivalists,” Blankenbaker said. “Everyone needs to make sure they have their weather emergency kits prepared and ready to go. There will undoubtably be mass power outages, which along with freezing temperatures and enough snowfall to immobilize entire cities, will most likely, and unfortunately, be a very dangerous recipe. Safety always comes first and the time to prepare is right now.”Thanks for the feedback! UndoWhat was wrong with this ad?InappropriateThanks for the feedback!

FDA spokesperson Rebecca Miller suggests alternatives in preparation of the coming months.“We are encouraging that you go out and purchase bulk amounts of dry, powdered milk which can be stored in your cupboards. This will prevent frantic trips to grocery stores and super markets as the onslaught of storms begin to fall upon your respected region.” Miller said. “As far as bread, we suggest you buy as much as you can efficiently store in your freezer. Bread can be frozen and thawed without compromising the integrity of its quality. Preparations such as these are crucial and the fact that technology has brought us to a time and place in which such events can be predicted is quite remarkable. So stock up on your powdered milk and fill your freezer with loaves of bread, because once the blankets of snow begin to fall, brave souls will confront the elements to raid stores of these products like some sort of scavenger hunt. Don’t be a part of the Snowpocolypse, it’s a dangerous battlefield of crazed shopping winter bitten weather zombies.”Stock up! Prices could more than triple in some locationsPublic safety organizations also encourage the masses to prepare themselves by obtaining proper necessities. James Satterfield from the National Fire and Safety Advisory Board says preparation can save lives. “Don’t wait until temperatures plummet into a freeze; obtain cold weather clothing and footwear, including wool thermal socks. It is also crucial to have plenty of batteries, candles, weather radios, you name it. Get prepared, it’s coming.” Satterfield stated. “First and foremost, make sure you have an effective plan in place to make sure you have plenty of bread and milk.”Dr. Scvediok says to be prepared for a storm that could come as early as the end of September, and plan for the entire winter season, which this year, he says, will more than likely spread into next June.
