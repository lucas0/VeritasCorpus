Roosevelt asked Americans to consider how our descendants would think about us in the future. “Let us hope,” he said, that they at least will “give us the benefit of the doubt, that they will believe we have honestly striven every day and generation to preserve for our descendants a decent land to live in and a decent form of government to operate under.” It is a question worth asking today. Since Roosevelt, the advent and spread of nuclear weapons has posed a threat to future generations. More recently, changes in climate and the earth’s ecosystem may pose similar threats to life on earth.Roosevelt’s answer to this question provides a yardstick for our efforts today. As thoughtful and responsible citizens of this great country, we should settle for no less - “a decent land to live in and a decent form of government to operate under.”Stay tuned for additional forthcoming issue statements.Restoring Our Democracy and Campaign Finance Reform Most Americans understand that our political system is fundamentally unfair. Through enormous campaign contributions, giant corporations and a handful of the wealthiest individuals are able to buy access to our elected officials and dictate legislative outcomes. This is perhaps the most important issue we face as a nation. If we don’t get big money out of politics, we will not accomplish what needs to be done for working families, the middle class, ordinary citizens. This is why my campaign is not taking a penny from corporations, their political action committees (PACs) or Super PACs. Instead, we are financing our campaign through thousands of small donations from ordinary citizens. When elected, I will not owe any special favors to any corporate interests or billionaire donors. This is in stark contrast to my opponent, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who has raised many millions of dollars from large corporate interests. Not surprisingly, her policy positions and votes in Congress largely reflect corporate agendas. No doubt, our distorted campaign finance system helped shift my opponent’s politics from progressive to corporate. And this is all too typical, with elected officials taking millions of dollars in corporate special interest money and then disregarding what is in the best interest of their own constituents. A comprehensive study by Princeton’s Martin Gilens and Northwestern University’s Benjamin Page confirms this dynamic. After analyzing nearly 2000 policy issues in detail, they conclude: “The preferences of the average American appear to have only a miniscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.” This is not the picture of a strong, vibrant democracy. We can do much better. As a law professor and activist, I have been a steadfast critic of the Citizens United 5-to-4 decision by the Supreme Court that has allowed a flood of dark money from phantom donors into our politics. As Senator Bernie Sanders has noted, “The Citizens United decision hinges on the absurd notion that money is speech, corporations are people, and giving huge piles of undisclosed cash to politicians in exchange for access and influence does not constitute corruption.” According to the Center for Responsive Politics, there has been more than half a billion dollars of such dark money in our politics since Citizens United. By the end of this presidential election, that figure will certainly be well more than a billion dollars. This is why I support a Constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United and why I believe reversing Citizens United should be a litmus test for any nominee to the Supreme Court. When elected, I intend to organize a bipartisan caucus in which members of Congress are pledged to reforming our campaign finance system and cleaning up our political system. While my opponent also calls for overturning Citizens United, this is part of her pattern of saying one thing and doing another. She says she’s for small-donor driven elections, but she raises millions of dollars from large corporations and their PACs and Super PACs. She has voted for a bill to prevent the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from forcing corporations to disclose their campaign spending to shareholders, and to block the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from curbing special interest donors from forming sham “social welfare” organizations that hide their political spending. These measures were in Omnibus spending packages that she voted for without lodging a single word of protest. As of February 26, 2016, she has refused to co-sponsor the DISCLOSE Act, introduced by Congressman Chris Van Hollen (with more than 110 co-sponsors), to shine a light on the flood of special-interest money. And in mid-February, it was reported that the Democratic National Committee (DNC), which Wasserman Schultz leads, reversed President Obama’s 2008 ban on the DNC taking money from corporate lobbyists. President Obama was right to ban lobbyist donations because it raises all kinds of conflicts of interest and corrodes our politics, and leads to sweetheart legislation for large companies while costing taxpayers billions of dollars. The U.S. is one of only a small handful of democracies around the world that does not have publicly financed elections. We must separate corporate treasuries from public elections, and implement a transparent system of publicly-financed campaigns that amplifies small donations. Candidates for federal elections should be given free TV and cable airtime. After all, the public owns the airwaves, and TV and cable companies have benefitted from billions of dollars in public subsidies. Candidates should not have to sell out to special interests in order to raise money to pay these huge media corporations just to communicate with voters. We must also restore the full protections of the Voting Rights Act, which the Supreme Court has recently gutted. We should expand early voting and vote-by-mail, and implement automatic voter registration. We also need to abolish the felon disenfranchisement laws – particularly in Florida – that deprive millions of citizens of their voting rights, often for life and frequently for non-violent drug possession offenses committed years ago. Of significant importance as well, we must end the practice of gerrymandering, which draws the lines of Congressional districts in a manner that results in “safe” Democratic or Republican seats, making elected officials largely unaccountable at the voting booth. That’s why incumbents stay in office year after year, often for decades, turning them into professional politicians who no longer feel any urgency to represent the interests of the actual people who comprise their own constituents. That’s why members of Congress usually get reelected at rates of over 90 percent, while barely 10 percent of the public approves of the job Congress is doing. And this is why primary challenges like mine are often the only effective way to force accountability on entrenched incumbents. Here at home, for instance, Florida’s 23rd Congressional District is seen as a safe Democratic seat. My opponent has been reelected over and over, and has never faced a primary challenger, ever! And with no primary challenger in a safely Democratic seat, there is no genuine discussion, much less debate, within our district as to the serious issues facing all of us, and the overall direction of our country. This is why progressive activist and labor scholar Amy Dean has recognized our campaign as a potential game changer: “If [Tim Canova’s] insurgent campaign catches on, it could represent a serious problem for the Democratic Party establishment. It could signal an increasing willingness by grass-roots activists to use primary challenges to place champions for working people in office rather than accept lesser-evil candidates simply because they are incumbents.” This is why Zach Carter at the Huffington Post has written that our race in FL-23 “could well reveal more about the Democratic Party than any other contest in this cycle, including the one for president. . . . It’s a test of whether progressive ideas or corporate money are more central to the Democratic Party’s future.” When we win on August 30th, we will show the way for other ordinary citizens to challenge incumbents who have been seduced by the flood of corporate money. We are already working with others who are developing the online platforms and shared campaign infrastructure that will enable insurgent candidates, potentially in every Congressional district, to raise funds through millions of small donations. This is the way we shall overcome the barriers to effective collective action and enable progressive reformers to win primaries all across the country – giving a voice in our democracy back to actual ordinary people. Much is at stake. So many other reforms that we need – from regulating Wall Street, to rebuilding our infrastructure, addressing climate change, providing job opportunities for all, making higher education affordable, protecting consumers, rebalancing our trade relations, and much more – are made so much more difficult as long as obscene amounts of money from giant companies and a few wealthy donors continue to distort our politics. We must un-rig the system. That’s what our campaign is all about.Reversing Income and Wealth InequalityFor the past three decades, I have been speaking out against the growing inequality in income and wealth in the United States – while serving as a legislative aide on Capitol Hill in the 1980s, while practicing law in the 1990s, and as a legal scholar ever since. In fact, the distribution of wealth and income is now more top-heavy than anytime since the Gilded Age of the 1890s and the Roaring 1920s. Incredibly, the top one-tenth of one percent now owns as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. And almost 60 percent of all new income since the 2008 financial crash has gone to the top 1 percent. We are now in a New Gilded Age.What are some of the main causes of all this inequality? Tax PolicyEconomists can point to “supply side” tax cuts, which reduced the tax rates for high-income earners. But the theory that tax cuts for the wealthy would somehow lead to economic growth to everyone’s benefit was nothing more than “voodoo economics” – as even George H.W. Bush candidly recognized while running in the presidential primary against Ronald Reagan over 30 years ago. Rather than mysteriously “trickle-down” to ordinary working folks, tax cut savings for the very wealthy are more likely to flow out of the U.S. to off-shore tax havens. Unfortunately, proponents of ever-more tax cuts for the wealthy never learned the lesson of history. The trickle-down tax cuts of the 1920s culminated in the Great Depression. Likewise, the Bush tax cuts of the early 2000s culminate in our own Great Recession, the adverse consequences of which are still with us today. Presently, the top bracket has a marginal income tax rate of 39.6 percent, far below the marginal tax rates that prevailed from the 1940s to 1980s, a period when the U.S. enjoyed not just a much more equitable distribution of income and wealth, but also far higher economic growth rates, rising real wages, and stronger labor markets. More troubling is that the top tax bracket begins at an income of $413,200, which means that a family with such an income is in the same tax bracket as those with annual incomes that are 10 or 100 times higher or even more. A hedge fund manager can make a billion dollars and actually pay a lower effective marginal tax rate thanks to the “carried interest” exemption. For more than the past 100 years, since the start of the modern tax code in 1913, our country has implemented what is known as a progressive federal income tax, meaning that tax rates get progressively higher as taxable income increases, with a larger percentage of income being paid by high-income groups, a lower percentage of income paid by middle-income groups, and an even lower percentage of income being paid by low-income groups. Cutting top tax rates for the wealthiest families reduces the progressive nature of our federal tax code, and undermines the concept of “ability to pay” and the goal of inherent fairness upon which our system of taxation is supposed to be based. I have always opposed the supply-side tax cuts of the Reagan and Bush administrations, and I have always supported increasing the progressivity in our federal income tax system. I was against extending the Bush tax cuts during the first Obama administration, while my opponent, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, supported extension of the Bush tax cuts. I believe there should be more tax brackets at the high end of the income distribution scale, with higher marginal tax rates imposed on those making millions and billions of dollars a year. Otherwise, the tax burden falls too harshly on working families, the middle class, and small- and medium-sized business owners, even those trying to make their first million. We should also put an end to “corporate inversions” and other loopholes that allow corporations and wealthy individuals move their money into offshore tax havens, while taking advantage of federal subsidies and access to the largest consumer market in the world. Monetary PolicyAnother source of our growing income and wealth inequality is related to the Federal Reserve and monetary policy. Since the 2008 financial collapse, the central bank has purchased several trillion dollars in assets from the largest Wall Street financial institutions, while making tens of trillions of dollars in near zero-interest loans to these big banks. Meanwhile, millions of ordinary Americans were wiped out by the crash, they lost their homes to foreclosure, they lost their jobs, and they lost their life savings - and yet the Fed has done virtually nothing to help them. This is totally inexcusable. In the 1930s and 1940s, the Federal Reserve provided loans directly to “Main Street” small- and medium-sized businesses, and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) – essentially a federal infrastructure bank – provided billions of dollars in grants and loans to rebuild the economy. But since 2008, the Federal Reserve has provide no assistance to Main Street and we’re still waiting for a federal infrastructure bank – something that’s been promised in presidential election campaigns in 1992 and 2008 and that many economic powerhouses with modern infrastructures, like Germany, Japan, and China, have had for years. Financial RegulationFinancial deregulation has resulted in more income inequality. Big Wall Street banks have been allowed to impose all sorts of fees on low-income customers. They charge high interest rates on predatory and subprime loans. They pay near zero interest to bank customers on their deposits. My opponent, after taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, has co-sponsored a bill to prevent the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFTP) from regulating payday loans and addressing racial discrimination in car loans. This reverses the progress made by President Obama and Senator Elizabeth Warren in significant parts of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 - the Obama administration’s main legislative response to the 2008 financial collapse. In contrast, I have spent my entire career opposing financial deregulation for the big banks, and calling for regulation of lending standards. I warned against watering down and then abolishing the Glass-Steagall Act firewalls that had separated commercial banking from investment banking and risky securities markets for decades. And I support breaking up these huge financial institutions that have become too big to fail, too big to jail, and too big to manage. Trade AgreementsAs the U.S. has entered into trade agreements with far less developed countries, this has also undermined U.S. wage rates and American jobs, further aggravating the economic inequality in our country. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) of 1994 was the first free trade agreement between 1st World and 3rd World countries. American workers quickly saw their jobs outsourced to Mexico. Then a decade later, the U.S. entered into permanent normal trade relations with the People’s Republic of China, a communist dictatorship with no independent trade union movement, no political freedoms, and far lower wage rates, labor standards, and environmental protections. As a law professor, scholar and activist, I opposed these types of trade policies , including NAFTA, permanent normal trade relations with China, and China’s membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO). My opponent, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, has been complicit in these bad trade deals. She supported the Korean Trade Agreement that resulted in the loss of tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs in Florida. She voted to fast-track the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) that will destroy hundreds of thousands of American jobs in the future. And she did this after taking more than $300,000 in campaign contributions in 2012-2014, and no doubt much more since, from corporate interests lobbying for the TPP. I do not take corporate money, period. And I opposed fast-tracking the TPP and I oppose the TPP. I Won’t Back DownI have been warning about these trends in income and wealth inequality - in countless articles, book chapters, and public speeches since the early 1990s - and for much of that time it certainly did not help my career to attack supply-side tax cuts, free trade agreements, banking deregulation, and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan’s monetary policies. But I never backed down. When elected to Congress, I will continue to fight for fairness in the tax system. Wealthy citizens and large corporations must pay their fair share in taxes. I will support an increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020, along with special protections for small businesses. And I will fight for active fiscal and monetary policies that rebuild our infrastructure, provide jobs in construction and manufacturing, and extend credit to small- and medium-sized businesses that have been neglected by big Wall Street banks. We can do this. Everyone knows that we must make the investments necessary to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, from roads and bridges, to public transit, high-speed rail, water and sewage treatment systems, and a new smart electricity grid. In addition, we must rebalance our trade relations. I will fight against unfair trade agreements and I will push for trade sanctions against countries that violate the human rights of their own citizens, lack basic minimal labor and environmental standards, and manipulate their currencies to undermine our manufacturing base. Meanwhile, we should strengthen our own protections for union organizing and collective bargaining. The unionization rate for the U.S. private sector is now down around 7 percent and that’s one of the main reasons for the stagnation in U.S. wages and the decline in the middle class. That’s why I support the Employee Free Choice Act, which would provide an easier system for employees to form or join a labor union to protect their rights and make a decent living wage. Much of the country, as I do, supports Senator Bernie Sanders’ agenda to help the Main Streets of America. We can create millions of jobs for young men and women by investing in jobs programs. We must demand pay equity for women. We can make tuition free at public colleges and universities, as they were for my dad’s generation after World War II with the G.I. Bill of Rights program. And like Senator Sanders, I support paying for this with a small turnover tax – the so-called “Robin Hood tax” - on financial transactions. In fact, I have advocated for just such a tax since the early 1990s – it was then known as the Tobin Tax, after the late James Tobin, a Nobel laureate in economics and the head of President John F. Kennedy’s Council of Economic Advisers. As Dr. Tobin said at the time, an added benefit of such a turnover tax, would be “throwing sand in the gears of the speculators.” We should be deterring and taxing financial speculation to provide the policy space for governments to pursue full-employment policies. Rather than cutting benefits to the elderly, I support expanding Social Security by lifting the cap on taxable income above $250,000 so that those earning more -- and in many cases much, much more -- pay a bit more into the system. I have also called on the Florida Congressional delegation to co-sponsor legislation introduced by Senator Elizabeth Warren to expand assistance to our poorest seniors and disabled people under the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. Although more than 124,000 seniors in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties live below the poverty line , my opponent has dragged her feet on this issue and as of February 2016 still had not co-sponsored this effort to strengthen the safety-net for citizens most in need. I believe we should improve upon the Affordable Care Act (ACA), President Obama’s main health care initiative, by moving to a “Medicare for all” single-payer healthcare system that guarantees every citizen health care as a basic right. Many of our trading partners and competitors have single-payer healthcare, as well as paid family and medical leave. We should require employers to provide at least 2 weeks of paid vacation; 7 days of paid sick days; and 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave – as is done in Germany and many other capitalist democracies that are outcompeting us on trade. As Senator Sanders has said, “Real family values are about making sure that parents have the time they need to bond with their babies and take care of their children and relatives when they get ill.” And we need a universal childcare and prekindergarten program to support the development of our children in their most formative years. These are just some of the policy prescriptions that we can employ to improve the lives of our neighbors in South Florida and millions of other citizens throughout the United States. We live in the wealthiest country in human history, but the current trend of income and wealth distribution is completely upside down. For the past four decades, the rules have been rigged in favor of Wall Street and the billionaire class. Now it’s time for them to pay their fair share, to make sure that we all can make a decent living. Addressing Climate Change and Protecting South Florida’s EnvironmentClimate change is a global challenge. Here in South Florida, it is not simply a theoretical problem, but a very real and growing threat to our homes, businesses and neighborhoods. We already see the erosion of our seawalls, corrosion of critical infrastructure, and salt water intruding into the aquifers we rely on for our drinking water.Yet, our elected officials have been slow to act. Addressing climate change must be a national priority. We need to reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses into the environment by aggressively reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and harmful environmental practices like fracking. I was proud to stand with South Florida environmental groups, labor, community activists, the League of Cities, the Association of Counties and others who opposed the harmful state legislative bills that would have made it easier for big oil and gas companies to bring fracking to our state. In addition to clearing a path to potential environmental disasters, these fracking bills would have taken away local municipalities’ ability to pass local ordinances to protect their own constituents.We must focus our efforts on transitioning to sustainable, clean energy sources to power our future. For many years, I have supported a carbon tax, as well as cap-and-trade proposals. I reject arguments that somehow these initiatives would hamper our economy. There is no good reason for the U.S. to be lagging behind other major countries, like Germany, in converting to alternative, renewable energy sources. By allowing other countries to take the lead in the research, development and innovation of this growing market, we put our country’s role in developing these revolutionary technologies at risk.The reality of climate change will demand that we make huge investments in critical infrastructure in the coming years, from reinforcing sea walls and raising streets to protecting our electrical grid and modernizing sewage and water treatment facilities. This is why I have taken the Climate Mobilization Pledge in support of a program on the scale of the World War II mobilization of human, industrial, and financial resources to restore a safe climate. I want the United States to have net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 and to make tremendous investments in carbon capture and sequestration technologies to actively remove carbon dioxide from our atmosphere.While my opponent Debbie Wasserman Schultz says that she’s for addressing climate change and protecting our local environment, her words ring hollow in light of her actions. Despite stating on her official website that protecting the Everglades is a “fundamental responsibility” that she does not take lightly, my opponent is consistently ranked as one of members of the Congress who accepts the most money from the sugar lobby. She has voted multiple times to reauthorize and extend millions of dollars in corporate welfare to the sugar industry. Worse still, sugar producers have been identified as the chief polluters of the Everglades, an ecosystem that plays a critical role in in maintaining the health of the Biscayne Aquifer – the fresh water source for millions of Floridians.When thinking of how to best address climate change I am reminded of a Greek proverb: “a society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.” When I am elected to Congress I will make sure we protect South Florida’s environment and stand up to the Big Sugar industry that threatens our fragile ecosystems and drinking water. I will not rest until our country makes serious progress to combat climate change and protect our environment, both locally and across the globe. Simply stated, climate change is a problem that South Florida must face head on, and I am committed to leading the charge so that future generations may continue to enjoy this planet we call home. Ending the War on DrugsI have opposed the misguided drug war for many years. We should not be locking people up for using the same drugs that have been used by at least the last three American presidents and, according to many surveys, by a majority of American people. As an activist and a law professor, I have been involved in the grassroots movement to decriminalize drugs. The goal should be to let adults make their own decisions as long as they are not harming themselves and others, let the States and their voters decide their own drug policies, and treat drug abuse as a public health issue, rather than burdening our criminal justice system. And the federal government should get out of the way.In Florida, I supported the 2014 medical marijuana referendum that garnered about 58 percent of the vote state-wide, falling just short of the required 60 percent mark. My opponent, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, is a drug warrior who opposed the medical marijuana referendum. Calling marijuana a “gateway” drug, she refuses to allow her constituents in South Florida, in consultation with their doctors, to decide for themselves whether to utilize this plant-based medicine to alleviate pain and other symptoms of various illnesses and the side effects of other medications. Certain industries have a special interest in keeping marijuana illegal - for example, the alcohol and pharmaceutical industries, both of which view recreational and medicinal use of marijuana as a competitive threat; and the private prison industry, which profits from warehousing people in jails, including for marijuana possession. Not surprisingly, having taken in lots of campaign donations from the alcohol, pharmaceutical, and private prison industries and their political action committees (PACs), Debbie Wasserman Schultz opposes medical marijuana and supports privatized prisons and mass incarceration. Unlike my opponent, I do not take any contributions from these special interests, or from any corporate interests at all.In addition to Florida’s medical marijuana referendum, I also support the recent reforms by Miami-Dade and Broward Counties to decriminalize marijuana for personal use, and I call on the federal government to “de-schedule” marijuana from the list of controlled and dangerous substances. Far more serious than recreational marijuana use is the rise of illegal pill mills, the over-prescription of opioids, the enormous increase in heroin abuse, and the epidemic of flakka, synthetic crystals and bath salts imported from China, which has turned many users into paranoid and often violent zombies with superhuman strength and off-the-charts near-death vital signs. In the first year since the flakka epidemic began in Broward County, 60 people have died as a result, with hospitals getting dozens of overdosed patients a day, and on some nights, half the calls to police are flakka-related emergencies. Likewise, opioid use has resulted in an alarming rise in overdose deaths around the country, including in more affluent areas, and particularly in South Florida. These are the type of drugs on which we should be focusing our law enforcement and public health efforts.In many of the states that have moved in the direction of legalization and regulation of marijuana for personal use, entire new industries are flourishing, adding jobs and increasing tax revenues, and crime rates are falling. While I support state efforts to allow individuals to make their own decisions, I also recognize the need to provide young people -- and people of all ages -- with many more job and educational opportunities in a time of decriminalization and legalization.While ending the drug war presents a range of challenges, there is no doubt that the drug war itself has been a costly disaster for millions of individuals, families, and taxpayers. An entire private prison industry has arisen that lobbies for harsh drug wars with severe sentencing. The drug war institutionalizes racial, generational, and economic injustice, by disproportionately punishing people of color, young people, and people with lower incomes at far greater rates than the population as a whole. For instance, although surveys show that illicit drug use is no higher among people of color, African-American men are arrested at many times the rate of white men on drug charges in the U.S., and at even higher rates in Florida. The drug war results in mass incarceration. More than half a million people are languishing behind bars on drug charges in the U.S., breaking up and often irreparably destroying families. And there are other collateral consequences. People convicted of even misdemeanor drug offenses, including marijuana possession, are denied access to education, housing and federal financial aid under federal law, and frequently will find that they are virtually barred from the job market. In Florida and some other states, those convicted of non-violent drug felonies are barred for life from voting, even after they have served their sentences, regardless of whether they are responsibly employed, paying taxes, and raising families. In 2001, I helped spearhead the grassroots lobbying campaign that overturned New Mexico’s felon disenfranchisement law, and worked successfully with a Republican governor to do so. Unfortunately, Florida leads the country in felon disenfranchisement. According to the New York Times "" more than one in ten Floridians – and nearly one in four African American Floridians – are shut out of the polls because of felony convictions ,"" most of which are non-violent drug felonies.Public opinion surveys show that people across the country, and particularly in South Florida, want to end this misguided drug war. Unfortunately, powerful industries continue to lobby for the drug war – including the same pharmaceutical, alcohol, and private prison companies from which my opponent readily takes large amounts of money. It is time to take corporate money out of politics, end the drug war, and provide legal and healthy alternatives for everyone. People should have the freedom to decide with their doctors whether to use medical marijuana, and to decide for themselves whether to use marijuana recreationally. We don’t need more prisons. We need more jobs and more educational opportunities as alternatives to drug dealing and chronic drug use. And for those who are caught in the grip of the disease of drug addiction, rather than warehouse them in prisons as punishment, we need more treatment programs to provide a better means to help them recover.Regulating Payday Lending and Stopping the Vicious Cycle of DebtThough economists tell us that the 2008 Great Recession ended years ago, many Americans have been left behind by the economic recovery. In this time of so much economic uncertainty, millions of hardworking American families are living paycheck to paycheck and are increasingly relying on payday loans to keep up with their bills and make ends meet.Payday loans are short-term loans, generally less than $500 in value that come due when the borrower collects their next paycheck. While the amounts being borrowed are relatively low, the interest rates on these loans are shockingly high. Most credit cards companies charge between 15 and 30 percent annual interest, but payday lenders typically charge more than 300 percent annual interest for their loans. Worse yet, due to the high cost of borrowing and the very short repayment period for payday loans, the consumers that rely on them often become trapped in what President Obama called “a vicious cycle of debt.”Despite their predatory lending tactics, the universal outcry of consumer protection groups and the condemnation of leaders such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren and President Obama, my opponent Debbie Wasserman Schultz has accepted tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from payday lenders . If this were not enough, my opponent has also joined Republicans in co-sponsoring a bill that would delay the regulation of payday lenders for years and continue to burden millions of working families with endless debt. This is why the editorial board of the Sun Sentinel has called on Wasserman Schultz to “ not swim with loan sharks .”Debbie Wasserman Schultz has also voted to prevent President Obama’s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) from issuing regulations against “racial redlining” in the auto loan market. There should be no place in our society for these kinds of predatory financial practices, including those that discriminate against people on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender or other personal characteristics.When I am elected to Congress I promise to regulate the payday lending industry. I will work hard to limit the loan shark style practices of the payday lending industry and the debt traps they work so hard to create. I also promise to propose alternatives – like postal banking – to give working families access to the type of small loans they may need in an emergency, but at much lower interest rates. By working together, we can put a stop to this greedy industry that exploits hard working families and find new solutions for the people of Florida. U.S. Support of Israel and Leadership for Peace and Human Rights in the Middle EastIsrael and its security needsI was raised in a blended family, Catholic on my mother’s side and with a loving Jewish stepdad for the past forty years. We observed Jewish holy days, honored Jewish traditions, and learned much about Israel from many friends and loved ones who had visited. In the year before I started law school, I decided to live and work on a kibbutz in Israel. I developed a deep attachment to the land and people of Israel, and a deep commitment to Israel as a democratic Jewish state. I also remain fully committed to a two-state solution that includes a democratic Palestinian state and I believe the U.S. must play an active role in promoting the resumption of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.Any peace settlement must respect and safeguard the human rights of both the Israeli and Palestinian people. This would require difficult compromises by both sides, and I believe the U.S. could play a constructive role in encouraging the peace process through the judicious use of incentives and rewards for each side. It is difficult to imagine the peace process moving forward until Israel’s neighbors accept Israel’s right to exist and recognize her legitimate security needs. The Iran nuclear agreementThe gravest threat to Israeli security would be nuclear proliferation in the region. Israel’s most dangerous adversary has been Iran, which has funded and armed Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. While I have criticized several deficiencies in the Iran nuclear deal (no international agreement is ever perfect), now that it has been entered into, I support its full implementation. What were my concerns with the agreement? I was troubled by the inspections protocols. I also thought that a more measured and incremental lifting of sanctions and release of frozen assets would have provided continuing incentives for Iran to comply not just with the nuclear deal but also with its anti-ballistic missile commitments. I was also concerned that the wholesale lifting of sanctions and release of assets may strengthen hardliners in Iran. In a democracy like ours, it is important for citizens and elected representatives to critically scrutinize proposed international treaties and executive agreements, whether they be trade deals or arms control agreements. Now that the Iran nuclear deal has been adopted by all parties, I support its full implementation and I would not support any efforts by the U.S. to unilaterally scrap the agreement.Wars of regime changeI have opposed every war of regime change in the Middle East, from the Iraq War to the civil wars in Libya and Syria. These countries have also become battlegrounds for seemingly never-ending proxy wars between Saudi Arabia and Iran, two misogynistic, authoritarian regimes that pursue radical and often violent visions of Islamic fundamentalism. The results have been terrible bloodshed and carnage for the people of the battleground countries and a Syrian refugee crisis of catastrophic proportions. Meanwhile, the Islamic State (ISIS) has spread throughout Iraq, Syria, Libya and elsewhere, and now threatens Israel’s northern border with Syria. Unfortunately, many outside countries – the U.S. included – remain complicit in this bloodshed by arming and funding the regimes and proxy armies in the region. The U.S. must do everything in its power to reverse the militarization of the region, including full diplomatic efforts to negotiate a general disarmament for the entire region that includes nuclear, missile, and conventional arms reductions.We should recognize that peace and security for Israel, the U.S., and the rest of the world is no longer possible without general disarmament and fundamental political and social reforms - specifically in Iran, Saudia Arabia and among other state sponsors of terror - throughout the Middle East. We must work to bring about such reform as much as possible through non-violent peaceful means using the full range of U.S. economic and diplomatic power.Sensible, Humane, and Comprehensive Immigration ReformOur world is more interconnected than ever before. Because of this, the economic, social, and political instability of countries all over the world often create ripple effects here at home. These effects are often most visible in the form of immigration.America is a country built by generations of immigrants who came to its shores in search of a better life. Today, the United States continues to be a prime destination for those seeking opportunity, prosperity, or refuge for themselves and their families. However, welcoming immigrants in the 21st century presents problems that we did not face in the past. Our country needs to reform its immigration policy so that we have sensible and humane solutions to the challenges of today while continuing to attract the world’s best and brightest to help build a better tomorrow for all Americans.When I am elected to Congress I will fight tirelessly to forge a fair path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants in the country. I will support the expansion of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) programs so that people, like the Dreamers, who have lived in America most of their lives are not forced to return to countries they no longer recognize or call home. I also intend to reform student and skilled worker visa programs so that we can continue to attract the best talent to America and lead the world in technology and innovation for generations to come. While advocating for a more humane policy for undocumented immigrants, I also support enhancing our border security. Unfortunately, weak border security has at times provided a safety valve for corrupt and repressive regimes south of our border. The U.S. has to do more to be both a good neighbor and encourage democratic reforms in those countries to our south.Ending For-profit Prisons and the Era of Mass IncarcerationDuring the 1980’s, as America was dramatically expanding its long and misguided War on Drugs, federal and state governments were incarcerating so many people that they could no longer build prisons fast enough to house all the new inmates. To meet the demands of an overburdened system, private companies began building and managing prisons in an effort to make money off the endless stream of prisoners that were being locked away.Since then, for-profit prisons have become a multi-billion dollar industry and the companies that build them are now traded on the New York Stock Exchange. To guarantee profitability for shareholders, most of these companies sign contracts that require federal, state, and local governments to maintain certain levels of prison occupancy or taxpayers are forced to cover the cost of any empty beds in these for-profit facilities. In turn, these contracts incentivize governments to imprison people for minor and often non-violent offenses in order to satisfy the requirements of these contracts.To further secure their profitability, private prison companies are spending millions of dollars every year lobbying politicians to maintain and promote the sort of flawed policies that keep private prisons full, such as mandatory minimum sentencing, three strikes, and truth-in-sentencing laws that prevent people from qualifying for parole. These policies are often not only counterproductive, but they have also been consistently proven to disproportionately affect poor and minority communities.In spite of the all negative effects of for-profit prisons, my opponent has accepted thousands of dollars from the for-profit prison industry since she came into office. In 2011, Debbie Wasserman Schultz even actively lobbied to have a $100 million for-profit prison facility built within her district, in Southwest Ranches, despite widespread opposition by people living in the neighborhood.I do not believe that these are the kinds of businesses that we should be attracting to Florida’s 23rd Congressional District. When I am elected to Congress I will fight tirelessly to stop the for-profit privatization of our nation’s prisons. I will do so because while I strongly believe in punishing hardened criminals for breaking the law, it is immoral to support an industry that makes millions of dollars from unfairly targeting the poor and minority communities by sending more people to jail for minor and nonviolent offenses. Making Higher Education Affordable for all AmericansMy parents instilled in me the value of an education. They always told me and my siblings that we had to work hard and go to school so that we could better ourselves. Through college, and then law school, I worked hard so that I could attain the opportunities my parents promised would come with a college degree. However, with each passing year, higher education is becoming more unaffordable. As a law professor, I see my students graduate hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt before they ever even pass the bar exam. I do not believe that young people – especially in a country as rich as ours - should mortgage themselves to get an education.In today’s economy, everyone should have the opportunity to attain a four year college degree. I am in favor of a 0.5% Robin Hood Tax on Wall Street to pay for free tuition at public colleges and universities. I am also proposing a Voluntary National Service Program that would allow young Americans right out of high school to serve for two years in their choice of civilian or military service. Civilian service would include a Land & Sea Conservation Corps, Works Projects, and National Youth Administration. In return, volunteers would be eligible to receive tuition free higher education and living stipends while they study – like the GI Bill of Rights did for my dad and the entire WWII generation.Furthermore, it is absurd that Wall Street banks get access to credit from the Federal Reserve at interest rates below one percent, yet students pay seven percent and higher on their school loans. I support charging half a percentage point (0.5%) interest rate on student loans- a small service charge. The federal government should not be making more than $30 billion a year off the backs of students. With these and other reforms we can prepare the young people of today for the jobs of tomorrow’s economy. Investing in educating America’s youth is an investment in our future. Preserving a Woman’s Right to Choose and Fighting for Equal Pay for Equal WorkOver the last hundred years our country has made many advancements to protect the rights of women. Today however many of these hard fought rights are under attack by Republicans and others who want to deny women access to their health and reproductive rights. There are even many who still insist on opposing the efforts to guarantee women equal pay for equal work. I firmly believe that we cannot have true progress in America unless we have progress for all. It is incredible that more than forty years after Roe v. Wade a woman’s right to control her reproductive health remains under attack.It is shameful that women are still paid less than men for performing the same work. It is because of this that I support equal pay for equal work and want to ensure that all women have access to the health services they are guaranteed by law. But this is not enough. We need to do and demand more.When I am elected to Congress I will not rest until employers are required to provide employees with 12 weeks of paid family leave so that all Americans can care for their loved ones in their time of need. I fully support the development of free universal childcare for all American families because working parents should not have to choose between providing for their children or leaving them home alone. I also want to expand the availability of pre-kindergarten education programs so that all children, irrespective of class or circumstance, can have access to these programs in the most critical stages of their development. Together we can secure the rights of women across the country and build a better, more compassionate America for ourselves and future generations.Ensuring Equality for our LGBTQ Brothers and Sisters In recent years our country has made tremendous strides to advance the rights of our LGBTQ brothers and sisters. It was not long ago that gay Americans could not receive benefits from their spouses, serve openly in the military, or marry the ones they love. Though our country has come very far in a short time, there is a still a lot of work to be done before we have full equality for all Americans. Today, despite our recent progress, more than half of all U.S states do not protect against discrimination in employment, housing, or public accommodation on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. Several states have recently passed laws overruling local governments from banning discrimination against LGBTQ people.This is unacceptable. In a fair and just society there should be no room for state sanctioned bigotry based on gender identity or sexual orientation. That is why when I am elected to Congress I will fight to end discrimination in all its forms. I intend to cosponsor the Equality Act which would provide LGBTQ Americans with anti-discrimination protections in the areas of housing, employment, and education, among others. I also plan on working to pass the Every Child Deserves a Family Act which would prohibit adoption or foster care placement services that receive federal funding from denying a prospective parent the ability to adopt or foster a child because of the parent’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status. With your support we can work together to create a fairer and more equitable America for everyone. Protecting and Expanding Social SecurityIt is a sad a reality that rising health care and housing costs are pushing many American seniors into poverty. According to the latest government figures, 6.4 million Americans over age 65 are living in poverty. In 2013, 9 percent of all households that included seniors experienced hunger. If present trends continue, those numbers are projected to increase by 50 percent in the next decade, while homelessness among seniors is projected to double over the next three decades.In Florida, 11 percent of seniors over 65 live below the poverty line, which is $11,770 a year for a senior living alone. It’s even worse in South Florida. In Miami-Dade, more than 22 percent of seniors aged 65 and over live in poverty, in Broward County about 14 percent of such seniors live in poverty — that’s more than 124,000 seniors in Miami-Dade and Broward counties living below the poverty line. Thousands of seniors, many who thought they were prepared for retirement before the 2008 recession decimated their life savings, now find themselves choosing between food and medicine every day.Some of the hardest-hit seniors are those receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI). SSI is a safety-net program administered by the Social Security Administration that provides a very basic income to the poorest people among us — older adults and people with disabilities who have little or no other income or resources.The full federal monthly benefit available for individual SSI recipients is $733, a figure that requires recipients to live at just 75 percent of the federal poverty level. However, SSI has not been substantially updated since it was signed into law in 1972. Debbie Wasserman Schultz has not responded to this crisis. She has yet to co-sponsor the Supplemental Security Income Restoration Act of 2015, which would help many SSI recipients from having to struggle with homelessness, hunger or malnutrition. Meanwhile, I have been working with advocates for seniors and people with disabilities in support of this bill for many months. Despite all these dangers to the safety and security of America’s seniors, there are many in Congress who want to cut and push back the eligibility for Social Security benefits. This is unacceptable. When I am elected to Congress I will not only protect Social Security but expand it by lifting the cap on Social Security taxable income above the current $118,500 so that those earning more – and in many cases much, much more – pay their fair share into the system. I intend to support efforts by several lawmakers in Washington — led by Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Sherrod Brown and Bernie Sanders — to update the SSI program’s income and asset limits to make them more in line with today’s economic realities, so that seniors who rely on SSI can continue to buy food, stay in their homes and access the health care they need. This a simple, reasonable fix that would make life just a little bit easier for the more 550,000 Florida SSI recipients who have nothing else to fall back on.As the Social Security program celebrates its 80th birthday this year, it’s time to commit not only to preserving the nation’s most successful anti-poverty program, but also expanding it so that it can continue to provide hope and dignity to growing numbers of seniors.Universal Health Care and Medicare for AllThe passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was a monumental achievement. With the stroke of a pen, President Obama signed into law the most important health care reform since Johnson’s Great Society. Through the ACA, millions of Americans have gained access to health insurance that was previously too expensive or otherwise unattainable. It is because of the ACA that insurers can no longer deny coverage because of preexisting conditions, drop policy holders when they get sick, or issue policies with lifetime dollar limits on essential benefits. Simply put, the ACA was a transformational piece of legislation, but I know we can do better.The United States remains the only major developed country that does not provide universal health care to all its citizens. Generations of American leaders – Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson, among others - have tried to guarantee health care to all Americans, without success. Despite the reforms of the ACA, tens of millions of Americans still do not have health insurance. Millions more are underinsured, cannot afford high priced deductibles and co-payments, or are forced to declare bankruptcy because they simply cannot afford to pay their medical bills. This should not happen in a fair and just America. I firmly believe that health care is a universal human right and it is because of this that I want to improve upon the Affordable Care Act, by moving to a “Medicare for all” single-payer health care system that would guarantee every citizen health care as a basic right. That said, on the road to creating a universal health care system for all Americans, we must not ignore improving Medicare in its current form. Currently, many seniors struggle to afford the prescriptions medicines they need. That is why when I am elected to Congress I plan on working to create legislation that will allow the federal government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to bring down the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare recipients. I also intend to introduce legislation to change the asset and income tests for getting help with Medicare premiums and copays so that the seniors who are most in need are not forced to choose between their health and feeding themselves.Expanding universal health coverage to all Americans would give us all the peace of mind to know that getting sick will not lead to bankruptcy. We will no longer have to choose between a better job or better health care coverage. It my sincere belief that if we come together we can achieve this goal that has eluded us for too long and we can make a better America for all of us.Empowering and Respecting Tribal NationsIndian Tribes and Nations are sovereign governments that predate the formation of the United States. The United States Constitution through the Commerce, Treaty and Supremacy clauses recognizes the inherent sovereignty of tribes over their lands and citizens. Also, recognized is the direct relationship between Indian Tribes and the United States without State interference. As a member of Congress I will fight to empower tribal nations. This is our agenda for Indian Tribes and Nations:Support tribal sovereignty: Indian tribes must be able to exert civil and criminal jurisdiction over all who break tribal laws on tribal lands.Uphold the trust responsibility: The United States must honor its responsibilities under the treaties and statutes that form the trust relationship with Indian tribes.Encourage economic development: Diversified economic development must be supported to raise the standard of living of all Native Americans. Access to capital, markets and infrastructure are essential to growing tribal economies. Here in Florida’s 23rd Congressional district, the Seminole Tribe is the epitome of what can be done by Indian tribes to raise their standards of living through diversified economic development.Restore tribal lands: All Indian tribes must have the ability to place land into trust to restore native homelands. I will work to ensure that the Secretary of Interior can place land into trust for all tribes.Protecting sacred places: Native Americans must be empowered to maintain and pass on traditional religious beliefs, languages and social practices without fear of discrimination or suppression. Tribal cultures, sacred places, religious practices, and landscapes must be federally protected.Protect native children: Native children are the future of tribal nations; the Indian Child Welfare Act is critical to survival and must be enforced with the original intent of the law.Fight Climate Change and Promote Environmental Protection: Indian Country is at risk from environmental pollution of the air, water, and land, as well as from the effects of climate change, including rising sea levels. We must address climate change in a comprehensive and systematic way. Curbing Gun Violence in AmericaWhether the setting is a school, a church, a movie theater or a nightclub, the headline has become all too familiar: “Innocent Americans gunned down in a hail of bullets.” The statistics are alarming. From January 1, 2016, to June 22, 2016, there were 147 mass shootings in America where someone was killed or injured. In 2016 it is likely that more than 100,000 Americans will lose their lives or suffer violent injury because of firearms.Today in America – through either our negligence or willful inaction – we have created a culture of fear; the fear that anywhere and at any moment we can be the victim of senseless gun violence. I do not want to live in a culture of fear that threatens our freedom, our liberty or our happiness. That is why when I am elected to Congress I will make every effort to end this culture of fear while preserving the liberty for which our founder’s fought so dearly. I plan on introducing common sense proposals that are widely supported across our country, even by a great majority of members of the NRA , such as:Banning assault weapons;Requiring instant background checks, and closing background-check loopholes such as for gun shows;Prohibiting individuals on the terrorist watch list and from acquiring guns;Requiring that gun-owners notify the police when their guns are stolen;Prohibiting perpetrators of violent misdemeanors, those arrested for domestic violence and anyone under the age of 21, from qualifying for concealed carry permits, and requiring those who qualify for a concealed carry permit to successfully complete a safety training course;Requiring criminal background checks on gun owners and gun shop/gun show employees;Requiring reasonable liability insurance for gun owners.I have no doubt that this legislative agenda will be very challenging. At the same time, therefore, I will support proposals that can be implemented through executive orders, such as prohibiting the federal government from doing business with firms that produce or distribute assault rifles for civilian use.I am not an enemy of guns, I am an enemy of guns in the wrong hands.If we organize ourselves and work to enact each of these proposed measures, or succeed with even just one of them, America will be safer place for everyone.JOIN THE REVOLUTIONZIPTIM_CANOVART @GunnelsWarren : Sen.

http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2014/jul/18/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-obama-didnt-respond-his-warning-ab/	Says the Obama administration never responded to his 2012 letter flagging the uptick in unaccompanied children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.	mostly true	['Immigration']	http://www.politifact.com/	http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2014/jun/18/rick-perry/rick-perry-correct-record-number-immigrants-not-me/	2014/07/18	"A record number of immigrants not from Mexico are ""being apprehended at the border.""— Rick Perry on Tuesday, June 17th, 2014 in an interview on Fox & FriendsRick Perry correct that record number of immigrants not from Mexico are being apprehended at borderBy W. Gardner Selby on Wednesday, June 18th, 2014 at 5:16 p.m.Post by Fox & Friends .Gov. Rick Perry said apprehensions of immigrants not from Mexico are at an all-time high crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in this interview (Fox & Friends Facebook post, June 17, 2014).Questioning the flow of unaccompanied Central American children across the Texas-Mexico border, Gov. Rick Perry declared he has yet to hear from President Barack Obama or his administration to a 2012 letter urging attention to the matter.Perry went on to say on ""Fox & Friends"" June 17, 2014: ""We have record-high numbers of ‘other than Mexicans’ being apprehended at the border. These are people that are coming from states like Syria that have substantial connections to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations.""Both of those claims drew our interest, though for this story, we’re tackling only Perry’s statement that a record number of immigrants not from Mexico are being apprehended at the border. We’ll check his reference to people coming from ""states like Syria"" in another article.The increased flow of children from Central American nations has attracted attention, in part, Douglas Massey, a Princeton University professor, suggested this month , because fewer Mexicans are being detained near the border than any year since 1971. An online U.S. Border Patrol chart shows about 265,000 Mexicans were caught near the border in the fiscal year that ran through September 2013. That was up 3,000 from the year before, according to the chart, but down at least 15,000 compared to any of the previous dozen years.News reports suggest multiple factors in this surge including a contrast: The Border Patrol routinely and quickly returns immigrants from Mexico across the Rio Grande; that's not an option for handling individuals from distant countries like El Salvador and Honduras.So, have non-Mexican detentions at the border reached a record level?To our inquiry, Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed said Perry drew his conclusion about a record being set from information provided by the Texas Department of Public Safety.We turned to the Border Patrol for numbers. The federal agency posted an online chart indicating its officers apprehended 153,055 people from countries ""other than Mexico"" in the fiscal year that ran through September 2013. That’s more than in any of the seven previous years. That chart shows, though, that 165,170 ""other than Mexicans"" were apprehended in fiscal 2005.The numbers include all Border Patrol regions, including the northern border with Canada and coastal boundaries. Every year, though, the vast majority of such apprehensions occur in the agency’s Southwest Border region, running from San Diego to the tip of Texas.And what about the South Texas portions of the border that have received attention recently?The chart shows nearly 115,000 apprehensions from countries other than Mexico in the agency’s Laredo and Rio Grande Valley sectors in fiscal 2013, which outpaced the previous high of 100,647 in fiscal 2005.Tighter focus: The 96,829 ""other than Mexico"" apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley sector in 2013 was 21 percent greater than the sector’s previous high (at least since fiscal 2000) of 79,854 such apprehensions in 2005.By telephone, a Del Rio-based Border Patrol spokesman, Dennis Smith, brought us up to speed on ""other than Mexico"" apprehensions from October 2013 through May 2014, or the first eight months of fiscal 2014. In that period, he said, there were 165,729 such apprehensions nationally, including 162,749 in the Southwest region, counting what would be a 15-year high of 122,071 (and counting) in the Rio Grande Valley sector.Separately, analyst Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies , a think tank focused on reduced immigration, emailed us its chart demonstrating a surge since early 2011 in ""other than Mexico"" apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley sector: We asked Smith if for history’s sake, we should try to gauge apprehensions before 2000, the earliest year on the Border Patrol’s chart. Smith said there weren’t more such apprehensions any year before 2000. Our own brief look for older data led us to a Sept. 22, 2005, report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service indicating fewer people from countries other than Mexico were apprehended in 1997, 1998 and 1999.Finally: The number of unaccompanied children being picked up also has been record-setting, according to a June 4, 2014, New York Times news story. ""Since Oct. 1, a record 47,017 unaccompanied children have been apprehended at the southwest United States border,"" the story said, ""most traveling from Central America, part of a larger wave that includes some youngsters accompanied by their parents and some traveling alone.""The story said that according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection , that 47,017 total is ""nearly twice as high as all of the last fiscal year (24,493 apprehensions), with four months yet to go in the current fiscal year.""And, a June 5, 2014, Times news story said, an internal draft Homeland Security document projects unaccompanied-minor apprehensions rising to 90,000 in the current fiscal year, running through September 2014. Peter Boogaard, a Homeland Security spokesman, told the paper the draft document was not official policy and had not been finalized or circulated.Our rulingPerry said a record number of immigrants not from Mexico are ""being apprehended at the border.""We didn’t come up with apprehension figures for every year through history. But available figures show the Border Patrol apprehended more people from countries other than Mexico along the border through the first eight months of fiscal 2014 than it apprehended in any of the preceding 17 years.We rate Perry's statement as True.TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.Advertisement"
http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/aug/19/united-care/medical-grade-marijuana-wont-get-you-high-cannabis/	"""Medical-grade marijuana alone will not get that patient ‘high,’ no matter what level of THC, CBD or any other compound is found in the plant."""	mostly false	['Marijuana', 'Public Health']	http://www.sfltimes.com/	http://www.sfltimes.com/news/politics/local-politics/amendment-2-supports-healthcare	2016/08/19	Staff Report — August 11, 2016By KIM MCCRAYOur Health Matters. And when you vote for Amendment 2, not only are you voting for a medication that is proven to help people with cancer, HIV & AIDS, glaucoma, PTSD, MS and more, but you’re also voting for positive change in the community.Now, the opponents of Amendment 2 have taken on a tone similar to Donald Trump…instilling fear through saturating the media with misinformation. For example, the opponents to this amendment have touted that states like Colorado (who successfully passed a similar bill) have experienced a higher use of marijuana among 10th graders.But if you look at studies from noteworthy organizations such as the International Journal of Drug Policy, Colorado Department of Public Safety and Lancet Psychiatry to see the difference between adolescent use before and after passing a medical marijuana law, the level of misuse for that demographic went down. Therefore I would strongly encourage you not to get caught up by those types of scare tactics while considering the many benefits that passing this bill will bring to people you deeply care about.What is also important to know is that although some debilitated patients may require higher levels of THC than others based on their specific medical condition, medical-grade marijuana alone, will not get that patient“high,” no matter what level of THC, CBD or any other compound is found in the plant. And unlike the rumors floating around, medical-grade marijuana does not have to be smoked to be effective. It also comes in various other forms such as an ointment, oil, pill and skin patch.I’m reminded of Bridgette Wilkie from Orlando. Bridgette is a mother, wife and entrepreneur. She suffers from sickle cell anemia and lives with chronic pain that most people cannot imagine. Bridgette is taking “elephant doses” of Oxycontin and Oxycodone and still, there are days when she cannot get out of bed to see her daughter off to school because the pain is just too unbearable.The narcotics that are prescribed for Bridgette have terrible side effects on her organs that make her overall condition worse.It would be great if she could have access to other effective and safer alternative treatments like medical-grade marijuana, without making her high. Doctors should not be restricted from utilizing other safer and well-proven treatment methods when patients like Bridgette have such painful reactions to the narcotics typically prescribed for people in her condition.As you may know, current state regulations in Florida do not necessarily prevent doctors from prescribing (or over-prescribing) other drugs such as Morphine, Xanax, Oxycontin and other potentially deadly medications that are much more likely to be habit-forming. By supporting Amendment 2, you will help to ensure the right level of oversight in how medical-grade marijuana will be prescribed and distributed. In fact, one of the key provisions of this amendment is that only licensed physicians can recommend medical-grade marijuana and will be held accountable if they are found to be negligent.Think about the people in your life, your church or community who will begin to finally find comfort and relief when Amendment 2 passes. Furthermore,history shows that when a state enacts a medical marijuana law, first-time (and ongoing) use among teens in that state goes down.So when we go to the ballot box, we need to vote “YES” to prevent Florida politics from over-reaching at the expense of people like Bridgette (or our veterans, cancer patients, those suffering from AIDS and others) who could benefit greatly from a safer, more effective and more controlled medical alternative.Kim McCray is the Outreach Director for United For Care.

We sit here in the great battleground state of Ohio. 63 days to go. How badly do you need to win Ohio to win that White House?TRUMP: Well we’re up in Ohio and you see the kind of crowds we’re having in Ohio and I think we’re going to win it and certainly I think it will be very important to win Ohio. We’re going to do very well in Pennsylvania. We’re leading in Florida. We’re doing well pretty much all over but winning Ohio. First of all, I worked here for a long period of time and I loved this state and I love the people and I think we’re going to win Ohio.MUIR: You’ve heard what people have said. Republicans do not win the White House without Ohio.TRUMP: Well I’ve heard that and certainly we intend to win Ohio. We should win Ohio.MUIR: Twenty days until the first big debate. Are you ready?TRUMP: You never know, but I think so.MUIR: Are you prepping?TRUMP: Yeah sure. I’m prepping, maybe not in the traditional way. When I had the debates, I had 11 debates with the -- as you know -- in the primaries, and I was very satisfied. Everybody else was very satisfied with the way I did. And I think I’m working the same way I did there.MUIR: But this will be a lot different. I mean there will be two candidates on that stage. It won’t be, you know, the list that was there during the primary.TRUMP: Well we started off with 17 and in the end we had just a few left so, it’s not that much different. But I look forward to the debates. I think it’s gonna be very revealing.MUIR: Any mock debates?TRUMP: Haven’t thought about it much. It could happen. But haven’t really given it much thought.MUIR: I read somewhere that when you were asked about the debate. You were asked about the debates and you said, ‘I know how to handle Hillary.’TRUMP: I don’t think I’d ever say that about anybody. I don’t know how to handle you. I don’t know how to handle anybody. I’m me. I just do what I have to do. And what we’re going to be doing -- and you see it from outside when you look at those Ohio crowds we have 60 or 70,000 people right outside the door. That’s, nobody’s ever had that and what I know how to do is create jobs and that’s what I'm going to do.I’m bringing jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania and all of the states and they know my stance on immigration and it’s the proper stance. But we’re going to bring jobs back. We’re gonna give jobs back in these states because we are being drained, our country’s being drained of its jobs. And we can’t have that. I see people today, they want hope, they’re desperate, they’re desperate. We had 15,000 people working in a factory and now they’re down to 500 people. From 15,000 they’re down to 500 and the jobs have all left and the companies have gone to Mexico and other places. We’re not going to stand for that.MUIR: We couldn’t help but to notice that the Trump Pence plane is at the airport and so is Hillary Clinton’s new plane. Does that signal to you that it’s game on?PENCE: Well I think it’s been game on with Donald Trump since the very beginning and that’s the reason why everyday he’s been winning more hearts and minds all across this country with a simple message that we can make America great again. I mean you saw thousands of people out at this county fair today. And they’re responding to a strong leader but even beyond that he’d be the first to say this is a movement of people that know that the leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton has weakened America’s place in the world, stifled America’s economy and Donald Trump has the qualities of leadership and he has the vision to strengthen America at home and abroad.MUIR: Let me ask you Mr. Trump you just traveled to Mexico and you said shortly after that you and the Mexican president did not discuss who would pay for the wall. And then afterward the president of Mexico said it was discussed and that he said Mexico will not pay for it. Hillary Clinton, who’s also here in Ohio, as you know, told us a short time ago that you choked, that the idea of Mexico paying for this wall has been central to your campaign. Did you choke?TRUMP: So let me just tell you about choking. I don’t choke. She chokes. Look at the deals she’s made. She’s responsible for so many bad things that have happened to our country including the signing by her husband of NAFTA, which has drained our country of its jobs. I’ve been given A plus, including by you people, but I’ve been given A pluses for the job I did in Mexico. All that is is a Madison Avenue soundbite. Whether I did phenomenally or not they would have said that. That was a tremendous success for me. You know that virtually everybody including my biggest critics have said that when I went down to Mexico it was a tremendous success. Mike called me and said, ‘I’ve never seen anybody look so presidential.’ Many people have said that.PENCE: It’s true.TRUMP: And the fact is Mexico will pay for the wall, it was discussed that it wouldn't be discussed but they know my stance and I know their stance. And until I’m president I’m not going to press anything very much, but they fully know my stance. My stance is we’re going to build a wall and Mexico’s going to pay for the wall. It’s very simple.MUIR: Did the Mexican president break his word in talking about it?TRUMP: They all know the ground rules and the ground rules were there. Rudy Giuliani said it, in fact Rudy was surprised. Rudy Giuliani spoke very eloquently about it. The ground rules. And we had ground rules and that’s OK. They know my stance and I know their stance. See who wins in the end. We’ll win, 100 percent, they’re going to pay for the wall.We’re going to build a wall, they’re going to pay for the wall, we’re going to keep drugs out, we’re going to keep the people that-- we have gangs, we have gang leaders. We have drug kings. We have all of these people flowing into our country, all of those people are going to get out. We’re gonna get ‘em out. We’re gonna stop the flow of drugs into our country.Our country is being poisoned. Our youth are being destroyed. We have cities over the weekend 20 people are overdosed on drugs. Twenty people from one city and dying. They’re dying all over our country and it’s coming, mostly, from that section of the world. We’re gonna stop it.PENCE: Other than Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine, Donald Trump’s visit to Mexico City was universally praised. You remember that Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine have basically tried to paint a picture of Donald Trump that, just because you’re a strong leader at home and you have a strong vision about America’s place in the world that you don’t have the ability to sit down in a diplomatic setting and build relationships with world leaders. Last Wednesday what the American people saw, and frankly, what the world saw, was a gracious man who will represent America great on a world stage, but also will do it in a way that will command the respect of the world.MUIR: Governor, you know what the Clinton team will say though. That Mr. Trump is talking often about Mexico paying for that wall and that this campaign returned with Mexico saying, ‘we’re not paying for it.’PENCE: You know what you have in Donald Trump is not-TRUMP: Oh, he didn’t say that. He tweeted that long after the meeting was over. He didn’t say that.MUIR: You tweet a lot too though.TRUMP: I doMUIR: And we take you at your word.TRUMP: You have 25 million people with Facebook, why wouldn’t I take advantage of something. But the fact is he didn’t say that, he tweeted that after I left and then in the speech I made in Arizona -- which was also a really respected speech on immigration -- I said, ‘And by the way, Mexico will pay for the wall.’ I also said they might not even know it yet. But Mexico will pay for the wall, 100 percent and it’s easy because they’re making so much money. They’re taking our jobs. Drugs are pouring across the border. They make a fortune off the United States. Both at the border and with jobs.And I like them very much, I get along very well with the president. Very, very well. I think we’ll have a very good relationship, but Mexico will pay for the wall.MUIR: You talk about the speech. The central premise of the speech was immigration and let me just ask you about what one of your top surrogates, in the last 24 hours, Rudy Giuliani said that Donald Trump would ‘find it very difficult to throw a family that's been here in the United States for 15 years with kids who are now American citizens out of this country.’ That that’s not the America that Donald Trump wants. So will some of these families be allowed to stay?TRUMP: First of all he’s 100 percent right. It’s very difficult. It’s a very difficult thing to do. Here’s what we’re going to do. It’s very simple. It was put out in the speech and most people understood it but the crowd -- we had 15,000 people and they’re going wild and a lot of people I guess didn’t hear it or they just were watching the reaction. What we’re going to do is we’re going to build a tremendously strong and powerful boarder. People are going to come in, but they’re going to come in legally. We’re going to get rid of all of the bads: the gang members, the drug lords and all of the different people that are here and that shouldn’t be here. We’re gonna clean things up.Once we have a secure border -- totally secure -- we’re going to take a look at the people that you’re talking about. We're going to look at it from where our country is, from where we stand in the world, from how we’re doing as a country. We’re going to take a very good, strong, hard look at the people that remained.MUIR: When you take a good, strong hard look, does that mean some of those 11 million undocumented immigrants will be allowed to stay?TRUMP: It could be, but what’s going to happen is, if you’re going to be a citizen, you’re going to leave and you're going to have to come back. We’re going to do something -- you know we have thousands and thousands of people waiting on line. It’s very, very unfair to put people ahead of the line. We have right now thousands -- they’ve been waiting ten years, David, to come into the country. It’s very unfair to take people and have them circumvent the line. We’re going to speed up the line because I want people to come into the country, but they have to do it through a legal process. Tthey have to do it legallyPENCE: David, what you’re hearing here is--MUIR: But people want to know the answer to this question. Those who are here who are undocumented who did not break the law, who are coming--TRUMP: Well they broke the law in coming into the country.MUIR: Right.TRUMP: Is that a correct statement?MUIR: If they want to be a citizen, they will have to go home?TRUMP: If they want to be a citizen, they have to go home, get on line. Now, the line will be much more efficient. Like everything with this government, the line is a disaster right now. People are waiting for many many years and people are-- the only people that come into this country are the people that pour in. They just pour in. and many of these people are now member of the gangs and they’re now selling drugs all over the country.A lot of people are on line. It’s very unfair to have them waiting for four years, for six years, for ten years and other people just walk into the country. We can’t do that, but we’re gonna have a very efficient process because we want people to come into the country. They have to go through the system.PENCE: David, what Donald Trump is calling for is a fundamental reform of our immigration system. In that speech in Arizona, he said that if people want to achieve citizenship, they have to go back in line, they have to leave the country but they won’t be operating under the same visa caps of the past.We’re gonna be working with the Congress a new commission that our new president will establish to revise and reform our immigration laws, but all with the load star on what’s in the best interest of the American people now and going forward. That, to me, was the most refreshing part of Donald Trump’s messageTRUMP: And at the time, because you're talking about building a wall, securing our border, getting all of the criminals out -- because we have perhaps millions of people who have records, criminals. We’re going to end sanctuary cities where they see people are protected. They’re swaddled, they’re protected. We can’t do that anymore. I look at the families who have been destroyed by illegal immigrants killing their daughters, their sons, their husband, their wives. We’re not gonna have that any more, David. We’re not going to have that. So we will see, at the end of the process, where we are as a country and what we'll do.MUIR: So when those families do ultimately go home, the ones who have no record who are here, once you get the wall and the criminals out of here, as you say. Is it self-deportation?TRUMP: No.MUIR: Or will you deport them?TRUMP: No.MURI: How does it work?TRUMP: They will-- If they want to become a citizen, they’ll go out and they’ll come back in through a process, but they have to get on line,MUIR: But what is that called? I mean, most people call it--TRUMP: They don’t call it anythingMUIR: Will they have to go--TRUMP: They don’t call it anything, OK? They don’t call it anything. They will get on line, they’ll go behind people that have been waiting for four, five years. By that time the line, I’m sure, will be much more efficient because we do things efficiently -- right now it’s a bureaucratic mess. It’s a total mess. You know a lot of people don’t come in legally because of the fact that people are just pouring across the border. That’s the way they come into the country, right. So they will get on line and they will come in through an efficient process if they want to become a citizen.MUIR: And if they don’t want to become a citizen?TRUMP: They have to make a determination what happens when the border is secureMUIR: So you’re open to them staying here undocumented?TRUMP: I’m going to make a decision, or somebody will. Whether it’s me or somebody else because, perhaps, depending on the time -- by that time we’ll have a secure border, we’ll have a wall. We will have stopped the drugs pouring into the country. I mean, you look at states like Ohio you look at states like Pennsylvania or New Hampshire, the biggest thing on their minds is drugs. I say, ‘What’s your biggest problem?’ It’s jobs and it’s drugs. We’re gonna stop the drugs and we’re gonna bring jobs back to our states. We’re going to bring jobs back to our country.PENCE: And Donald Trump has laid out a plan to end illegal immigration once and for all, which has a direct relationship to the struggling economy that we face. The fact is that, here in Ohio and all over the country, illegal immigration now, for more than a generation, has cost Americans jobs, it has suppressed wages and it’s had all the other affects that he’s talked about so clearly and openly across the country.I think what the American people are seeing is a leader that knows how to put first things first. Whether it be in a meeting in Mexico City with the president where they focused on first building a relationship, talking about the five things they agreed on: ending illegal immigration, human trafficking, ending the flow of illicit drugs and other issues. And also in this area, what people heard from Arizona last week was Donald Trump saying we’re going to put border security and internal enforcement and removing criminal aliens and those who have overstayed their visas, we’re going to deal with all of that, and for those that remain we’ll have that discussion in the future.TRUMP: David, we have to stop the illegal flow of drugs into our country. Our country is a disaster, our youth is being poisoned, and I’m not talking about small numbers, I’m talking about massive numbers of young people whose lives are going to be destroyed and are destroyed in many cases because they’re hooked and they can’t get off it. Heroin, in particular, is so hard to get off, they’re hooked.We are going to stop the illegal flow of drugs and, as you know, 16,500 border patrol agents endorsed me. They know better than anybody what’s happening. They endorsed me. I said to them, ‘How important is the wall?’ They said, ‘Mr. Trump, it is absolutely imperative, especially for the stopping of the drugs that are pouring in.’MUIR: I do want to ask one more question on something you said a moment ago about people who are undocumented. You are open to the possibility that ultimately they might simply stay?TRUMP: We’re going to make that determination at the time. Once we have a secure border and we stop the drugs and stop the bad ones and get the bad ones out, those are going to be gone immediately. Day one, first hour, I”m going to give a mandate to everybody, including the local police because they know. You know the local police know every one of the bad ones, it’s not like, ‘Oh gee, let’s figure out who it is.’ They know every bad gang member, drug kingpin, they know all of them. As soon as I will be in office for one hour and that order will go out. We’re getting them the hell out of the country.PENCE: But David, let me also say it’s very appropriate to have lots of interest in what a President Donald Trump will do on illegal immigration. Donald Trump put the issue of illegal immigration at the center of the national debate. But what I’d also like to see, and I think millions of Americans would like to see, is more clarity about HIllary Clinton’s plan.Hillary Clinton is presumably for open borders. She intends to impose the unconstitutional executive amnesty that the supreme court rejected. I mean, she actually wants to increase the Syrian refugee program by 550 percent. I think as much attention that’s being paid to my running mate and our position on illegal immigration, the American people deserve to know that Hillary Clinton will advocate the policies of amnesty that the American people want to reject and it will continue the flow of illegal immigration that’s costing jobs in this country and too often resulting in tragedy.MUIR: And when it comes to Syrian refugees you still--TRUMP: Over.MUIR: Done, right now?TRUMP: Done. No more. Done. We have no idea who they are, we have no idea are they ISIS-related, we have absolutely no clue. And you see what happens with just one person. You take a look, all over the world, not just here, not just San Bernadino or Orlando, or any of the other places. You take a look at what one person does, the destruction that one person can do. And it is interesting with Hillary Clinton she wants to let the Syrian refugees, or whoever they are, pour into our country. We don’t even know where they’re putting them. You know the governors of states don’t even know who’s coming into their own states.MUIR: Have you met any of the Syrian refugees who live here now already in communities in California, Idaho?PENCE: David, that’s really not the issue. The issue is that we live in such uncertain times and what Donald Trump has put at the center of the national debate is there simply are countries, and even territories of the world, that are so torn asunder by civil war and so compromised by terrorism that our own homeland security and FBI director said we can’t know who these people are. So the only thing that a president of the United States should do is to suspend that program immediately, put the safety and security of the American people first and initiate safe zones in the region for those that are fleeing from those war torn areas.But secondly, Donald Trump is also calling for an extreme vetting to ensure that people who are coming into this country don’t represent a threat to ourselves and our families.TRUMP: Extreme vetting. Let me tell you, Hillary Clinton doesn’t talk about illegal immigration. It’s a very complex subject and it’s a subject that a lot of people don’t like to get into, even though everyone knows it’s a tremendous, massive problem and basically her definition of illegal immigrant is: come on in, folks, welcome to the country. She doesn’t get who they are, where they come from, what their record is. If they’re killers they’re killers. Doesn't make any difference to her. It’s open borders, it’s take everybody’s jobs, and it’s a disaster.And nobody can tell me that’s a popular thing, nobody can tell me it’s the right thing because it’s not the right thing. And you ever notice -- you’re talking to us about illegal immigration, which is fine with me -- but do you ever notice she never talks about it? She never brings it up. Because basically it’s an open border policy where people are going to flow into our country.MUIR: Let me ask you about something you said recently. You said that you have regretted moments along the way to your candidacy where your words have caused personal pain. And I’m curious, who are you talking about?TRUMP: Anybody.MUIR: Can you just give us one example?TRUMP: No, it’s no specifics, just anybody. Look--MUIR: Your campaign--TRUMP: I went through, David, I went through 16 people, we had 17. It was a very harsh, very harsh primary. People say the most in history. The most number of people, but it was the harshest in history. I was rough, they were rough on me, but you know a lot of feelings were hurt, some still, even though they signed a pledge. They haven’t been able to endorse me because they haven’t gotten over what took place. Number one, they lost, and number two, it was a tough primary.MUIR: So you were primarily talking about the other candidates?TRUMP: I’m talking about anybody that was offended or hurt. It’s OK. Now I have to go into the future, but I said that. And I mean it. I don’t want to hurt anybody, I don’t want to offend anybody. But if anybody was hurt. But, if you just look at the 16 people that I-- we had a total of 17 and I’m last standing.And now you see what’s happening with Hillary. You see what’s going on with her emails. It’s a disgrace. It’s a disgusting situation where she pretends like she doesn’t know. I mean, she had her emails -- 33,000 emails -- acid washed. The most sophisticated person never heard about acid washing. Acid washing is a very expensive process and that’s to really get rid of them. Really, and these emails pertain to her wedding or her yoga classes? What’s gone on here is very serious, and I’ll be honest, I think that the FBI is having a very, very hard time. I don’t think they’ve ever been through a period where so many people are so disappointed in them.MUIR: Do you think the FBI failed on this?TRUMP: It’s not a question of thinking. You know what-- you cover it every night. What she did is a series of lies, gross negligence, carelessness. I mean, your document said carelessness. This is worse, this is gross negligence. They put a young man in prison, or they’re going to put him in prison, because he used the wrong Xerox machine on something. What’s going on is horrible.MUIR: So when the director recommended no criminal charges--TRUMP: I was shocked. Especially after he read, for a fairly long period of time, just a few of the many things that she did that were illegal.MUIR: So is that a failure of the FBI?TRUMP: Well it’s certainly not a moment to be proud of, I can tell you that. I can tell you that I have so many people, both legal experts and civilians, regular people that cannot believe-- you see it outside. You see the people outside, how angry.Now I just heard that we have close to 100,000 people standing outside. They’re all for Trump. We’re in Ohio. They’re all for Trump. And you see the Hillary signs with bars on them. Look what she did is illegal. Now were the laws wrong, maybe they’re very tough, but a lot of people’s lives were ruined for doing two percent of what she did. Two percent.You look at General Petraeus. You look at this young person whose mother is absolutely devastated because they’re going to put her son in prison and what he did is nothing compared to what she did. It’s a horrible thing. It’s a horrible, horrible thing. And our country is not very proud right now, I can tell you.MUIR: Governor Pence, you’re making news this week in revealing that you’ll release your tax returns.PENCE: Sure. Will be a pretty quick read.MUIR: Pretty quick read. I’m curious, do you think the American voter has the right to see the tax returns of Donald Trump before they vote on election day?PENCE: You know I’m very pleased to provide our tax returns. You’re going to find out my family’s a middle class family and that there will be pretty clear evidence that we haven’t profited from our 16 years in and around public life.MUIR: Governor, I’m asking about Donald Trump and every presidential candidate going back four years--PENCE: Look I’m releasing my tax returns. Donald Trump will release his tax returns. I’ll give mine to y’all this week and he’s going to provide his after a routine audit is done.But it’s important for your viewers to know that both of us have filed what the law requires in the form of financial disclosure statements and I have to tell you, Donald Trump filed over a 100 pages of personal financial information. People have an opportunity to review that. But I do think an awful lot of this is a bit of a distraction. I actually was asked over the weekend on another network, making some comparison between the fact that Hillary Clinton made efforts to delete 17,500 emails and refused to turn those over to the FBI and authorities, with whether or not we had, in fact, yet released our tax returns. I just think that’s an absurd comparison, to say the least.Both of us believe in the the public’s right to know. We’ve both been transparent, as the laws require and will continue to be. But the simple fact is that Hillary Clinton needs to step forward. Donald Trump has had more press conferences in Mexico this year than Hillary Clinton has in the United States. It's time for her to come forward, start answering questions, start coming clean about what was nothing short of a pay-to-play program when major foreign donors were able to give millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. And now we know from these emails -- that she refused to turn over, that now have come to light -- that those individuals were given access, and who knows what else, at the state department while she was secretary of state.MUIR: Let me ask you, Governor, because you said something a moment ago You think the talk about Donald Trump and his taxes, and whether or not he’ll release his returns before Election Day, you think that's a distraction?PENCE: I think-- I have never seen, in my lifetime in and around politics, the level of media attacks on a public figure, the likes of which I’ve seen on my running mate.MUIR: I guess I’m asking-- you think people ought to have the right to see--PENCE: You have a level of dishonesty, you have a level of dishonesty in the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton, while she was secretary of state, the likes of which the American people have never seen. The FBI released their notes from their interview on a Friday afternoon before Labor Day weekend. But fortunately, still the press covered it very thoroughly. And we found out that she actually made classified information available through her private server that could have been hacked and exposed by enemies of this county. That had sensitive information, including information about drone strikes.The real scandal is that we’re finding out more and more every day that Hillary Clinton, while she was secretary of state, and her husband, were operating a foundation that allowed foreign donors to contribute millions of dollars that wouldn’t otherwise be able to contribute to American politics. And, you know, this wasn't unknown.When Indiana Senator Richard Luger was questioning Secretary of State Clinton during her confirmation hearings, he warned her about the potential that foreign individuals would try to take advantage of the Clinton Foundation. I’m told that President Obama and his team actually asked her create a firewall, and now more emails that come out -- David, I just have to tell you, we’ll release all the information on our tax records, Donald Trump will release his tax returns when his audit is done -- but I believe this is all a distraction by many in the media who simple don’t want to focus on this widening scandal around the Clinton Foundation and this pay-to-play program that happened during Hillary Clinton’s years as secretary of state.MUIR: I do want to let you both know that we pressed her on the Clinton Foundation before we sat down with the two of you.TRUMP: That’s fine. But, by the way, the FBI interviewed her during a major holiday, maybe it was the Fourth of July. Nobody ever heard of a thing like that. Then they released her papers late just prior to Labor Day weekend where people were away and not watching you show as much et cetera, et cetera. You need to say, what’s going on?Now, as far as my taxes are concerned, the only one that cares is the press, I will tell you. And even the press, I tell you, it’s not a big deal.MUIR: You don't think there are voters out there who--TRUMP: I don’t think so. I think people don't care. But for two reasons: Number one, I released the most extensive financial review of anybody in the history of politics. It’s either 100 or maybe more pages of names of companies, locations of companies, et cetera, et cetera, and it's a very impressive list and everybody says that. But I released a massive list, far more than you-- you don't learn much in a tax return.Number two, when this routine audit is done -- and I’ve been audited, I think, for 15 straight years -- when the audit is done, I’ll release them. I don't know when that's gonna be, it could be soon, it could be not. But every lawyer will tell you -- I was watching one of your competitors who happens to be a lawyer and said, well, nobody will release during what's called a routine audit. And that’s it. I don't think anybody cares, except some members of the press. I really don’t.MUIR: Tax returns do reveal how much someone has paid in taxes. And how much they've given in charitable giving.TRUMP: Well that's OK. But i've given a list on things that are given to charity. I have given that list. In fact, I made that list available. I’ve made a list available.MUIR: But you won’t reveal what you’ve paid in taxes unless the audit is done?TRUMP: When the audit is done, it will happen. I mean, I’ve gone through audits almost my whole adult life.MUIR: Before we head out into the crowd that’s waiting outside. We sit here in Ohio, very popular governor, John Kasich, you've stood on that debate stage against him. I’m curious, Governor Pence, do you believe that Mr. Trump is getting the support that’s expected for a Republican nominee from leaders of the Republican party. Is it adequate?PENCE: Well I think were earning more support each and every day.MUIR: But what about Governor Kasich here in Ohio?PENCE: Well we've been in contact with him. I hold Governor Kasich in high regard. Look, these two went through a tough competition together. I respect that, these things sometimes take time. But you know, I was in Utah just the other day with Governor Gary Herbert and Senator Orrin Hatch, I think we're seeing members of Congress, we’re seeing governors around the country coming alongside Donald Trump. But what gets me even more excited by a lot is the thousands of people at the county fair today. It's the thousands of people that turn out on very short notice for rallies for Donald Trump or with Donald Trump.I mean, this is a man who has spoken into the heart of the American people, who know we can do better. Who know that seven and a half years of the kind of leadership that Barack Obama, what Hillary Clinton will continue, has weakened America's place in the world, it’s stifled America’s economy, and walked away from the constitutional framework our founders enshrined. And the Supreme Court is an enormously important issue.With all due respect, David, as you’ve talked about a couple of issues in this interview, what I hear about, when I’m campaigning with Donald Trump or for Donald Trump are the security of the American people, the prosperity of the American people, the Supreme Court of the United States and ensuring that we have the highest standards of integrity in the highest office in the land and on every one of those issues Donald Trump is the clear choice.MUIR: And you’ll make that case on that debate stage?TRUMP: Well I think so and you know I'm disappointed that people signed a pledge -- and they signed it so I would sign it, just so you remember. The pledges were signed by everybody so that I would sign it because they didn’t want me to be out there as a free agent, so to speak. But I’m disappointed-- and most of them came through, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee, we have so much-- Chris Christie, I have so much support. People don’t talk about the support.MUIR: But as you sit here in Ohio, are you upset with Governor Kasich?TRUMP: I would say I’m disappointed because we are winning Ohio, we’re doing great nationally, as you understand. I mean, we’re doing very well, I think we’re going to win. I don’t think the American people are going to allow four more years of Barack Obama and that’s what they’ll get with Hillary Clinton except I think it’ll be even worse.MUIR: Thank you, Mr. Trump. Governor Pence. Thank you.TRUMP: Thank you."

No other state government can possibly have as many simultaneous sideshows going on as this one. Let's take a peek at what's happening under the big tent: • Gov. John Kasich's budget is toast. Republicans have 60 seats in the 99-member House and 23 of the 33 in the Senate. Yet the Republican governor and Republican legislative leaders can't find the votes to pass Kasich's budget. The spending plan that will pass in late June will be unrecognizable from the one the governor sent them in early February. Kasich wants to run for re-election next near armed with a 30-second television commercial that boasts of adding jobs and cutting taxes. So his only escape from this budget chaos is an end product that includes the sizable income tax cut he's been touting for three years. Anything less makes him look weak and ineffective. • Following a catastrophic 2012, the Tea Party's back, threatening to field candidates against the governor and Republican legislators next year. The Tea Party vehemently opposes Kasich's budget provision that would accept federal dollars to expand Ohio's Medicaid program. Neither is it wild about Kasich's idea to tax fracking, a form of drilling to pump out oil and natural gas. Callow GOP legislators apparently quiver at this opposition. But anyone intimidated by a group of losers who last year tanked in 12 of 16 U.S. Senate races and who contributed mightily to the Republican presidential candidate's crushing defeat doesn't belong in public office. • The Tea Party's ringmaster, i.e., shill, in Ohio seems to be state Treasurer Josh Mandel. First, Mandel sent a letter to legislators urging them to reject Kasich's Medicaid expansion. Then he reiterated his opposition to Kasich's fracking tax. This prompted a spokesman for the governor to imply that Mandel has become a shill for Big Oil. Mandel wants to run again for the Senate in 2018. At this point, that's almost laughable. He's well on his way toward destroying a once-promising career. • With his budget on the ropes, Kasich desperately needs leadership from House Speaker Bill Batchelder and Senate President Keith Faber. Here's what leadership doesn't look like: On Dec. 19, Batchelder said of Kasich's proposed fracking tax, ""I don't think there's any question we will support it."" On March 7, he told members of the Ohio Oil and Gas Association the governor's idea is""a big mistake"" and ""we're not going to be doing the kind of things to damage an industry that are among the proposals that have been made."" Imposing a tiny tax on people who want to suck billions of dollars worth of oil and gas from the ground makes sense. And anyone who claims the tax would drive businesses from the state is lying. • What's happening with the budget is embarrassing to Kasich. But it's his dispute with yet another Republican (anyone else notice a pattern here?) that has the potential to inflict lasting damage. State Auditor Dave Yost wants to review the financial records of JobsOhio, an economic development entity established by Kasich and the legislature that's designed to be free of the public scrutiny traditionally required of public agencies. When Kasich balked, Yost subpoenaed the records. As Tuesday's deadline for complying with Yost's subpoena nears, talks aimed at a compromise are under way. But a governor has enormous power. And Yost is feeling it. ""The pressure is tremendous,"" he said Tuesday, during an interview in his office across the street from the Statehouse. ""I've got people in the legislature threatening to bar the authority of this office. . . . And we've got the Capitol Square crowd explaining to me how unhelpful this all is."" But Yost seems to sense that an all-out retreat would permanently scar his reputation. ""The means are always open to discussion in any situation,"" he said. ""The ends are not. Here, the end is transparency sufficient to support a confidence the quasi-private money is being properly controlled and spent and that the actions of JobsOhio are ethical."" If Kasich and Yost can't cut a deal, the dispute heads to court. But the court of public opinion has already ruled in this case. And everyone in town knows the governor lost it. Columbus -- The circus comes to town May 8. But whatever acts Ringling Bros. brings to Value City Arena for its weeklong engagement here won't hold a candle to what's going on around Capitol Square.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Happening now: new skepticism about the U.S. economy and whether the president's policies are really helping -- a top White House official now acknowledging that the stimulus won't necessarily do all that much good down the road. Stand by for details. Dick Cheney says President Obama seems afraid to make a decision -- this hour, the former vice president on the war this Afghanistan and his claim that the White House, including the president, the White House is now dithering. And soda drinkers in New York State face the threat of paying what's being called a fat tax. The governor's controversial proposal to pay for health care makes a comeback. I'm Wolf Blitzer in CNN's command center for breaking news, politics and extraordinary reports from around the world. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. President Obama says American values are offended when bailed-out companies write fat checks for their executives. He spoke at a -- the White House just a little while ago. The Treasury Department is moving forward with a plan to order pay cuts at seven big firms surviving on taxpayer money. Let's go right to our White House correspondent, Dan Lothian. He's working the story for us. All right, Dan, explain what happened today. DAN LOTHIAN, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, first of all, Wolf, you know, President Obama has always talked about how excessive risk-taking that led to the collapse, the financial collapse, should not be rewarded. So, what you saw today in this announcement is really in response to that and also to public outrage. So, Mr. Feinberg, Kenneth Feinberg, has now wrapped up his review, and the Treasury Department will be imposing these cuts on these seven companies. Twenty-five top executives at these seven companies will see their cash pay cut by 90 percent. Now, this will begin in November and go through the end of the year. So, we're talking about November and December. And then there will be a lower base salary put into play in 2010. Also, overall compensation will be cut by 50 percent. One other thing: They will see their perks limited, such as getting some of these country club fees back or using private jets for personal travel. Now, Mr. Obama at the White House today praised the Treasury Department, and in particular Mr. Feinberg, for striking a balance between protecting the -- the American taxpayers and also trying to fix the financial system. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I have always believed that our system of free enterprise works best when it rewards hard work. This is America. We don't disparage wealth, we don't begrudge anybody for doing well, we believe in success. But it does offend our values when executives of big financial firms -- firms that are struggling -- pay themselves huge bonuses even as they continue to rely on taxpayer assistance to stay afloat. (END VIDEO CLIP) LOTHIAN: President Obama says that much more needs to be done. And he called on Congress to pass some kind of legislation that will give stockholders more of a say in the compensation of these executives, Wolf. BLITZER: Dan, stand by for a moment. I want to get right back to you. There's another move in the works here in Washington to crack down on pay policies that contributed to the financial crisis. For the first time, the Federal Reserve is now proposing that it police executive compensation at thousands of banks, including many that never got a bailout. The Fed wouldn't set pay, but it could veto pay policies that seem too risky or too reckless. Let's bring back our senior political analyst, Gloria Borger, and Dan Lothian to discuss what's going on. Gloria, some will start complaining that the federal government is weighing in way too heavily right now on private enterprise, if you will, on the free market system. GLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Sure, they will. That's -- that's inevitable. But what the Fed is really trying to do today is to make sure that the banks don't encourage their bankers to have another meltdown, such as the one that we saw before. They want to encourage pay packages that say to bankers, look at the long term. Don't make reckless investments that you can profit from in the short term, but consider the long-term future of your banks. So, they're going to be looking at these pay packages. They're not going to set caps, Wolf, on salaries. So, there will be plenty of people making multimillions of dollars. But they are going to take a look at executive compensation and say, it cannot be geared towards the kind of short-term gain that brought us the meltdown in the first place. BLITZER: Dan Lothian, listen to this exchange that Jessica Yellin just had with Ken Feinberg over at the Treasury Department. He was announcing these pay caps on these seven bailout firms. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JESSICA YELLIN, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Some of these companies, when they accepted the bailout, did not know that their salary, their executive salaries, would be capped. Is it un-American for the government to tell companies what they can pay employees? KENNETH FEINBERG, WHITE HOUSE PAY CZAR: It's not a good idea for -- for the United States government to start micromanaging compensation practices at American businesses. But that's not this case. These are, under the statute, seven specific companies that are, in effect, owned by the taxpayers of the United States. (END VIDEO CLIP) BLITZER: So, you hear, Dan, he's making quite a distinction between the bailed-out companies to the tunes of tens or -- or hundreds of billions of dollars, as opposed to all the other companies that won't be directly impacted by these rules. LOTHIAN: That's right, because companies, Wolf, that did not receive any of this bailout money will not have these restrictions. They can still pay their -- their executives whatever they want. And, you know, what the White House will point out again is, if any of these executives are not happy about this pay cut, they have to realize that the reason they have a job is because taxpayers have really -- have already put up all of this money to keep these banks solvent. So, they can't really complain now that their pay is being cut, when they have a job because of taxpayers in the first place -- Wolf. BLITZER: Any political downside, Gloria, to the White House taking these steps? BORGER: Well, you know, sure there is, Wolf. I mean, there are going to be people who say, this is big government, that it's -- it's going to do just what Dan was talking about, which is discourage good executives, have them leave the business entirely. It's going to slow down the process of getting these banks out of the trouble that they're in right now. But, in the -- in the long term, Wolf, when you look at what the Fed is -- is -- is planning to do, it's -- it's trying to ensure that these kinds of problems don't happen again. BLITZER: Gloria Borger and Dan Lothian, guys, thanks very much. A top White House official now says the president's economic stimulus package has done about all it can to jolt the economy and generate jobs. The economic adviser at the White House, Christina Romer, offered that assessment to Congress today, amid very intense debate about whether a second stimulus is now need. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRISTINA ROMER, CHAIRWOMAN, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS: Most analysts predict that the fiscal stimulus will have its greatest impact on growth in the second and third quarters of 2009. And, by mid-2010, fiscal stimulus will likely be contributing little to further growth. (END VIDEO CLIP) BLITZER: That's a gloomy assessment right there. She has a lot more to say. And we're going to stay on top of this. The American people are sending some mixed messages about the economy right now and about the president's handling of the recession. Let's bring in our senior political correspondent, Candy Crowley. She's working this part of the story for us. The mixed messages clearly reflected, Candy, in our new public opinion poll. CANDY CROWLEY, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: They are, indeed. And you know, we -- we so often separate this country between the blue states and the red states or the South and the North, the -- either coast. And now we're looking at what is a new kind of divide. And that is the people who look at, say, Wall Street and some other indicators about what the economy is doing, and then there are the people that live this economy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (BELL RINGING) CROWLEY (voice-over): A week ago, Wall Street rang out a day above the 10000 mark. There are economic predictions the final quarters of this year will show economic growth. Chiming in now, without celebration, the American people -- for the first time since December, the percentage of Americans who describe the economy as very poor has gone up to 42 percent. On Main Street, forecasts of economic growth and Wall Street milestones do not speak as loudly as other figures. The jobless rate is still high. Some people are beginning to come to the end of their unemployment benefits. And small businesses continue to struggle. The unknown is also a powerful thing. Martin Bailey once served as chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. MARTIN BAILEY, FORMER CHAIRMAN, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS: What I think many people are sensing is a fear that this -- this recovery may not be as strong as the typical one, and, in fact, may be more like a jobless recovery. CROWLEY: Overall, the latest CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll shows 84 percent of Americans think the economy is either poor or very poor. In the glass-half-full column, more than two-thirds believe the worst is over and the economy has stabilized or is improving. BAILEY: The main thing that makes it better is that we have sort of taken the Great Depression off the table. CROWLEY: So far, the public's assessment of the economy does not seem to be taking much of a toll on the president's policies. OBAMA: There's no question that the steps we have taken have improved the overall climate for small business across the country, But there's also no question that we have got a long way to go. CROWLEY: In general, Americans seem to share that view. Fifty- six percent say the president's policies have or will improve the economy. In short, beyond Wall Street, outside the wonky world of economic predictors, most Americans believe the president has made things better, the worst is over, but increasing numbers say it is still very bad out there. (END VIDEOTAPE) CROWLEY: Changing those numbers, of course, is just a matter of the economy changing. But several economists I talked to today say there is one big problem and one worry they have when they look at these sorts of numbers. And that is, on an economy that is based so much on consumer spending, when you see how consumers are viewing the economy, what it means is, they won't spend. So, it becomes a sort of vicious cycle. Consumers need to spend in order for the economic recovery to take off. But, when they look and see that the recovery hasn't taken off, they don't spend. BLITZER: And the key... CROWLEY: So, that's what's worrisome here. BLITZER: The key indicator is the jobs. Are the jobs coming back? And Christina Romer, the White House economic adviser, today... CROWLEY: Right. BLITZER: ... said, probably throughout next year, all of 2010, the unemployment number will remain at around 9.5 percent. That's a lot of unemployed people. CROWLEY: It is. And that's -- that's a number that's so understandable across the board. And when you start talking to people about gross domestic product, you know, their -- their eyes glaze over. When you start talking about unemployment, immediately, you get it. BLITZER: Millions of people looking for work right now. And they're going to continue looking for work... CROWLEY: Yes. BLITZER: ... or at least for the foreseeable future. Thanks very much, Candy. CROWLEY: Sure. BLITZER: Dick Cheney says America's foreign policy is adrift right now. He's saving some of his toughest criticisms for the president's handling of the war in Afghanistan. Is Mr. Obama being deliberate, or is he dithering, as Dick Cheney argues? Plus, an openly gay man says he was attacked because of his sexual orientation. Should that be considered a hate crime? Dana Bash has the story. And they're trying to live the American dream, but there's a catch. Their parents came to this country illegally. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: Earthquake in Afghanistan. Let's get some details just coming into THE SITUATION ROOM right now. Fredricka Whitfield standing by. Fred, what do we know? FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So, Wolf, what we understand is an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.1 took place somewhere about 178 miles northeast of Kabul. Our own Pentagon correspondent, Chris Lawrence, is actually in the Kabul area. And he said that he actually felt it. So, it's quite the tremor being felt from this 6.1 earthquake. Apparently, it has shaken a lot of buildings, not just in Afghanistan, but in nearby Pakistan as well. We don't have any more information about what kind of damage that may have resulted, but this taking place just moments ago. This is the latest that we have about this pretty sizable earthquake being felt by many people, including our own there on assignment -- Wolf. BLITZER: Yes, as if they -- they didn't have enough problems in Afghanistan, now they have an earthquake they have to deal with as well. WHITFIELD: Right. BLITZER: Fred, we're going to get some more information and get back to you. Thank you. Here in Washington, the Senate is preparing a vote and send to the president a bill that would make anti-gay violence a hate crime. Our report contains some language that viewers may find offensive. Let's go to our senior congressional correspondent, Dana Bash. She's working the story on the Hill. There are some who oppose this legislation, a lot of people in favor of it, Dana. But set the scene for us. DANA BASH, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, in terms of those who oppose, many Republicans do. They say that it's not necessary to make it a federal offense to attack someone because they're gay. They also are very unhappy that Democrats have attached this hate -- hate crimes legislation to a must-pass defense bill. But, Wolf, Democrats admit they had to in order to get the votes to pass this. Now, this is named for Matthew Shepard. You remember him, of course. He was a young man tied to a fence and beaten to death about a decade ago. Well, we talked to somebody who was a victim of a hate crime who lived to tell his story and says this legislation is crucial. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BASH (voice-over): When Todd Metrokin came here for late-night pizza last summer, he offered a slice to some people sitting outside. TODD METROKIN, HATE CRIME VICTIM: I thought it was a nice exchange. And, as we were walking away, my friend mentioned, you know, that he said -- called me a faggot under his breath. BASH: As they walked through this Adams Morgan neighborhood in D.C., Metrokin didn't realize they were being followed, until they were suddenly attacked. METROKIN: The attack occurred right about here. They were calling us names, ""faggot."" BASH (on camera): What was the last thing you remember? METROKIN: I -- the last thing I remember was the first hit. BASH (voice-over): He woke up in the hospital looking like this, bruises and broken bones, even a shoe mark on his face. METROKIN: Somebody had to actually stomp on my face while I was on the ground to achieve that. And that's when it became just so crystal clear to me the kind of hate that requires someone to do that. BASH: Attacks like this will now be a federal offense under legislation expanding the hate crimes law, which now covers race, color and religion, to also include victims targeted because of their sexual orientation. SEN. PATRICK LEAHY (D-VT), JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Violence against members of any group because of who they are is not going to be tolerated in our country. BASH: Many Republicans object, arguing violent crimes are already illegal, and this creates what they call thought crime. SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: I do not believe an expansion of the federal criminal code is necessary to cover a certain class of citizens from -- quote -- ""perceived injustices."" BASH: But supporters note this would punish acts, not beliefs, and point to government figures showing crimes against gays and lesbians are on the rise, and say federal dollars, attention and penalties this new law will provide are needed. OBAMA: And I will sign it into law! (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) BASH: Politically, the White House hopes passing this long- fought priority in the gay community will ease frustration that President Obama is slow to act on their issues. (END VIDEOTAPE) BASH: Now, gay rights groups do plan to release statements praising the president and congressional Democrats for passing what they will call the first piece of civil rights legislation for lesbian and gay Americans. But, Wolf, privately, gay activists say that there is still some sufficient anger in the gay community because they do -- don't believe that the president is acting on other very big priorities fast enough. Those priorities are, of course, reversing don't ask, don't tell and also the Defense of Marriage Act -- Wolf. BLITZER: So, when do we expect final passage that will enable the president to sign this into law? BASH: Expect it either tonight or tomorrow. It's still up in the air. I think they're still negotiating that as we speak here in the Senate, but by the end of the week. That is certainly the plan. And expect a big signing ceremony sometime soon at the White House. BLITZER: Yes, within a matter of days, I'm sure. All right, Dana, thank you. Many are A students with big dreams for their future, but they're paying a price for decisions made by their parents. There are hundreds of thousands of undocumented students in the United States right now. CNN's Thelma Gutierrez is -- has our story for us. Thelma, I understand this young woman's parents came to the United States illegally, but she's a -- a brilliant student? THELMA GUTIERREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, Wolf. In fact, many of these students came to the United States as small children. They say the United States is the only country they have ever known. And they argue that they're not looking for a handout, just a path to legalization, so that they can use their degrees to give back to society. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: GPA of 4.2. (APPLAUSE) GUTIERREZ (voice-over): Michelle graduated with high honors from high school. She was on the school swim team... MICHELLE, USC STUDENT: The Latina festival is about to start. GUTIERREZ: ... and a student leader on campus. MICHELLE: I was accepted to nine schools. GUTIERREZ (on camera): Nine universities? MICHELLE: Yes. GUTIERREZ (voice-over): Including Duke, Cornell, Berkeley, and USC wanted Michelle. But she couldn't go because of a family secret. Michelle and her parents entered the United States illegally. ZAK TAY, MICHELLE'S HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER: They do have the potential to go to big universities, but there's no money. You know, and that does limit their dreams. GUTIERREZ: Michelle is one of some 2.5 million undocumented students. She can't apply for federal aid because of her immigration status. And she can't work legally either. (on camera): Do you ever worry that you will be arrested or deported, either you or your family? MICHELLE: That's definitely a fear that's hard to live with. GUTIERREZ (voice-over): Michelle says her parents brought her from Guatemala 10 years ago. Her teachers soon noticed Michelle was an academic star. (APPLAUSE) VERONICA BENNETT, MICHELLE'S HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER: She has a goal. She has a focus. And it's going to be dentistry. And she's going to get there in whatever way she can. GUTIERREZ: Immigrant rights groups are calling on Congress and President Obama to pass the federal DREAM Act, which would create a path to legalization for students like Michelle. LUPE MORENO, CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM: No. GUTIERREZ: The DREAM Act infuriates critics, like Lupe Moreno of the California Coalition For Immigration Reform. MORENO: Nobody has compassion for my children. I have no compassion for them. Let them -- let them go to their country and demand of their country what they're demanding of our country. GUTIERREZ: But Michelle's dream is still alive, thanks to a private full four-year scholarship from the University of Southern California, where she wants to study dentistry. MICHELLE: We want to be doctors, dentists, professionals that are going to impact the -- the world. And -- and the U.S. should feel proud to have these type of people here. (END VIDEOTAPE) GUTIERREZ: And there are 133 legislators in Washington right now who have signed on as co-sponsors of the federal DREAM Act. In fact, when the president was campaigning himself, he said that he would make the DREAM Act a priority. And the students are hoping that he hasn't forgotten -- Wolf. BLITZER: Thelma Gutierrez with a controversial story -- thanks, Thelma, very much for that. This note to our viewers: Tonight, ""Latino in America,"" CNN's groundbreaking look at how Latinos are changing America, continues, part two tonight. The special airs at 9:00 p.m. Eastern -- Eastern. It will also be simulcast in Spanish on CNN en Espanol. Coming up: Chris Lawrence. He's is in Kabul, where there's just been an earthquake. We're going to check in with him and to see what is going on, just what that country doesn't need right now. And, also, a massive crackdown on Mexican drug cartels -- what's going on? Hundreds of arrests made nationwide -- we have the details. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: A strong earthquake in Afghanistan also rattling parts of Pakistan. Chris Lawrence is on the scene for us in Kabul, where he's been reporting on the war. But, Chris, the last thing this country needs right now is an earthquake. I take it you felt it where you are? CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Wolf. It's -- it's almost 1:00 in the morning here. And this happened about 12:30 in the morning. I -- I had just gone to bed probably about an hour ago. And I woke up to just the shaking. You know, you -- we could feel pretty much the entire house that we're living in here in Kabul shaking. And I -- I lived out in California for a long time. So, I have -- I have been through a lot of earthquakes. And I know the last thing you want to do when -- when you're shaking and it's nighttime is to go stumbling around in the dark while the shaking is going on. So, you -- you know, I laid there and I waited and waited and waited. But the thing about this earthquake that I thought was so unusual was just the -- the length of time that the shaking went on. I have been through a lot of earthquakes where it lasts maybe less than 10 seconds, sometimes as little as like five seconds of shaking. This went on at least about 20 seconds, if -- if not longer than that. And it was pretty considerable shaking. We could definitely feel the house moving here. I'm told it was about a 6.1-magnitude quake. And the epicenter was somewhere in the Hindu Kush region. Probably the closest city to that area is a city called Faizabad. To give you some perspective of where that is, it's probably about 175 miles from -- from here in Kabul. And I'm told the -- the quake was -- the depth of the quake was about 103 miles deep. That, to me, says -- you know, that's not close. You know, to be about 175 miles away and for us to feel that amount of shaking for -- for that length of time was pretty unusual -- Wolf. BLITZER: And you're saying it happened around midnight your time there, in the middle of the night. So, we have -- I take it we have no reports yet of any injuries or deaths or damage. It's about 100 -- you say, 150 miles or so from Kabul, the capital? LAWRENCE: Yes. And the -- and the thing about that, Wolf, is, you know -- you know, when a quake like this happens out -- out West, on the West Coast of the U.S., you know, immediately, people start calling in or e-mailing and -- and calling in to police, and then get the helicopters out. And you start to get instant, instant accounts of what happened. You know, that doesn't happen here in Afghanistan, obviously. Another big difference is, out on the West Coast, where you get a lot of earthquakes there in the U.S., you know, most of the older buildings have been retrofitted, reinforced, and all the newer buildings have been built specifically up to a code to withstand earthquakes. I can guarantee you that's not the -- not the case here in Afghanistan. And, in a country that's, you know, very spread out, very rural, a lot of places with no paved roads, it -- it will be very difficult to -- to get an immediate assessment of what's happened, especially in the middle of the night. We will probably have to wait until daylight to start trying to talk to some authorities, and -- and people can get out and start looking around, and -- and try to make some contact with -- with folks around the country. BLITZER: And I'm sure the U.S. military and the NATO allies, the other troops, not necessarily expecting to have to get involved saving people's lives in an earthquake. But I'm sure they will do whatever they can in this kind of an emergency situation. We're going to get back to you, Chris. Thanks very much. Stand by. Chris Lawrence, our Pentagon correspondent, is in Kabul right now. Let's bring in the top Republican in the House of Representatives, the minority leader, John Boehner of Ohio, who's joining us. Mr. Leader, thanks very much for coming in. REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Wolf, it's good to be with you. BLITZER: Certainly an earthquake in Afghanistan. Given the enormous problems they already have, it's the last thing they need right now. But I'm sure the U.S. troops will do whatever they can to help in this kind of humanitarian emergency situation. Let's talk about Afghanistan for a moment. I also want to talk about some other issues. But what's wrong with the president of the United States, the commander-in-chief, spending some quality time with the military, the intelligence community, members of Congress, the top leadership, experts outside the government, and trying to figure out what to do now given the fact that if he deploys additional troops, you're putting a lot more young men and women in harm's way? BOEHNER: Well, Wolf, this is a difficult decision. And I told the president that himself when I was at the White House several weeks ago. But this deliberation has been going on since Labor Day. And my concern is that the troops that we have there today are in greater jeopardy as a result of the uncertainty that is being caused by the delay in this decision. And so I think there's enough information in the president's hands. And I do believe that the quicker he makes this decision, the quicker General McChrystal can get on with the task at hand and bring more safety to those troops who are on the ground today. BLITZER: Because, as you remember, and I certainly remember, when President Bush was deciding whether to send additional troops in for the so-called surge in Iraq, he was deliberating not just for weeks, but for months before he came up with that final decision as well. He wanted to make sure he had it right. And it seems, at least as of now, to be paying off somewhat, that surge in Iraq. So, isn't the president, the current president, doing what the former president did? BOEHNER: Well, listen, I understand the deliberations. I just think they've gone on awfully long. And secondly, the Hill's been asking for General McChrystal to come to the Hill and testify. This has been a bipartisan request in both chambers of the Congress, to have General McChrystal come up so members of Congress and the American people can understand the challenges we're facing in Afghanistan, and really understand the strategy that he's proposing. It has been unusual that the president has not allowed General McChrystal, our commander in the theater, to come and testify. BLITZER: Have you asked for General Petraeus? BOEHNER: We've asked... BLITZER: McChrystal's boss, the central commander. BOEHNER: We've asked for one or both. But at the end of the day, it's General McChrystal who's on the ground in Afghanistan. He's the one out in the villages talking to the troops every day. And it's his strategy that the president is considering. BLITZER: Let's talk a little bit about the economy right now. It's a sensitive subject. Christina Romer, the White House economic adviser, saying today that the economic stimulus package that the Congress passed without a whole lot of Republican support, she says has saved or created between 600,000 and 1.5 million jobs, which is a pretty good number if you think about 600,000 people or 1.5 million people. BOEHNER: Well, I don't know where these numbers come from. All I know is this -- the president said that if the stimulus bill were to pass, that unemployment would not exceed 8 percent. It's now nearly 10 percent. And secondly, three million Americans have lost their jobs since this bill was signed into law. And it's pretty clear that the bill is not working. And that's because it's all about a bunch of government spending and not enough about allowing money to stay in the hands of American families and small businesses. BLITZER: Well, she makes the point that instead of three million people losing their jobs, it would have been four million people potentially losing their jobs if there had been no economic stimulus package. Let me rephrase the question. Is it time for a new economic stimulus package? Because this one, at least according to Christina Romer, seems to have run its course and it's not necessarily going to do much in the next year. BOEHNER: Well, I'm really concerned about the talk about another stimulus bill. It sounds like more spending, more taxes and more debt. Exactly what the American people don't want. If we're serious about getting the economy going again, the president ought to consider some of the ideas that we sent to him and sent to speaker Pelosi outlining ways to allow the American people to keep more of what they earn. Because until the American people begin to start spending more and small businesses begin to start creating jobs, I don't think that we're going to get out of this. BLITZER: Let me ask you a very political question based on a story that was posted today at Politico.com by Jim VandeHei and Mike Allen. They write this -- and I'll read you the lead and then we'll get your reaction. ""Many top Republicans are growing worried that the party's chances for reversing its electoral routs of 2006 and 2008 are being wounded by the flamboyant rhetoric and angry tone of conservative activists and media personalities, according to interviews with GOP officials and operatives."" Are you among those GOP officials and operatives who are worried about some of the so-called flamboyant rhetoric that we're hearing against the Democrats and against the president? BOEHNER: Listen, Wolf, I think we're going to have a very good year next year. And Republicans have to do two things. We've got to continue to stand on principle here in Washington. And whether it's against some of the proposals like this health care proposal, or higher taxes, or more spending. But in addition to that, we have to be the party of better solutions. When I handed Nancy Pelosi the gavel in January, I said that if we had to oppose our new president, or oppose our Democratic colleagues in Congress, it was our obligation to say how we would do it better. And I thought we had a better solution on the stimulus plan, a better solution on the budget, a better solution on cap and trade, their national energy tax. And I think our ideas about making the current health care system work better are much better solutions than their big government-run health care plan. BLITZER: So, is the flamboyant rhetoric, the angry rhetoric, helping or hurting Republicans? BOEHNER: Listen, I know what I have to do here in the Congress. And I know what my colleagues have to do. We've got to continue to engage the American people, communicate with them about what's happening here in Washington, what the Democrat majority is doing, but what our better solutions are. And we're going to continue to do that. BLITZER: John Boehner is the top Republican in the House. Mr. Leader, thanks for coming in. BOEHNER: Wolf, good to be with you. BLITZER: Allegations of widespread fraud could threaten a program to help first-time homebuyers. And graphic accounts of the deadly D.C. Metro train crash. A new documentary takes all of us where only one -- the only first responders at the time were allowed to go. And how commercial airline pilots managed to fly more than 100 miles past the airport where they were supposed to land. What happened? Stay with us. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: Widespread fraud could jeopardize efforts to extend that $8,000 first-time homebuyer credit. Let's go to Capitol Hill. Our congressional correspondent, Brianna Keilar, is looking into this story. Some astonishing findings from Treasury, I take it, Brianna. What's going on? BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Wolf. Of the million-plus Americans who have claimed this tax credit, including hundreds of thousands who would not have purchased a home without it, an IRS watchdog says of the wrongful claims, some of them could be fraud. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KEILAR (voice-over): Almost $4 million in first-time homebuyer tax credits were doled out to children. The youngest, a 4-year-old. J. RUSSELL GEORGE, TREASURY DEPARTMENT: Most indications are that the parent is attempting to bypass the income limitations for seeking the credit by attributing the home purchase to a minor. KEILAR: The IRS also OK'd $20 million in tax breaks to people who filed their taxes using only a taxpayer ID number, which doesn't guarantee they are living and working legally in the United States. And one of the most egregious examples of possible fraud? GEORGE: ... that among those who apparently wrongly claimed the credit are a number of Internal Revenue Service employees. KEILAR: Still, the National Association of Realtors estimates the first-time homebuyer program has generated 355,000 home sales that wouldn't have happened without the tax credit. And Democratic and Republican lawmakers are eager to extend the $8,000 tax break which expires December 1st. They want to buoy the depressed housing market as it goes into its traditionally slow season by reaching Americans who will legitimately use the credit, like Vina and Chris Gorres. VINA GORRES, HOMEBUYER: It's been a very long process for us. It's been almost over a year that we've been looking for a house. KEILAR: As they expand their family, they're eager to expand their living space and take advantage of the tax break. CHRIS GORRES, HOMEBUYER: It definitely doesn't hurt. It would be a nice bonus to have. (END VIDEOTAPE) KEILAR: What became clear in this hearing today on Capitol Hill was that in an effort to get this money out the door, the screening process by the IRS really wasn't all that tight. Then in May, the IRS included some additional screening measures, and they're also now, Wolf, asking Congress for more authority to make their rules even tighter should Congress extend this tax break. BLITZER: Brianna Keilar up on the Hill working the story. A lot of importance for a lot of people out there. Thank you. Dick Cheney's claim that the White House is dithering in Afghanistan. Should President Obama wait to see the outcome of the elections? We're going to talk about that and more in our ""Strategy Session."" Plus, U.S. strikes at brutal Mexican drug gangs. We're taking a closer look at the huge operation under way by U.S. agents right now and the violent cartel known as La Familia. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: New finger-pointing over the failures in the war in Afghanistan. The former vice president, Dick Cheney, hitting hard at the Obama administration. Our Brian Todd is following this latest war of words that's going on. Brian, ,it's heating up. BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It sure is, Wolf. And the title of Dick Cheney's speech says it all. It's called ""Concerns About America's Foreign Policy Drift."" How's that for ambiguity? He slams President Obama for changing the missile shield plan, for pursuing better relations with Iran, and for what he called ""dithering"" over what to do in Afghanistan. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RICHARD CHENEY, FMR. PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: President Obama now seems afraid to make a decision and unable to provide his commander on the ground with the troops he needs to complete the mission. TODD (voice-over): Dick Cheney says it's time for the president to give U.S. forces a clear mission in Afghanistan and the means to achieve it. Since leaving office, Cheney's never needed much of an excuse to tweak the current administration. And a remark by Mr. Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, on CNN's ""STATE OF THE UNION"" gave the former vice president another opening. RAHM EMANUEL, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: And when you go through all the analysis, it's clear that, basically, we had a war for eight years that was going on that's adrift, that we're beginning at scratch and just from the starting point after eight years. TODD: Cheney says when Obama's staff arrived at the White House, the Bush team handed them an updated Afghanistan strategy. CHENEY: The new strategy that they embraced in March with a focus on counterinsurgency and an increase in the number of troops bears a striking resemblance to the strategy we passed to them. Now they seem to be pulling back and blaming others for their failure to implement the strategy that they embraced last March. TODD: The Obama team says they increased troop levels in March after their predecessors didn't. ROBERT GIBBS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Given the fact that an increase in troops sat on desks in this White House, including the vice president's, for more than eight months, a resource request filled by President Obama in March. TODD: Will Cheney's criticisms increase the pressure to send more troops? DAVID GERGEN, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST: The Cheney speech could help to crystallize the arguments from conservatives, but I think the true pressure is coming from the general on the ground, General McChrystal. (END VIDEOTAPE) TODD: Now, the White House said today the president's decision could come at any time. Clearly, one of the most highly anticipated announcements of his young presidency -- Wolf. BLITZER: Brian, what did Dick Cheney say about the president's policies toward Iran? TODD: Well, he said that the president seems to be just pursuing better relations for better relations' sake, and that diplomacy won't work unless Iran fears real consequences. But Secretary of State Clinton said this week the administration is pursuing a dual-track approach, talks and sanctions, and that while the door is open to Iran for talks, it is not open-ended. BLITZER: Brian Todd, thanks very much. Let's bring in our ""Strategy Session"" guests. Joining us now, Don Baer. He's a Democratic strategist, has clients in the financial and health care industries. And Mary Matalin, our CNN political contributor, the Republican strategist. Eight months, Dick Cheney and George Bush sat on the recommendations of the military to deploy more troops to Afghanistan? And it took President Obama to finally make a decision to send more troops out as soon as he took office, Mary? MARY MATALIN, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Can you even say that with a straight face? BLITZER: That's what they're saying at the White House. MATALIN: It's one thing for the press secretary for the... (CROSSTALK) BLITZER: Is it factually true? MATALIN: It's completely untrue. BLITZER: You worked for Dick Cheney. MATALIN: Of the troops that McKiernan, the predecessor to McChrystal, asked for, a third of them were remissioned to Iraq. The following two-thirds that the administration, the Bush administration, was asked to hold on by the incoming Obama administration. So, that's dissembling. What the chief of staff said on Sunday on this network... BLITZER: Rahm Emanuel. MATALIN: ... that there was no plan, they had to start from scratch. The Bush administration, in an unprecedented transition, handed them a plan. Again, the national security advisers said sit on the plan. They adopted the plan in March and they're still dithering. They've had the benefit of the consultations of the best minds in defense and foreign policy. They've had it for a year. It's time to make a decision. BLITZER: You worked in the White House during the Clinton administration, Don. Why are they still dithering? DON BAER, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I don't understand this ""dithering."" I think what the American people want is for the president to apply his judgment, listen to what the experts say, and move forward on this. And clearly, he's going to do that after he's heard the evidence and made his decision. It's his decision. And with all respect to the former vice president, for him to be leveling a charge about dithering after the many, many years in Afghanistan when we didn't complete the mission, and the many, many years in Iraq where we didn't finish the job, I just don't think is an accusation that works. BLITZER: Hold your thoughts, guys, because we're going to take a quick break, continue this conversation. A lot more of our ""Strategy Session"" coming up. We're also taking a closer look at President Obama's to-do list. Is it getting longer? Stay with us. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: Let's get back to our ""Strategy Session."" Our friend Mark Halperin of ""TIME"" magazine, he says that there's a lot of stuff the president is not doing right now. He's punting, delaying acting on immigration reform, for example, climate deal, deficit reduction, ending ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"" don't pursue, all of that. Go ahead and explain. Why is the president doing everything at the same time? BAER: Another accusation I don't get. Right? The flip side of this is the president's been accused of trying to do too much, too fast. Right? Not focusing on things in sequence. But then they can always lop on sort of more logs on the fire that he hasn't dealt with. You all know. You've worked in the White House. You've covered the White House. Right now is the time I'm sure when the folks in the Obama White House are working on the State of the Union Address for next year. He's going to need an agenda for next year. These are all the kind of things he's going to take up. He's got to get through health care, Afghanistan, some of these other issues. And success is going to lead to success. BLITZER: Does that make sense to you? MATALIN: Don is exactly right. The reason that his popularity has fallen so precipitously, and support for his policies more so, is because he has done too much, too fast, too big. Slow down. Triple the deficit in nine months. So, when they get to their State of the Union speech, if they care about reducing the deficit, which should be their number one priority, it's the people's number one priority, they're not going to be able to do this -- all this other nonsense, cap and trade and all the rest of it. Too much, too fast. He can punt on some of these other things. Climate change is a fake issue anyway. ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" is going to happen. The military wants it. BLITZER: Why is it a fake issue? MATALIN: Because it's just -- there is not the science that they say is so. It's just an effort... BLITZER: No global warming? MATALIN: There is not consensus science on what is causing global climate change. There is climate change, but for the last decade the climate has been cooling. There is the science. There is the data on that. They want to do this because they like to have all these programs being controlled by the government. BLITZER: You know Al Gore is coming out with a new book in the next few weeks. He's coming after you, you know. MATALIN: Whoa. BLITZER: Get nervous. MATALIN: It's going to be inconvenient for him to have to actually answer some questions about all the falsities in his original book. BLITZER: Do you buy that notion of climate change and global warming? BAER: No. And I don't think that's generally the accepted science at all. And I do think the administration will be moving aggressively on that in the next year. And they have to take what's on the plate right now. As to the whole point about increasing the deficit, it's a huge problem. They are going to have to deal with it. But let's not forget what they inherited and why the deficit... (CROSSTALK) BAER: And why they've had to do these investment programs to get the economy moving again. MATALIN: One, the deficit that President Bush left them with was fully one-third less than what it is now. BAER: And he left them with a completely crashed economy also. So, they have been working through that. And... MATALIN: George Bush had the longest peacetime recession recovery in the history of this nation, 52 consecutive months. And growth was great. There was that issue with the derivatives which was a global issue. You can continue trying to blame that, as this administration does everything. At some point we're going to cross over to a place where every answer isn't Bush's fault, Bush's fault, Bush's fault. BAER: Well, I agree with that. It's time -- they were moving -- they're dealing with the issues they have to deal with it. So, there's really no credibility to the idea that they're not taking on the issues they have to take on. BLITZER: We've got issues coming up here in THE SITUATION ROOM as well, guys. Thanks very much for coming in. Graphic accounts from first responders to the deadliest subway crash in Washington, D.C.'s history. The emergency workers who pulled survivors out of the wreckage this summer, they tell us now what they saw. Plus, an unprecedented crackdown on a Mexican drug cartel going on right here in the United States as federal agents confiscate almost 12 tons of narcotics. And a year and a half in an isolation chamber with the cameras rolling the whole time. We're going to tell you how much the European Space Agency is paying for this simulated mission to Mars. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: It's big brother meets mission tomorrow as the European Space Agency is calling for candidates to spend -- get this -- 17 months in an isolation chamber to study the psychological effects of astronauts on a future mission to Mars. Let's bring in our Abbi Tatton. This is a big thing. Not everybody's going to be willing to volunteer for this. ABBI TATTON, CNN INTERNET REPORTER: Yes, it's hard to imagine who would do this. There's an almost 2,000 square foot chamber -- you can see it there -- in Moscow. But you'd be sharing it with five ore people for 520 days. And what you'd get for your trouble? About $25,000. That's what the European Space Agency is offering participants to simulate this 17-month mission to Mars. You can see the chamber here that you'd be spending your time in. And if you look at what they're doing, it reads a little more like reality TV at times. You'd be in there for 520 days. You've got delayed communication with the outside. You've got cameras on you 24/7. There's no shower, limited bathing facilities as well. And constant medical and psychological testing. And that's what this is all about. The European Space Agency is hoping this will help them examine the stress, the lack of privacy, isolation, confinement puts on human beings. BLITZER: What a nightmare. Who would want to do this? TATTON: Well, they've actually done it before, and they got applicants. They did a shorter trial earlier this year, just 105 days. And they had a flood of applications. These guys actually went through the 105 days. And they invited some of them back to do the longer trial."

Their cartoonish ad shows a smiling headshot of Frankel and makes a series of claims about her tenure as mayor. Here is part of the script:""Frankel took a 40 percent pay raise with our money. We lost jobs,"" says the narrator while the text on the screen states ""West Palm Beach lost jobs."" The ad then continues: ""Frankel flew from a posh country club to a party across town in a police helicopter. You sat in traffic. Frankel went on a spending spree resulting in a budget deficit. You? Higher taxes to pay for it. $13,000 in taxpayer money for a designer marble bathroom in Frankel's office.""You can read here about a TV station pulling the ad over a dispute about the word ""deficit."" (A spokesman for the PAC told us that a new version omits the word ""deficit"" and that some other stations didn’t object to the original version.)For this fact-check, we will examine whether Frankel took a 40 percent pay raise while West Palm Beach lost jobs.2004 pay raiseThe ad doesn’t explain when Frankel -- who served as mayor from 2003 to 2011 -- took that 40 percent pay raise. A spokesman for the PAC said the pay raise referred to 2004 and sent us quotes from Palm Beach Post articles that year.We will pull information from those articles:In January 2004, Frankel formed a committee to explore whether she and commissioners should get a pay raise. She said she was forming the committee because the city code required an annual review of all employee salaries. At the time, the city foresaw a budget shortfall of $110,000 -- the prior year it had a $2 million shortfall.The committee recommended increasing the mayor’s salary and the city commission obliged. (We were unable to quickly obtain the committee’s report or commission meeting minutes ourselves from a city spokesman so we relied on the Post’s articles about it.)On July 6, 2004, the city commission unanimously voted to raise Frankel’s salary from $89,250 to $125,000 effective Oct. 1. That’s an increase of about $35,750 or 40 percent. The last time the mayor received a raise was 1998, the Post wrote.Frankel didn’t vote on the pay raise, her campaign said. The city has a strong mayor form of government in which the mayor votes to break a tie, which wasn’t necessary in this case.The Post wrote that Frankel’s new salary would place her in the middle range compared with other strong mayors. (Strong mayors tend to earn higher salaries than other mayors because strong mayors are the chief executive.) The city commissioners received a smaller pay boost.(PolitiFact Florida contacted a couple other large cities with strong mayors and found these annual salaries in 2004: Tampa, $135,000; St. Petersburg $110,334.)An analyst in the city’s human resources department told us that Frankel’s annual salary remained at $125,000 from 2004 through 2011.Frankel’s response about the pay raiseFrankel doesn’t dispute that she got that pay raise.""The city commission voted unanimously to adopt the recommendations of a blue-ribbon committee that called for raising the salaries of West Palm Beach's elected officials to be more competitive,"" wrote Frankel spokesman Joshua Karp. He cited this sentence from a Palm Beach Post article: The blue-ribbon committee ""said the mayor’s pay hadn’t kept pace with the demands of the job in a fast-growing city.""But as for the second half of the claim -- while West Palm Beach ""lost jobs"" -- Frankel points to some different statistics about employment than those sent to us by the PAC.Were taxpayers losing their own jobs while paying Frankel a higher paycheck?The ad says that West Palm Beach lost jobs as Frankel’s own taxpayer-funded paycheck soared.A spokesman for the PAC sent us data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics about the unemployment rate starting in March 2003 when Frankel took office and through her tenure in March 2011 and beyond. But that data was for the entire metropolitan area, which extends beyond the city boundaries.We looked at Local Area Unemployment Statistics data for just the city of West Palm Beach. That showed the unemployment rate rose from 5.8 percent in March 2003 to 10.2 percent in March 2011. Frankel’s tenure overlapped with the national recession -- the rise in unemployment wasn’t unique to her city.But during her tenure, the number of employed workers also rose -- from 42,876 to 44,848. (Her campaign cited some regional figures showing growth in the number of employed people.)So while it’s true that unemployment rose, the number of employed workers also rose.We interviewed Sean Snaith, an economist at the University of Central Florida about the unemployment statistic emphasized by one side and the employment figures emphasized by the other. Both are important to get a picture of the labor market, he said.""You can't cherry-pick your favorite statistic and point to that and have it as definitive evidence,"" he said. ""Neither is superior.""The unemployment rate relates to the number of unemployed people relative to the labor force. That means if some unemployed people give up looking for work, the employment rate can improve even though in reality the situation hasn’t improved.Generally speaking, city mayors can’t take much of the blame or credit for unemployment or employment.""There is only so much (mayors) can do when financial markets are in disarray, and the housing market has imploded,"" Snaith said. ""I don’t care how adept you are at sweet-talking businesses.""If we thought that Frankel should take the blame for the unemployment spike during part of her tenure then we’d also have to give her credit for the drop in annual unemployment to below 4 percent between 2005 and 2007.Our rulingThe YG Action PAC said that ""Frankel took a 40 percent pay raise as mayor."" Frankel did form a committee to explore whether she should get a pay raise and that resulted in a 40 percent boost -- an extra $35,750 -- in 2004. However the ad omits the context for that raise -- the mayor’s salary hadn’t had an increase since 1998 and after she got the raise in 2004, her salary then remained set at $125,000 a year until she left office in 2011.The ad also stated that while Frankel got a hefty pay hike, the city ""lost jobs."" The unemployment rate rose from about 5.8 percent to 10.2 percent during her tenure. But the number of employed actually increased slightly and Frankel can’t be blamed for a national recession.If we look at the big swing that occurred in the economy, ""no mayor in the world would be able to counterbalance the forces that were in play,"" Snaith said.For those omissions about context, we rate this claim Half True.Advertisement"

In 2008, roughly “2.2 million votes were lost because of registration problems,” according to a report from the Voting Technology Project of the California Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Heather Gerken, a law professor at Yale, said the new report from Pew quantified and illuminated just how poorly the election system manages its most fundamental task. “Until Bush v. Gore, election administration was the dirty little secret of elections,” she said, referring to the Supreme Court decision that delivered the 2000 election to George W. Bush after poorly run elections in Florida. The flaws in the voter registration rolls have a disproportionately negative impact on mobile populations, including students and other young people, the poor and members of the military, the Pew report found. “It’s not clear that it has a uniform partisan effect,” Nathaniel Persily, a law professor and political scientist at Columbia, said of those findings. The Pew report compared state voter registration lists with a database maintained by Catalist, a company that collects and sells information about voting-age Americans based on data from public and commercial sources. The United States differs from most other modern democracies in relying on a decentralized election administration system that places the burden of registration on voters rather than treating registration as a government responsibility. “Part of the problem is that it is difficult for us to be proactive,” said Linda H. Lamone, Maryland’s administrator of elections. In Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Germany, Peru and Sweden, by contrast, the national government maintains its own registries of citizens eligible to vote, according to a 2009 report from the Brennan Center for Justice.

In 2008, for instance, Oregon spent $4.11 per active voter to process registrations. A 2001 study from the voting project found that local election offices spent a third of their budgets on registering voters. Canada, by contrast, spent less than 35 cents per voter to process registrations — and 93 percent of eligible voters there are registered. The registration process in the United States often involves handwritten forms, some collected by third parties. Those forms are then manually entered into an electronic system, a process bound to introduce flaws. People who move, moreover, often take no steps to inform administrators at their old addresses, and a new registration does not typically result in a notification to cancel the previous one. Yet a quarter of all voters assume that their registrations automatically move with them, the report found. As a consequence, active registrations in two states are common. Some 70,000 people are registered to vote in three or more states. This is also a consequence of a distinctively American approach. “The United States is unique both in its requirement that voters re-register each time they move and in the high mobility of the population,” Professor Persily and Stephen Ansolabehere, a professor of government at Harvard, wrote in a 2010 article, “Measuring Election System Performance,” in The New York University Journal of Legislation and Public Policy. One possible response, employed in Arizona and Washington State, is to allow online registration, which is cheaper, more accurate and more convenient but may raise security concerns. Ms. Lamone, the Maryland election official, said her state for now “is completely paper based” but would allow online registration starting in July for people with a valid state driver’s license or military identification. The Pew report urged administrators to make greater use of data-matching technologies commonly used by private businesses and to look to government resources like motor vehicle records, Social Security death records and the Postal Service’s change-of-address database. In an interview, Professor Persily proposed what he called an easy fix to many of the problems identified in the new report. The Postal Service’s change-of-address form, he said, could include a box that, when checked, would generate a cancellation notice directed to the old voting place and a registration request to the new one.

(The Washington Post)The final debate of the 2016 presidential race came as Hillary Clinton threatened to shut the door on Donald Trump and as Donald Trump threatened to unleash a torrent of attacks and accusations about the ""rigged"" election process.As the two met in Las Vegas on Wednesday night, we posted the transcript below, along with our analysis, fact checks and comments via annotation. To see an annotation, click on the highlighted text. To make your own, sign up for a Genius account .WALLACE: Good evening from the Thomas and Mack Center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News, and I welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.WALLACE: This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The commission has designed the format: Six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to those rules.For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. None of those questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, boos, or other interruptions so we and you can focus on what the candidates have to say.WALLACE: No noise, except right now, as we welcome the Democratic nominee for president, Secretary Clinton, and the Republican nominee for president, Mr. Trump.(APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, welcome. Let's get right to it. The first topic is the Supreme Court.You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this, because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments.WALLACE: Which means that you will, in effect, determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century.First of all, where do you want to see the court take the country? And secondly, what's your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted? Do the founders' words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances? In this segment, Secretary Clinton, you go first. You have two minutes.CLINTON: Thank you very much, Chris. And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be? What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens? What kind of rights will Americans have?And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court. But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.And I look forward to having that opportunity. I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them. That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate. The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, thank you.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, same question. Where do you want to see the court take the country? And how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted?TRUMP: Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody. The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about. Our country is so, so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices.Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent. And she was forced to apologize. And apologize she did. But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege. I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now. But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life. They will have a conservative bent. They will be protecting the Second Amendment. They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect. They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted. And I believe that's very, very important.I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear. It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be. And those are the people that I will appoint.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, thank you.WALLACE: We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion. I want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land. First is one that you mentioned, Mr. Trump, and that is guns.Secretary Clinton, you said last year, let me quote, ""The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment."" And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited. Those were the words of the Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision. What's wrong with that?CLINTON: Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment. I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years. I represented upstate New York. I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership. It goes back to the founding of our country.But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation. Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns. I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole. There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.You mentioned the Heller decision. And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them. And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others. So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment.WALLACE: Let me bring Mr. Trump in here. The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got. How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected? You just heard Secretary Clinton's answer. Does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms? TRUMP: Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it. I watched. I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld. And Justice Scalia was so involved. And it was a well-crafted decision. But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry. And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say.WALLACE: Well, let me bring in Secretary Clinton. Were you extremely upset?CLINTON: Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms. That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA. The gun lobby's on his side. They're running millions of dollars of ads against me. And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment. But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.WALLACE: Let me bring Mr. Trump back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high- capacity magazines. You support a national right to carry law. Why, sir?TRUMP: Well, let me just tell you before we go any further. In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city. So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment. And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA. And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president. So I'm very honored by all of that.We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment. We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.WALLACE: Well, let's pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that's the issue of abortion.TRUMP: Right.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, you're pro-life. But I want to ask you specifically: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes -- in fact, states -- a woman's right to abortion?TRUMP: Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.WALLACE: But I'm asking you specifically. Would you like to...TRUMP: If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.WALLACE: But what I'm asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn -- you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment. Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade?TRUMP: Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen. And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine. And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade. It is about what's happening right now in America.So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood. He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood. I will defend Planned Parenthood. I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton... CLINTON: And we have come too far to have that turned back now. And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions. And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.WALLACE: I'm going to give you a chance to respond, but I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes. You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights. You also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions. Why?CLINTON: Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account. And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make. I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions. So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, your reaction? And particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions.TRUMP: Well, I think it's terrible. If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK. But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day. And that's not acceptable.CLINTON: Well, that is not what happens in these cases. And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate. You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life. This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make. And I do not believe the government should be making it.You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country. I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania. And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice. And I will stand up for that right.WALLACE: All right. But just briefly, I want to move on to another segment...TRUMP: And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth. Nobody has that.WALLACE: All right. Let's move on to the subject of immigration. And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration. Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you.Mr. Trump, you want to build a wall. Secretary Clinton, you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border. Mr. Trump, you are calling for major deportations. Secretary Clinton, you say that within your first 100 days as president you're going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship. The question, really, is, why are you right and your opponent wrong?Mr. Trump, you go first in this segment. You have two minutes.TRUMP: Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years. We need strong borders.In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally. You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country. They're coming in illegally. Drugs are pouring in through the border. We have no country if we have no border.Hillary wants to give amnesty. She wants to have open borders. The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me. First time they've ever endorsed a candidate. It means their job is tougher. But they know what's going on. They know it better than anybody. They want strong borders. They feel we have to have strong borders.I was up in New Hampshire the other day. The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama. All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border. It's just pouring and destroying their youth. It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people. We have to have strong borders. We have to keep the drugs out of our country. We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash. We need strong borders. We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.Now, I want to build the wall. We need the wall. And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall. We stop the drugs. We shore up the border. One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out. We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border. And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest. But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Secretary Clinton. Basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong?CLINTON: Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not. They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.And you're right. I don't want to rip families apart. I don't want to be sending parents away from children. I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.We have 11 million undocumented people. They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people. He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation. Now, here's what that means. It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented. And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation. I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.I have been for border security for years. I voted for border security in the United States Senate. And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security. But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person. Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president. Didn't even raise it. He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly. And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.WALLACE: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. I want to follow up...TRUMP: Chris, I think it's...WALLACE: OK.TRUMP: I think I should respond to that. First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico. Very nice man. We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals. Believe me. The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody. It's a disaster.Hillary Clinton wanted the wall. Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts. Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built. But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.WALLACE: Well, let me -- wait, wait, sir, let me...TRUMP: We are a country of laws. We either have -- and by the way...WALLACE: Now, wait. I'd like to hear from...TRUMP: Well -- well, but she said one thing.WALLACE: I'd like to hear -- I'd like to hear from Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: I voted for border security, and there are...TRUMP: And the wall.CLINTON: There are some limited places where that was appropriate. There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages.And Donald knows a lot about this. He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower. He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ""You complain, I'll get you deported.""I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.WALLACE: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: President Obama has moved millions of people out. Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it. But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country. They've been deported. She doesn't want to say that, but that's what's happened, and that's what happened big league.As far as moving these people out and moving -- we either have a country or we don't. We're a country of laws. We either have a border or we don't.Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen. But it's very unfair. We have millions of people that did it the right way. They're on line. They're waiting. We're going to speed up the process, big league, because it's very inefficient. But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens.Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders. You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.WALLACE: I want to...TRUMP: But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I want to...CLINTON: We will not have open borders. That is...WALLACE: Well, let me -- Secretary...CLINTON: That is a rank mischaracterization.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton...CLINTON: We will have secure borders, but we'll also have reform. And this used to be a bipartisan issue. Ronald Reagan was the last president...WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, excuse me. Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: ... to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I want to clear up your position on this issue, because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank, for which you were paid $225,000, we've learned from the WikiLeaks, that you said this, and I want to quote. ""My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders."" So that's the question...TRUMP: Thank you.WALLACE: That's the question. Please quiet, everybody. Is that your dream, open borders? CLINTON: Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy. You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined. And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders. I think that would be a great benefit to us.But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks. And what's really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans. They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions. Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet.This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election.CLINTON: So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past? Those are the questions we need answered. We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.WALLACE: Well?TRUMP: That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK? How did we get on to Putin?WALLACE: Hold on -- hold on, wait. Hold on, folks. Because we -- this is going to end up getting out of control. Let's try to keep it quiet so -- for the candidates and for the American people.TRUMP: So just to finish on the borders...WALLACE: Yes?TRUMP: She wants open borders. People are going to pour into our country. People are going to come in from Syria. She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people. They have no idea where they come from.And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country. She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama. So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders.Now we can talk about Putin. I don't know Putin. He said nice things about me. If we got along well, that would be good. If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.He has no respect for her. He has no respect for our president. And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads. And she's playing chicken. Look, Putin...WALLACE: Wait, but...TRUMP: ... from everything I see, has no respect for this person.CLINTON: Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.TRUMP: No puppet. No puppet.CLINTON: And it's pretty clear...TRUMP: You're the puppet!CLINTON: It's pretty clear you won't admit...TRUMP: No, you're the puppet.CLINTON: ... that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation. We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election. We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election. I find that deeply disturbing.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton...CLINTON: And I think it's time you take a stand...TRUMP: She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else.CLINTON: I am not quoting myself.TRUMP: She has no idea.CLINTON: I am quoting 17...TRUMP: Hillary, you have no idea.CLINTON: ... 17 intelligence -- do you doubt 17 military and civilian...TRUMP: And our country has no idea.CLINTON: ... agencies.TRUMP: Yeah, I doubt it. I doubt it.CLINTON: Well, he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us. I find that just absolutely...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.WALLACE: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: Excuse me. Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.WALLACE: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: He's outsmarted her every step of the way.WALLACE: I do get to ask some questions.TRUMP: Yes, that's fine.WALLACE: And I would like to ask you this direct question. The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks. Even if you don't know for sure whether they are, do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American election?TRUMP: By Russia or anybody else.WALLACE: You condemn their interference?TRUMP: Of course I condemn. Of course I -- I don't know Putin. I have no idea.WALLACE: I'm not asking -- I'm asking do you condemn?TRUMP: I never met Putin. This is not my best friend. But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad.Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way. Whether it's Syria, you name it. Missiles. Take a look at the ""start up"" that they signed. The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this. They create warheads, and we can't. The Russians can't believe it. She has been outsmarted by Putin.And all you have to do is look at the Middle East. They've taken over. We've spent $6 trillion. They've taken over the Middle East. She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever.WALLACE: We're a long way away from immigration, but I'm going to let you finish this topic. You got about 45 seconds.TRUMP: And she always will be.CLINTON: I -- I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons. This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons. He's...TRUMP: Wrong. CLINTON: ... advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia. He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying.But here's the deal. The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed. There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so. And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.TRUMP: I have 200 generals...WALLACE: Very quickly.TRUMP: ... and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients. As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the -- we're defending other countries. We are spending a fortune doing it. They have the bargain of the century.All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places. We cannot continue to afford -- she took that as saying nuclear weapons.WALLACE: OK.TRUMP: Look, she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways. This is just another lie.CLINTON: Well, I'm just quoting you when you were asked...TRUMP: There's no quote. You're not going to find a quote from me.CLINTON: ... about a potential nuclear -- nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks. That kind...TRUMP: And defend yourselves.CLINTON: ... of language -- well...TRUMP: And defend yourselves. I didn't say nuclear. And defend yourself.CLINTON: The United States has kept the peace -- the United States has kept the peace through our alliances. Donald wants to tear up our alliances. I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer. I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere. That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace.WALLACE: We're going to -- no, we are going to move on to the next topic, which is the economy. And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration. You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster. Secretary Clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role. You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties. Mr. Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation.TRUMP: Yes.WALLACE: We're going to drill down into this a little bit more. But in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent's plan will not. In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives. And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities. I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should. New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.I want us to do more to help small business. That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from. I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty. And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college. That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future. I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is. Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top. So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share. We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs. By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs. Why? Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities. The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.WALLACE: Secretary, thank you. Mr. Trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton's?TRUMP: Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes. Her tax plan is a disaster. And she can say all she wants about college tuition. And I'm a big proponent. We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition. But the rest of the public's going to be paying for it. We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan.TRUMP: But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries. Saudi Arabia, nothing but money. We protect Saudi Arabia. Why aren't they paying?She immediately -- when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO. Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying? Because they weren't paying.Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying. And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it. All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up. They have to pay up. We're protecting people, they have to pay up. And I'm a big fan of NATO. But they have to pay up.She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great. Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out. We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt. We're up to $20 trillion.So my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals. We're going to have a lot of free trade. We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now. But we have horrible deals. Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever. Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them. You go upstate New York. Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places. We're bringing our jobs back.I am going to renegotiate NAFTA. And if I can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals. We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal.And if we can't, we're going to do it -- we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster. We are going to cut taxes massively. We're going to cut business taxes massively. They're going to start hiring people. We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion...WALLACE: Time, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: ... that's offshore back into the country. We are going to start the engine rolling again, because...WALLACE: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: ... right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP.CLINTON: Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because...TRUMP: You can't.CLINTON: ... the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration. I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.I also will not add a penny to the debt. I have costed out what I'm going to do. He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.Well, he mentioned the debt. We know how to get control of the debt. When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt. When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people. So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead. That's the kind of approach that will work.WALLACE: Secretary...CLINTON: Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we've tried that. It has not worked the way that it has been promised.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I want to pursue your plan, because in many ways it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009, which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949.TRUMP: Correct.WALLACE: Thank you, sir.You told me in July when we spoke that the problem is that President Obama didn't get to do enough in what he was trying to do with his stimulus. So is your plan basically more -- even more of the Obama stimulus?CLINTON: Well, it's a combination, Chris. And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation. I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state. I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy. He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions. But it was a terrible recession.So now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running. So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down. That is not going to work.That's why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs. We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs. We've got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that's what I believe I will be able to do.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers don't add up, that your idea, and you've talked about 25 million jobs created, 4 percent...TRUMP: Over a 10-year period.WALLACE: ... growth is unrealistic. And they say -- you talk a lot about growing the energy industry. They say with oil prices as low as they are right now, that's unrealistic, as well. Your response, sir?TRUMP: So I just left some high representatives of India. They're growing at 8 percent. China is growing at 7 percent. And that for them is a catastrophically low number.We are growing -- our last report came out -- and it's right around the 1 percent level. And I think it's going down. Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report. A terrible jobs report. In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election? Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad. The report was so bad.Look, our country is stagnant. We've lost our jobs. We've lost our businesses. We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking. Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.I've visited so many communities. This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris. I've gotten to know so many -- I've developed so many friends over the last year. And they cry when they see what's happened. I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what's happened to these people in these communities.Now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn't really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left. Boy, did they suffer. That was one of the worst things that's ever been signed by our country.Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership. And she wants it. She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates. She totally lied. She did call it the gold standard. And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right. I was so honored.WALLACE: I want you to give you a chance to briefly speak to that, and then I want to pivot to one-sixth of the economy...TRUMP: And that will be as bad as NAFTA.WALLACE: ... which is Obamacare. But go ahead, briefly.CLINTON: Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it. It didn't meet my test. I've had the same test. Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security? I'm against it now. I'll be against it after the election. I'll be against it when I'm president.There's only one of us on this stage who's actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that's Donald. He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.But he mentioned China. And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets. I have fought against that as a senator. I've stood up against it as secretary of state.Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum. In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel. So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers.WALLACE: Mr. Trump?CLINTON: That's the kind of approach that is just not going to work.TRUMP: Well, let me just say -- let me just say.CLINTON: We're going to pull the country together. We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce. That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history. And we're going to enforce those agreements, and we're going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton? Go ahead, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Let me ask a simple question. She's been doing this for 30 years. Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years?CLINTON: No, I voted.TRUMP: You were very much involved -- excuse me. My turn. You were very much involved in every aspect of this country. Very much. And you do have experience. I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it's bad experience, because what you've done has turned out badly.For 30 years, you've been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else, I -- make it impossible for me to do that. I wouldn't mind.The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary. You don't. Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing. How do you miss $6 billion? You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen. They don't know. It's gone, $6 billion. If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess. Believe me.CLINTON: Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times.CLINTON: But I think it's really an important issue. He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that. You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund. And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools. He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas. He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses. In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said women's rights are human rights. He insulted a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, called her an eating machine.TRUMP: Give me a break.CLINTON: And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the ""Celebrity Apprentice."" So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision.TRUMP: Well, I think I did a much better job. I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars. I started with a $1 million loan. I agree with that. It's a $1 million loan. But I built a phenomenal company.And if we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of. You would even be proud of it.And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria. Take a look at the migration. Take a look at Libya. Take a look at Iraq. She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when -- we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out. She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there. And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries. And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS. She's going to get rid of nobody.WALLACE: All right. We are going to get to foreign hot spots in a few moments, but the next segment is fitness to be president of the United States. Mr. Trump, at the last debate, you said your talk about grabbing women was just that, talk, and that you'd never actually done it. And since then, as we all know, nine women have come forward and have said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent.Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years, why would they all in this last couple of weeks make up -- you deny this -- why would they all make up these stories?Since this is a question for both of you, Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump says what your husband did and that you defended was even worse. Mr. Trump, you go first.TRUMP: Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked. Those people -- I don't know those people. I have a feeling how they came. I believe it was her campaign that did it.Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence? She's the one and Obama that caused the violence. They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.I would say the only way -- because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that. And I didn't even apologize to my wife, who's sitting right here, because I didn't do anything. I didn't know any of these -- I didn't see these women.These women -- the woman on the plane, the -- I think they want either fame or her campaign did it. And I think it's her campaign. Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence.And I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot. And that was now all on tape, started by her. I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward. If it wasn't, they get their 10 minutes of fame. But they were all totally -- it was all fiction. It was lies, and it was fiction.CLINTON: Well...WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women. And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them. Now, what was his response? Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted.TRUMP: I did not say that. I did not say that.CLINTON: In fact, he went on to say... WALLACE: Her two minutes -- sir, her two minutes. Her two minutes.TRUMP: I did not say that.WALLACE: It's her two minutes.CLINTON: He went on to say, ""Look at her. I don't think so."" About another woman, he said, ""That wouldn't be my first choice."" He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her ""disgusting,"" as he has called a number of women during this campaign.Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like. So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women. That's who Donald is.I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.America is great, because America is good. And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.WALLACE: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: Nobody has more respect for women than I do. Nobody.(LAUGHTER)Nobody has more respect...WALLACE: Please, everybody.TRUMP: And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked. And I really want to just talk about something slightly different.She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign. But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.What happened to the FBI, I don't know. We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI. One lie. She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI. He's going to probably go to jail. This is a four-star general. And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States? That's really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility. And it's not just about women. He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything.So we know what he has said and what he's done to women. But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.TRUMP: Wrong.CLINTON: He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion. He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers ""people who aren't captured."" He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn't be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican.So it's not one thing. This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies. That is not who America is.And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election. It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have.TRUMP: So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence. It's on tape.WALLACE: During the last...TRUMP: The other things are false, but honestly, I'd love to talk about getting rid of ISIS, and I'd love to talk about other things...WALLACE: OK.TRUMP: ... but those other charges, as she knows, are false.WALLACE: In this bucket about fitness to be president, there's been a lot of developments over the last 10 days since the last debate. I'd like to ask you about them. These are questions that the American people have.Secretary Clinton, during your 2009 Senate confirmation hearing, you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the Clinton Foundation while you were secretary of state, but e-mails show that donors got special access to you. Those seeking grants for Haiti relief were considered separately from non-donors, and some of those donors got contracts, government contracts, taxpayer money.Can you really say that you kept your pledge to that Senate committee? And why isn't what happened and what went on between you and the Clinton Foundation, why isn't it what Mr. Trump calls pay to play?CLINTON: Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values. The State Department has said that. I think that's been proven.But I am happy, in fact I'm thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation, because it is a world-renowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does. You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate -- I know I don't have the time to do that.But just briefly, the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV-AIDS to afford treatment, and that's about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment. In partnership with the American Health Association...WALLACE: Secretary Clinton...CLINTON: ... we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches...WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, respectfully, this is -- this is an open discussion.CLINTON: Well, it is an open discussion. And you...WALLACE: And the specific question went to pay for play. Do you want to talk about that?CLINTON: Well, but there is no -- but there is no evidence -- but there is...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I think that it's been very well...WALLACE: Let's ask Mr. Trump.CLINTON: There is a lot of evidence about the very good work...TRUMP: It's been very well studied.CLINTON: ... and the high rankings...(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Please let me Mr. Trump speak.TRUMP: ... and it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it.WALLACE: Please let Mr. Trump speak.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: It's a criminal enterprise. Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries. You talk about women and women's rights? So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings. These are people that kill women and treat women horribly. And yet you take their money.So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly? Why don't you give back the money? I think it would be a great gesture.Because she takes a tremendous amount of money. And you take a look at the people of Haiti. I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida. And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace. And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent -- 90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country. I'm very proud of that. We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations. And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald. I mean, who does that? It just was astonishing.But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere. The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti. Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years. The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had.We have done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else. And we're going to keep working to help Haiti...WALLACE: All right.CLINTON: ... because it's an important part of the American experience.TRUMP: They don't want you to help them anymore.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I'd like to mention one thing. Trump Foundation, small foundation. People contribute, I contribute. The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military. I don't get anything. I don't buy boats. I don't buy planes. What happens -- the money goes to them.WALLACE: Wasn't some of the money used to settle your lawsuits, sir?TRUMP: No, it was -- we put up the American flag. And that's it. They put up the American flag. We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag.WALLACE: Right. But there was a penalty that was imposed by Palm Beach County, and the money came from your foundation...TRUMP: There was. There was. And, by the way...WALLACE: ... instead of Mar-a-Lago or yourself, sir.TRUMP: ... the money -- the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses -- the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets.WALLACE: I want to get into one...CLINTON: But, of course, there's no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn't released his tax returns. He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can't prove it. You can look at our tax returns. We've got them all out there.But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax. And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris. You know, half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax. So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire. I find that just astonishing.WALLACE: I want...TRUMP: So let me just tell you very quickly, we're entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it. And all of her donors -- just about all of them -- I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars...WALLACE: We...TRUMP: Let me just explain.WALLACE: But, no, we heard this...TRUMP: Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, we -- OK.TRUMP: You know what she should have done?WALLACE: Folks, we heard this...TRUMP: And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator...WALLACE: Folks, we heard this...TRUMP: ... because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so.CLINTON: Well, you know...TRUMP: You should have changed the law. But you won't change the law, because you take in so much money. I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump...CLINTON: Made with Chinese steel.TRUMP: But I will tell you, I sat there...(LAUGHTER)... I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad. All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them. And, frankly, you should have changed the laws.WALLACE: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about one last question in this topic. You have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you.Your running mate, Governor Pence, pledged on Sunday that he and you -- his words -- ""will absolutely accept the result of this election."" Today your daughter, Ivanka, said the same thing. I want to ask you here on the stage tonight: Do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely -- sir, that you will absolutely accept the result of this election?TRUMP: I will look at it at the time. I'm not looking at anything now. I'll look at it at the time.What I've seen -- what I've seen is so bad. First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing. The New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care. It's so dishonest. And they've poisoned the mind of the voters.But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it. I think they're going to see through it. We'll find out on November 8th. But I think they're going to see through it.WALLACE: But, sir, there's...TRUMP: If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.So let me just give you one other thing. So I talk about the corrupt media. I talk about the millions of people -- tell you one other thing. She shouldn't be allowed to run. It's crooked -- she's -- she's guilty of a very, very serious crime. She should not be allowed to run.And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never...WALLACE: But...TRUMP: Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things.WALLACE: But, sir, there is a tradition in this country -- in fact, one of the prides of this country -- is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner. Not saying that you're necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country. Are you saying you're not prepared now to commit to that principle?TRUMP: What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense. OK?CLINTON: Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying. You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails. They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged. He lost the Iowa caucus. He lost the Wisconsin primary. He said the Republican primary was rigged against him. Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him. There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.TRUMP: Should have gotten it.(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: This is -- this is a mindset. This is how Donald thinks. And it's funny, but it's also really troubling.WALLACE: OK.CLINTON: So that is not the way our democracy works. We've been around for 240 years. We've had free and fair elections. We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them. And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election. You know, President Obama said the other day when you're whining before the game is even finished...(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Hold on. Hold on, folks. Hold on, folks.CLINTON: ... it just shows you're not up to doing the job. And let's -- you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means. He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy. And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position.TRUMP: I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it's disgraceful. I think it's a disgrace.WALLACE: All right.TRUMP: I think we've never had a situation so bad in this country.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Hold on, folks. This doesn't do any good for anyone. Let's please continue the debate, and let's move on to the subject of foreign hot spots.The Iraqi offensive to take back Mosul has begun. If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq, the question then becomes, what happens the day after? And that's something that whichever of you ends up -- whoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront.Will you put U.S. troops into that vacuum to make sure that ISIS doesn't come back or isn't replaced by something even worse? Secretary Clinton, you go first in this segment. You have two minutes.CLINTON: Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground. But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force. I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do. In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself.The goal here is to take back Mosul. It's going to be a hard fight. I've got no illusions about that. And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation. But we know we've got lots of work to do. Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue.So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS. That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons. If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun.And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, same question. If we are able to push ISIS out of Mosul and out of Iraq, will -- would you be willing to put U.S. troops in there to prevent their return or something else?TRUMP: Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad. We had Mosul. But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul. Now we're fighting again to get Mosul. The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul.About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul. Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK? We announce we're going after Mosul. I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months? These people have all left. They've all left.The element of surprise. Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country. So we're now fighting for Mosul, that we had. All she had to do was stay there, and now we're going in to get it.But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it? And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough. They want to look good. He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes. That's why we have the great migration. But she wanted to look good for the election. So they're going in.But who's going to get Mosul, really? We'll take Mosul eventually. But the way -- if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought. Much, much tougher. Much more dangerous. Going to be more deaths that they thought.But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart. They say, what do we need this for? So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing. And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid -- the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons. Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them.So we're now going to take Mosul. And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary? Iran. Oh, yeah, they're making -- I mean, they are outsmarting -- look, you're not there, you might be involved in that decision. But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq. You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it. You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.WALLACE: Sir, your two minutes are up.TRUMP: The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran.CLINTON: Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq. I said it was a mistake. I've said that years ago. He has consistently denied what is...TRUMP: Wrong.CLINTON: ... a very clear fact that...TRUMP: Wrong.CLINTON: ... before the invasion, he supported it. And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it. Google ""Donald Trump Iraq."" And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.TRUMP: Wrong.CLINTON: And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that. Now, why does that matter? Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position. I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay. Mosul is a Sunni city. Mosul is on the border of Syria. And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and -- just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" and we brought him to justice. We need to go after the leadership.But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters. There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul. They've been digging underground. They've been prepared to defend. It's going to be tough fighting. But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa.This is what we have to do. I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that's how Donald thinks. You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy.TRUMP: Chris, we don't gain anything.CLINTON: He has all the conspiracy theories...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Iran is taking over Iraq.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, it's...TRUMP: Iran is taking over Iraq. We don't gain anything.CLINTON: This conspiracy theory, which he's been spewing out for quite some time.TRUMP: If they did it by surprise...(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Wait, wait, wait, Secretary Clinton, it's an open discussion.CLINTON: He says...TRUMP: We could have gained if they did it by surprise.WALLACE: Secretary, please let Mr. Trump speak.CLINTON: ... unfit, and he proves it every time he talks.TRUMP: No, you are the one that's unfit. You know, WikiLeaks just actually came out -- John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right. He said some beauties. And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment. You do.And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone. If you think that was good, then you do. Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts. Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment. I agree with both.CLINTON: Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president. And he has said...TRUMP: Which is a big mistake.CLINTON: ... as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America. I think he's right.WALLACE: Let's turn to Aleppo. Mr. Trump, in the last debate, you were both asked about the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo. And I want to follow up on that, because you said several things in that debate which were not true, sir. You said that Aleppo has basically fallen. In fact, there -- in fact, there are... TRUMP: It's a catastrophe. I mean...WALLACE: It's a catastrophe, but there...TRUMP: ... it's a mess.WALLACE: There are a quarter of...TRUMP: Have you seen it? Have you seen it?WALLACE: Sir...TRUMP: Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo?WALLACE: Sir, if I may finish my question...TRUMP: OK, so it hasn't fallen. Take a look at it.WALLACE: Well, there are a quarter of a million people still living there and being slaughtered.TRUMP: That's right. And they are being slaughtered...WALLACE: Yes.TRUMP: ... because of bad decisions.WALLACE: If I may just finish here, and you also said that -- that Syria and Russia are busy fighting ISIS. In fact, they have been the ones who've been bombing and shelling eastern Aleppo, and they just announced a humanitarian pause, in effect, admitting that they have been bombing and shelling Aleppo. Would you like to clear that up, sir?TRUMP: Well, Aleppo is a disaster. It's a humanitarian nightmare. But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint. I mean, what do you need, a signed document? Take a look at Aleppo. It is so sad when you see what's happened.And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama. And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago. He -- he aligned with Russia.He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful. We gave them $150 billion back. We give them $1.7 billion in cash. I mean, cash. Bundles of cash as big as this stage. We gave them $1.7 billion.Now they have -- he has aligned with Russia and with Iran. They don't want ISIS, but they have other things, because we're backing -- we're backing rebels. We don't know who the rebels are. We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything. We don't know who the rebels are. And when and if -- and it's not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now. But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with -- as bad as Assad is, and he's a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad.If she did nothing, we'd be in much better shape. And this is what's caused the great migration, where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases -- not probably, who are definitely...WALLACE: Let me...TRUMP: ... in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see -- this is going to be the great Trojan horse. And wait until you see what happens in the coming years. Lots of luck, Hillary. Thanks a lot for doing a great job.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, you have talked about -- and in the last debate and again today -- that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there. President Obama has refused to do that because he fears it's going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict.And General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says you impose a no-fly zone, chances are you're going to get into a war -- his words -- with Syria and Russia. So the question I have is, if you impose a no-fly zone -- first of all, how do you respond to their concerns? Secondly, if you impose a no-fly zone and a Russian plane violates that, does President Clinton shoot that plane down?CLINTON: Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict. I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.This would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation. And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated. So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees. He's made these claims repeatedly. I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in. But I am not going to slam the door on women and children. That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting. And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting. That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks. In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born. So let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we've got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home.WALLACE: Folks, I want to get into our final segment.TRUMP: But I just have to...WALLACE: Real quick.TRUMP: It's so ridiculous what she -- she will defeat ISIS. We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place. And right now, they're in 32 countries.WALLACE: OK.TRUMP: We should have -- wait one second. They had a cease-fire three weeks ago. A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria. And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore.We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires. They are outplayed. Now, she wasn't there. I assume she had nothing to do with it. But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way -- and by Iran. Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton -- no, we need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight.Our national debt, as a share of the economy, our GDP, is now 77 percent. That's the highest since just after World War II. But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says, Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years. Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years. The question is, why are both of you ignoring this problem? Mr. Trump, you go first.TRUMP: Well, I say they're wrong, because I'm going to create tremendous jobs. And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero. But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent. And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent. I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent. And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine. We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again. To do that, we're taking back jobs. We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don't make our product anymore. It's very sad. But I'm going to create a -- the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry. We used to be there. We've given it up. We've become very, very sloppy.We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies. You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don't use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say. But we don't use those people. Those are the people -- these are the greatest negotiators in the world. We have the greatest businesspeople in the world. We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.We use political hacks. We use people that get the position because they gave -- they made a campaign contribution and they're dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are. So we have to use our great people.But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades. And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money. And we'll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is ""Make America Great Again,"" I wonder when he thought America was great. And before he rushes and says, ""You know, before you and President Obama were there,"" I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades.You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world. He was criticizing President Reagan. This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, ""You know, I alone can fix it,"" as he said on the convention stage.But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I'm proposing. I do not add a penny to the national debt. I take that very seriously, because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with.So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear we are going where the money is. We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth. In fact, I think just the opposite. We'll have what economists call middle-out growth. We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America. That's where growth will come from. That's why I want to invest in you. I want to invest in your family.And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer. And we just have a big disagreement about this. It may be because of our experiences. You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire...TRUMP: Yeah, yeah, we've heard -- we've heard this before, Hillary.CLINTON: I started off with -- my dad was a small-business man.TRUMP: We've heard this before.CLINTON: And I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.WALLACE: Time.TRUMP: Thank you, Hillary. Could I just respond?WALLACE: Well, no, sir, because we're running out of time...TRUMP: Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade. I disagreed with him. We should have been much tougher on trade even then. I've been waiting for years. Nobody does it right.WALLACE: OK.TRUMP: And frankly, now we're going to do it right.WALLACE: All right. The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60 percent of all federal spending. Now, the Committee for federal -- a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare's going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits.So, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is -- and let me start with you, Mr. Trump, would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements?TRUMP: I'm cutting taxes. We're going to grow the economy. It's going to grow at a record rate of growth.WALLACE: That's not going to help in the entitlements.TRUMP: No, it's going to totally help you. And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. It's destroying our country. It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster. If we don't repeal and replace -- now, it's probably going to die of its own weight. But Obamacare has to go. It's -- the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent. Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent.And I'm really glad that the premiums have started -- at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse. Bad health care at the most expensive price. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.WALLACE: And, Secretary Clinton, same question, because at this point, Social Security and Medicare are going to run out, the trust funds are going to run out of money. Will you as president entertain -- will you consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs?CLINTON: Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund. That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy. My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it. But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund...TRUMP: Such a nasty woman.CLINTON: ... by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it. I will not cut benefits. I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt. That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal. The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund. So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse. What we need to do is go after...TRUMP: Your husband disagrees with you.CLINTON: ... the long-term health care drivers. We've got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness. I have a plan for doing that. And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.WALLACE: This is -- this is the final time, probably to both of your delight, that you're going to be on a stage together in this campaign. I would like to end it on a positive note. You had not agreed to closing statements, but it seems to me in a funny way that might make it more interesting because you haven't prepared closing statements.So I'd like you each to take -- and we're going to put a clock up, a minute, as the final question in the final debate, to tell the American people why they should elect you to be the next president. This is another new mini-segment. Secretary Clinton, it's your turn to go first.CLINTON: Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone. We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition.You know, I've been privileged to see the presidency up close. And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you. I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work.That's what my mission will be in the presidency. I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations. I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college. I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, thank you.Mr. Trump?TRUMP: She's raising the money from the people she wants to control. Doesn't work that way.But when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly. It's called ""Make America Great Again."" We're going to make America great. We have a depleted military. It has to be helped, has to be fixed. We have the greatest people on Earth in our military. We don't take care of our veterans. We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets. That can't happen.Our policemen and women are disrespected. We need law and order, but we need justice, too. Our inner cities are a disaster. You get shot walking to the store. They have no education. They have no jobs. I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes.All she's done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos, but they get the vote, and then they come back, they say, we'll see you in four years. We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now. We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her.WALLACE: Thank you both.(APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton -- hold on just a moment, folks. Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, I want to thank you both for participating in all three of these debates.That brings to an end this year's debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. We want to thank the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and its students for having us. Now the decision is up to you.While millions have already voted, Election Day, November 8th, is just 20 days away. One thing everyone here can agree on: We hope you will go vote. It is one of the honors and obligations of living in this great country. Thank you, and good night.1 of 20"

That will hurt the quality of our care.""— 60 Plus Association on Wednesday, September 8th, 2010 in a campaign adMedicare 'cuts' in the health care law will hurt seniors, says 60 Plus AssociationBy Angie Drobnic Holan on Monday, September 20th, 2010 at 3:23 p.m.The conservative 60 Plus Association has run similar ads against Democratic members of Congress.Guess which member of Congress ""betrayed"" seniors by voting in favor of the 2010 health care law, a vote for ""Nancy Pelosi's health care bill which will cut $500 billion from Medicare"" and ""hurt the quality of our care.""Which member is it? Well, lots of them, according to the 60 Plus Association. The advocacy group bills itself as ""a conservative alternative to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP)"" and supports"" a free-enterprise, less -government, less-taxes approach to seniors issues."" It has created substantially similar ads to run against Democratic members of Congress in districts around the country.In Florida, the group is targeting Rep. Allen Boyd, who represents the Panhandle area, and Reps. Alan Grayson and Suzanne Kosmas, both from central Florida. It is also running ads against Wisconsin members Steve Kagen, representing Green Bay and Appleton, and Ron Kind of western Wisconsin. Another target is John Boccieri of Canton, Ohio. Still other ads target House members from Arizona, New York, Indiana and Pennsylvania.It's true that all of these members of Congress voted in favor of the new health care law when it came up for a vote on March 21, 2010. But the ad gives a highly misleading impression about funding for Medicare.Here's the text of the ad running against Boyd, the Florida congressman who represents the northwest Panhandle area:""Alan Boyd has betrayed Florida's seniors. Instead of voting to protect us, he supported Nancy Pelosi's liberal agenda. Boyd voted for Nancy Pelosi's health care bill which will cut $500 billion from Medicare. That will hurt the quality of our care. ... Florida's seniors can send Alan Boyd a message. He betrayed us, and this November, we'll remember.""Because of our previous fact-checks on the health care law, we knew this ad was leaving out important details on how the health care law, formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, changed Medicare.Medicare, a government-run health insurance program, provides health care coverage for the vast majority of Americans over age 65. It accounts for about 12 percent of the federal budget.It's important to note that the law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. Rather, the bill attempts to slow the program's future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in future spending over the next 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase -- the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009.Next, we wanted to address how those reductions are expected to affect the quality of care.""Some (changes) increase Medicare spending to improve benefits and coverage,"" said Tricia Neuman, director of the Medicare Policy Project at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. ""Other provisions reduce the growth in Medicare spending to help the program operate more efficiently and help fund coverage expansions to the uninsured in the underlying health reform legislation. Other provisions are designed to improve the delivery of care and quality of care.""Neuman walked through the changes in an easily digestible tutorial on the Kaiser Family Foundation's website , a good non-ideological explanation for people interested in changes to Medicare under health care reform.Some of the savings are for relatively minor programs, such as $36 billion for increases in premiums for higher-income beneficiaries and $12 billion for administrative changes. The law directs a new national board to identify $15.5 billion in savings, but the board -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits.More significantly, there's also $136 billion in projected savings that would come from changes to the Medicare Advantage program. About 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan.Let's back-up for a minute and explain Medicare Advantage: There are two basic ways most people get Medicare coverage. They enroll in traditional Medicare and a prescription drug plan through the government and maybe buy a supplemental policy to cover most out-of-pocket costs. Or they enroll in Medicare Advantage programs (they include drug plans), which are run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage programs typically have more generous benefits such as dental and vision coverage. Some plans even pay the patient’s monthly Medicare premium, which can amount to about $100.The Medicare Advantage program was intended to bring more efficiency from the private sector to the Medicare program, but it hasn't worked as planned. A June 2009 analysis from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission said that the Advantage programs costs taxpayers on average of 14 percent more than the traditional Medicare plan. President Barack Obama has said repeatedly that the Medicare Advantage plan wastes public money that could be put to better use.The health care law that President Obama signed in March phases out extra payments for Medicare Advantage programs over the next three to six years to bring their costs in line with traditional Medicare and institutes other rules for the program.""How these payment changes will affect beneficiaries remains to be seen -- but is expected to vary across the country,"" Neuman said. ""The Congressional Budget Office projects the law will result in fewer enrollees in Medicare Advantage plans, and fewer extra benefits for Medicare Advantage enrollees, on average. It is also possible that the number of plans available to beneficiaries will decline -- which may or may not be a concern. On average, Medicare beneficiaries have 30 plans available to them in 2010.""PolitiFact has waded into this argument about whether the adjustments to the Medicare Advantage option constitute a cut before . Most experts we talked to had the same answer: yes and no.On one hand, they might not be considered cuts because nowhere in the bill are benefits actually eliminated, experts said. And other parts of the bill expand coverage for seniors and ultimately make some components of Medicare less expensive for patients. (More on this in a bit.)Still, changes could be in store for Medicare Advantage participants, especially the extra benefits that people receive under Advantage, experts said. But basic benefits that mirror regular Medicare will stay the same.Finally, there's $220 billion in Medicare savings achieved by reducing annual increases in payments health care providers would otherwise receive from Medicare. The reductions are part of programs intended to improve care and make it more efficient, such as reducing payments for preventable hospital re-admissions. These adjustments are aimed at hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies.The Office of the Actuary for Medicare and Medicaid Services questioned in an April 2010 report whether these levels of savings are realistic, saying that some health care providers would become unprofitable if payments were reduced. (The 60 Plus ad cites this report in its fine print.) The actuary's report suggests that Congress will intervene to change the payment formula to avoid health care providers dropping out of Medicare.The report also includes this caveat about how difficult it is to project the effects of the health care law: ""The legislation would result in numerous changes in the way that health care insurance is provided and paid for in the U.S., and the scope and magnitude of these changes are such that few precedents exist for use in estimation. Consequently, the estimates presented here are subject to a substantially greater degree of uncertainty than is usually the case with more routine health care legislation.""Finally, the 60 Plus ad also fails to mention new benefits for seniors under the health care law, such as a $250 rebate for prescription drugs purchased through Medicare Part D. (A statement on the 60 Plus website calls the drug rebate ""the senior suckup."") Currently, after an initial benefit period, enrollees are required to pay 100 percent of their prescription drug costs until they reach a level of catastrophic coverage. The rebate is meant to begin to close what is often called the doughnut hole in prescription drug coverage for beneficiaries. By 2020, Medicare will pay 75 percent of the total cost of generic prescription drug coverage in the gap, a marked improvement to the current program.Getting back to the Truth-O-Meter, the 60 Plus ad says that the new health care law ""will cut $500 billion from Medicare. That will hurt the quality of our care."" The ad loses points for accuracy because the $500 billion aren't actual cuts but reductions to future spending for a program that will still grow significantly in the next 10 years. The ad also says those cuts will ""hurt the quality"" of seniors' care. But we find that to be a highly contentious subject, and the 60 Plus ad doesn't hint at any of the ways that the reductions are ways to make Medicare more efficient. Finally, the ad doesn't mention any of the benefits to seniors, such as improved prescription drug coverage. The ad seems more intent on attacking the health care law than accurately describing this complicated piece of legislation. Because it leaves critical facts out of its description in a way that gives a misleading impression, we rate the statement Barely True.Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.Advertisement"

(Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)Last month, The Washington Post reported that white nationalists have begun using Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as a recruitment tool.Now, the polarizing Republican presidential front-runner has become the recruitment fodder for another group of marginalized extremists.A propaganda video released by the Somali-based al-Qaeda affiliate al-Shabab includes a clip of Trump calling on the United States to bar Muslims from entering the country, according to news reports. Trump made the statement following the Islamic State-inspired shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., last month.The video was produced to look similar to a documentary and calls upon African Americans to join a holy war against the United States, according to the BBC .[ Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Donald Trump ‘is ISIS’s greatest triumph’ ]Claiming the United States is a hotbed of racial inequality, police brutality and anti-Muslim sentiment, the film is an indictment of U.S. race relations and also includes historical civil rights-era footage of Malcolm X, an unnamed white supremacist and African Americans in prison, according to CNN .3) New #Shabaab vid shows #Trump proposing Muslim travel ban & Awlaki predicting bigotry & ""concentration camps"" pic.twitter.com/2KMpzYf3ui— Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 1, 2016The clip showing Trump, the BBC noted, arrives 10 minutes into the 51-minute propaganda video.On either side of the Trump footage, NBC reported , are clips of Anwar al-Awlaki, the late al-Qaeda recruiter, urging Muslims in the United States to move to Islamic countries or wage war against the West at home. A U.S. citizen, al-Awlaki was killed in a drone strike carried out in Yemen in 2011.“Yesterday, America was a land of slavery, segregation, lynching and Ku Klux Klan, and tomorrow, it will be a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps,” Awlaki can be heard saying in recorded footage.He adds: “The West will eventually turn against its Muslim citizens.”The al-Kataib Media Foundation released the video on Twitter on Friday, according to NBC.Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But Saturday afternoon, news of the video did nothing to dim the ardor of supporters gathering for his rally in Biloxi, Miss. They began lining up seven hours before the candidate was scheduled to speak, and they utterly rejected the premise that Trump was providing grist for propagandists.Some wondered whether the video was real. More insisted that the al-Qaeda affiliate was attacking Trump out of fear.“ISIS, Al-Shabaad, al-Qaeda, all those groups — they don’t want Trump in office,” said Richard Coyne, 52, an Army veteran from nearby Gulfport, who retired last year. “They want the status quo, which is unfortunately pro-ISIS, pro-Al-Qaeda, pro-Muslim.” ISIS is another name for the extremist group Islamic State.Sarah Anderson, 57, of Hattiesburg, also an Army veteran who had once worked at the checkpoint at the Berlin Wall, said that any terrorist group that cited Trump was doing so because it is “scared to death of him.”“He’s a threat to them,” she said. “That’s the opposite of promoting what the terrorists want.”Some voters were unaware of the video but well aware that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had warned of Trump’s rhetoric being promoted to recruit terrorists. Tom Simmons, a 68-year-old Vietnam War veteran from nearby Vancleave, was reminded of a time 45 years ago when liberals worried so much about winning hearts and minds that they did not do what was necessary for victory.“I can’t comprehend anything that the Democrats say,” Simmons said. “The terrorists fear Trump right now. They’re going to do anything they can to make him look ridiculous and sound ridiculous.”In controversial remarks made after the San Bernardino attack, Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.”[ Donald Trump would strongly consider closing some mosques in the United States ]The propaganda video includes that line, but bleeps out the word “hell,” according to CNN.In the wake of the Paris attacks, Trump said he would “strongly consider” shutting down some mosques and heavily surveilling others.“I would hate to do it, but it’s something that you’re going to have to strongly consider because some of the ideas and some of the hatred — the absolute hatred — is coming from these areas,” Trump said in an interview on “Morning Joe.”Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is saying Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton lied about him at Saturday's debate and is demanding an apology. (ABC News/NBC News)The video arrives on the heels of several heated exchanges between Trump and Hillary Clinton, in which Clinton has claimed Trump’s language aids jihadists.“If you go on Arabic television, as we have, and you look at what is being blasted out — video of Mr Trump being translated to Arabic,” Clinton said at an Iowa town hall last month. “ ‘No Muslims coming to the United States,’ other kinds of derogatory, defamatory statements — it is playing into the hands of the violent jihadists.”Trump’s comments, Clinton added, “lights an even bigger fire for them to make their propaganda claims through social media and in other ways.”[ Hillary Clinton revises contested claims about Islamic State recruiters using Donald Trump video ]Trump responded to Clinton’s assertion by calling her “a liar.”“It’s just another Hillary lie,” Trump said on NBC News’s “Meet the Press” late last month. “She’s a liar, and everybody knows that.”David Weigel contributed to this report from Biloxi, Miss.MORE READING:"

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/20/wayne-lapierre/wayne-lapierre-says-new-york-mayor-refused-nationa/	"	Says after Hurricane Sandy, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg ""refused to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns!"""	mostly false	['Guns', 'Public Safety']	http://dailycaller.com/	http://dailycaller.com/2013/02/13/stand-and-fight/	2013/02/20	TOPBy Wayne LaPierreBefore I tell you how the NRA and our members are going to Stand And Fight politically and in the courts, let’s acknowledge that all over this country, tens of millions of Americans are already preparing to Stand And Fight to protect their families and homes.These good Americans are prudently getting ready to protect themselves.It has always been sensible for good citizens to own and carry firearms for lawful protection against violent criminals who prey on decent people.During the second Obama term, however, additional threats are growing. Latin American drug gangs have invaded every city of significant size in the United States. Phoenix is already one of the kidnapping capitals of the world, and though the states on the U.S./Mexico border may be the first places in the nation to suffer from cartel violence, by no means are they the last.The president flagrantly defies the 2006 federal law ordering the construction of a secure border fence along the entire Mexican border. So the border today remains porous not only to people seeking jobs in the U.S., but to criminals whose jobs are murder, rape, robbery and kidnapping. Ominously, the border also remains open to agents of al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations. Numerous intelligence sources have confirmed that foreign terrorists have identified the southern U.S. border as their path of entry into the country.When the next terrorist attack comes, the Obama administration won’t accept responsibility. Instead, it will do what it does every time: blame a scapegoat and count on Obama’s “mainstream” media enablers to go along.A heinous act of mass murder—either by terrorists or by some psychotic who should have been locked up long ago—will be the pretext to unleash a tsunami of gun control.No wonder Americans are buying guns in record numbers right now, while they still can and before their choice about which firearm is right for their family is taken away forever.After Hurricane Sandy, we saw the hellish world that the gun prohibitionists see as their utopia. Looters ran wild in south Brooklyn. There was no food, water or electricity. And if you wanted to walk several miles to get supplies, you better get back before dark, or you might not get home at all.Anti-gun New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg had already done everything he could to prevent law-abiding New Yorkers from owning guns, and he has made sure that no ordinary citizen will ever be allowed to carry a gun. He even refused to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns!Meanwhile, President Obama is leading this country to financial ruin, borrowing over a trillion dollars a year for phony “stimulus” spending and other payoffs for his political cronies. Nobody knows if or when the fiscal collapse will come, but if the country is broke, there likely won’t be enough money to pay for police protection. And the American people know it.Hurricanes. Tornadoes. Riots. Terrorists. Gangs. Lone criminals. These are perils we are sure to face—not just maybe. It’s not paranoia to buy a gun. It’s survival. It’s responsible behavior, and it’s time we encourage law-abiding Americans to do just that.Since the election, millions of Americans have been lining up in front of gun stores, Cabela’s and Bass Pro Shops exercising their freedom while they still have it. They are demonstrating they have a mass determination to buy, own and use firearms. Millions of Americans are using market forces like never before to demonstrate their ardent support for our firearm freedoms. That’s one of the very best ways we can Stand And Fight.Inevitably, the anti-gun media and the gun-ban lobbies are demonizing the purchase of firearms. They call us “extremists” because we wonder whether we will be able to buy a semi-auto in three years or, even in some states, later this year. That’s despite the fact that President Obama long ago made clear that he wants to ban them all!The media try to make rank-and-file Americans feel guilty about buying a gun. The enemies of freedom demonize gun buyers and portray us as social lepers. But we know the truth. We know that responsible gun ownership exemplifies what is good and right about America.Responsible Americans realize that the world as we know it has changed. We, the American people, clearly see the daunting forces we will undoubtedly face: terrorists, crime, drug gangs, the possibility of Euro-style debt riots, civil unrest or natural disaster.Gun owners are not buying firearms because they anticipate a confrontation with the government. Rather, we anticipate confrontations where the government isn’t there—or simply doesn’t show up in time.To preserve the inalienable, individual human right to keep and bear arms—to withstand the siege that is coming—the NRA is building a four-year communications and resistance movement. The enemies of the Second Amendment will be met with unprecedented defiance, commitment and determination. We will Stand And Fight.First, we are going to devise legal capability like never before. I fervently hope that President Obama does not get to appoint another anti-gun Supreme Court justice like Sonia Sotomayor or Elena Kagan. But he probably will, and we must meet that challenge. His chances of appointing a replacement for one of the five pro-rights justices in the 5-4 Heller and McDonald majorities are high. And there’s no doubt he is going to appoint a huge number of new judges to lifetime positions in the lower federal courts.YOUR GUN RIGHTS ARE UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK!There has never been a more important time to join the NRA and now Daily Caller readers can enjoy special pricing and benefits.
http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2012/may/11/jennifer-williamson/do-we-really-spend-nearly-third-health-care-dollar/	"	Says ""One-third of our healthcare dollars go to wasteful insurance billing and bureaucracy."""	mostly true	['Health Care', 'Public Health']	http://voices.washingtonpost.com/	http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/07/administrative_costs_in_health.html	2012/05/11	"Tracking the Debate Over Health Care ReformMore on the EconomyPolitics, politicians, big business and the economyAdministrative Costs in Health Care: A PrimerI actually started looking into administrative costs a few weeks ago. But then, as if to prove the prescience of my research, Paul Krugman , Greg Mankiw , Tyler Cowen and a handful of others began arguing about the subject. And I'm not convinced any of them have it right.Administrative costs are one of the more confusing issues in health-care reform. Start with the term: What counts as an ""administrative cost"" for a health insurer? We all agree that paying bills counts. But does profit? What about disease management? Advertising? A nurse who dispenses health advice over the telephone?Hard to say. But all of them get grouped under administrative costs at various times. Indeed, I've spent the last few weeks looking into studies and talking to experts, and there's not perfect unanimity on how to measure any of this. But most seem to think that Medicare's administrative costs are significantly undersold in the public debate. An apples-to-apples comparison would not leave you with the 2 percent of total Medicare spending often bandied about in debate. That doesn't count, for instance, Medicare's premium collection, which is done through the tax code, and thus through the IRS. Nor does it count most of Medicare's billing, which is outsourced -- and this might surprise people -- to private insurers like Blue Cross Blue Shield and listed under vendor services rather than program administration. A more straightforward estimate, according to experts I've spoken to, would be in the range of 5 to 6 percent.Nor is it easy to measure administrative costs among private insurers. For one thing, which private insurers? When the Congressional Budget Office examined this issue, it found that administrative costs -- including advertising and profits -- accounted for 12 percent of the average insurer's dollar. But that hid substantial variation among insurers. Among employer-based plans, the largest firms had the lowest costs. Plans covering companies with at least 1,000 employees had a mere 7 percent in administrative costs. Those covering companies with fewer than 25 employees spent 26 percent of premiums on administration. And the individual market was a mess: 30 percent.This tells us a couple of things. First, size matters. The most important predictor of administrative costs is not whether the plan is public or private, but whether it is large. Second, the bulk of these costs are not helping humanity. Some conservative wags have been suggesting that Medicare's administrative costs are too low. But none of those wags, I'd wager, would prefer the small-group market to the large-group market. Others have argued that the difference in administration is that private insurers do an excellent job ferreting out fraud. unless you believe that only holds true for small business insurers, there's no evidence for that claim.Indeed, there's little argument that large-group insurance plans offer better value than small-group insurance plans. The reasons are obvious enough: Because they don't need to spend as much money on advertising or dealing with brokers or pricing the risk of applicants, large group insurers can spend more delivering efficient medical care. The administrative efficiencies are part of that.But administrative costs among payers -- that is to say, insurers -- are only part of the story. And they may not even be the most important part. The hospitals and physicians who have to deal with these payers are spending tremendous sums of money too. Hospitals have billing departments. They employ people to argue over claims and navigate the rules of the dozen or so different insurance plans they contract with. And here the experts were unanimous: The problem is that the system is fractured. There's no standardization. Remember the old Tolstoy quote, every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way? Well, every insurer is complicated in its own way. And that complexity costs a lot of money.As of now, no one I spoke with knew of good data separating the costs of dealing with Medicare and with private insurers. But there are studies comparing Canada and the United States that show a single payer vastly reduces administrative spending. Few think we could achieve those savings today, even if we did convert entirely to a single payer. But there's certainly a level of savings between here and there that we could reach.It's also important to note that you don't necessarily want administrative costs as low as they could possibly be. Some activities that are considered ""administrative"" are useful. Disease management, for instance, which accounts for some of the difference between Medicare and Medicare Advantage. Mental health counselors who are available by phone. Good-faith investigations into waste, fraud and abuse. Care coordination. Nurses who use e-mail or telephones to remind patients to take their drugs. Administration is not always wasteful.But no matter how good you got at slashing administrative costs, they will never be a panacea to the problems of the system. Rick Kronick, a political scientist at the University of California at San Diego, has done some of the best work on administrative costs, and he summed the situation up quite well. ""The main question,"" he said, ""is why are health care costs going up at 2.4 percent a year faster than GDP? And most of the answers to that question have nothing to do with administrative costs. The answers are that we do more stuff and have more technology. Even if we could wring administrative savings out of the system, which I'm all in favor of and would be a good thing, we'd still be facing the question of how to slow the rate of cost growth.""By Ezra Klein | July 7, 2009; 5:36 PM ET"

We'll talk with the owner of the town's biggest hotels and casinos, Steve Wynn, who decided a year ago, Las Vegas was a soft target.STEVE WYNN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, WYNN RESORTS: We profile or inspect or examine everybody that enters the building.WALLACE: Steve Wynn, only on ""Fox News Sunday.""And then, even gun rights advocates are calling to revoke bump stock, like the Las Vegas gunman used to make his automatic weapons fire faster.REP. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Fully automatic weapons have been outlawed for many, many years. This seems to be a way of going around that.WALLACE (on camera): Is this the start of sweeping gun control? We'll ask Chris Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Association.Plus, as President Trump decides to decertify the Iran nuclear deal, his, his secretary of state denies he is considered quitting.REX TILLERSON, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: The vice president has never had to persuade me to remain the secretary of state because I have never considered leaving this post.DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We must put an end to Iran's continued aggression and nuclear ambitions.WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel about the relationship between the president and Rex Tillerson as they weigh on a major policy change.And our power player of the week, a professional football player goes out of this world to make a difference.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My perspective shifted, I wanted to come home and really help inspire that next generation.WALLACE: All, right now, on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: And hello again from Fox News in Washington.We'll get the latest from the investigation into the Las Vegas mass shooting in a moment with a live report, but we begin with breaking news. Hurricane Nate made landfall early this morning striking Biloxi, Mississippi, with rain and winds of 85 miles per hour, causing flooding and power outages. Nate has now been downgraded to a tropical storm.Let's get the latest on Nate's path. Chief meteorologist Rick Reichmuth is in the Fox Weather Center in New York -- Rick.RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS CHIEF METEOROLOGIST: Hi, Chris.Yes, the fourth hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. this hurricane season, which is quite remarkable. Taking a look at the satellite picture, you can see it moved onshore. It still is moving very quickly, which is great news. It means it's not going to sit in any one spot, and allow it to rain for that long.So, the flooding won't be as bad as it could have been. That said, over time, this is going to pull up in across parts of the Tennessee Valley, Ohio Valley, and eventually, across parts of the Northeast because it's interacting with a cold front coming in. It's going to bring a lot of moisture out.So, this is the future radar. Throughout the day today, rain moving in the North Georgia mountains, Tennessee Valley, in toward the Central Appalachia, during the overnight hours. And by tomorrow, all of that moisture moves in across parts of the Northeast. So, a very wet start to the week and a wet commute to the day tomorrow as well.But take a look at this -- overall rainfall totals are going to be extreme. Some spots potentially up to 10 inches, far inland from the storm. That means flooding could be widespread especially across parts of the central and southern Appalachians -- Chris.WALLACE: Rick, thank you.Now to Las Vegas where investigators are still looking for a motive into why Stephen Paddock open fire on a crowd last Sunday night, killing 58 people and wounding almost 500.Will Carr is live in Las Vegas with the latest -- Will.WILL CARR, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Chris, authorities say, as Stephen Paddock was perched on the 30-second floor of Mandalay Bay, he left a note on his nightstand. Now, ""60 Minutes"" reporting that note had calculations so he could maximize his accuracy as he fired down upon the crowd. And when that happened, thousands scattered, people raced over in this direction, they physically pushed down this fence and then they ran over unto airport property, trying to get to safety.And while questions continue to swirl around motive, authorities are putting out billboards across town, asking for help. There are also reports that the FBI is starting to believe Paddock had severe mental illness that went undiagnosed.Fifty-eight people were killed in the attacks, almost 500 injured before Paddock shot and killed himself. Investigators are continuing to question Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley. We've learned the couple traveled and went on at least a dozen cruises.As the investigation continues, this community continues to try to heal. Vice President Mike Pence took part in a community prayer walk on Saturday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We do more with those who mourn and grieve with those who grieve, but we do not grieve like those who have no hope, because heroes give us hope.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)CARR: Along those lines, a carpenter drove into town from Chicago and he put up 58 wooden crosses, on each cross is a victim's picture and their name. Really a touching reminder of all the people's lives that were lost -- Chris.WALLACE: Will Carr reporting from Las Vegas -- Will, thanks.The Las Vegas massacre raises new questions about how to prevent these attacks.Joining me now for an exclusive interview, one of the giants of Las Vegas, Steve Wynn, chief executive of Wynn Resorts, who's been thinking about this problem for a long time.Steve, it was over a year ago when you said that Las Vegas was a target city and you were going to harden your hotels and casinos. What did you do?WYNN: Actually, it was two years ago Thanksgiving, and I got every consultant and adviser I can think of to come through from a Ray Kelly to the people from Seal Team 6. It took us from Thanksgiving until May to develop and institute and recruit a program of counterterrorism and it will be two years this May.WALLACE: And --WYNN: It started in 2015.WALLACE: And without going into great detail, what kind of things do you have on your facilities?WYNN: Basically we had to recruit and expand security by tens of millions of dollars to cover every entrance, to retrain the entire workforce, from housekeeping and room service, and people are in the tower and observing people. We had to cover every exit and every aspect of the building to see if we could identify and preempt any kind of terroristic or violent action.It is never perfect, of course, but what you can do to use local vernacular, you can change the odds, I guess.WALLACE: So, given all of that -- and I know that you had a hidden metal detectors and you had profilers in your casinos, watching the people walking in and out -- would any of those measures have prevented Steven Paddock from checking in to one of your hotels instead of the Mandalay Bay to have brought in these suitcases carrying his arsenal, a couple of suitcases at that time, checking in to a room on a high floor, knocking out the window and raining terror down on people below?WYNN: Well, I know that my friends at MGM are particularly fastidious about trying to protect their employees and their guests. Having said that, there are a couple of things in retrospect and it's always good to look over your shoulder on these things. But we have a routine with housekeeping, with room service, with audio visual, who anybody that goes in the room to do an inspection.We also have rules about do not disturb. If a room goes on ""do not disturb"" for more than 12 hours, we investigate. We constantly -- we don't allow guns in this building unless they're being carried by our employees and there's a lot of them. But if anybody's got a gun and we find them continually, we eject them from the hotel.WALLACE: So, if he had suitcases carrying these automatic -- or semi-automatic weapons, would you have been able to spot that if they were in the suitcases being carried up to his room?WYNN: Well, we certainly wouldn't invade the privacy of a guest in a room. But let's put it this way, the scenario that we're aware of would have indicated that he didn't let anyone in the room for two or three days, that would have trigger a whole bunch of alarms here. And we would have -- on behalf of the guests, of course, investigated for safety and it would have been provocative situation.I'm sure that the same is true in other hotels but in this hotel, a 36-hour, a 24-hour, 36-hour ""do not disturb"" one of room is a predicate for investigation.WALLACE: After the shooting last weekend, you started having security at the entrances to your hotels, wand people, wand -- inspect bags being brought in, are you going to keep doing that? And with 20/20 hindsight the benefit there, have you thought of new measures that you're going to take to try to prevent another one of these massacres from happening using one of the Wynn Resorts as a perch to fire down on thousands of people on the street below?WYNN: Well, if I can clear the record, we have been guarding the doors for two years every single day, 24 hours a day. We have magnetometers at any place, at every employee entrance, and at every place of human collection like the night clubs. We don't wand the people at the door. That's not necessary.We profile or inspect or examine everybody that enters the building. And under most circumstances, it's unnecessary to wand people or to do any kind of invasive procedure. The things we're looking for that represent potential threats are much more obvious and allow us a great deal of freedom in allowing us to not interfere with the normal flow of people in and out of the building, which is close to 15,000 or 20,000 people a day.WALLACE: I understand that Stephen Paddock had gambled and stayed at your properties along with a lot of other places along the Strip. I know you talked to your security team afterwards.Looking back, after talking to all of them, how much of a profile did you have on him? And was there anything in that profile that should have raise a red flag?WYNN: It's an interesting question. He's been staying in Las Vegas since '06. So, you know, we're talking about 11 years, with his girlfriend or at least in recent years. Frequent visitor, once or twice a month to this hotel and others.The most vanilla profile one could possibly imagine. A modest gambler at least by our standards, you know, nothing serious, paid promptly, never owed any money anywhere in Las Vegas. He didn't fit the profile of a problem or a compulsive gambler.What was -- if there was anything interesting that we discovered in the years of service and we have butlers and waiters and masseuses and the people in the beauty shop that know this woman and this man completely. They talk about normal mundane things. But if there's anything interesting that stood out over the six years, nobody that's ever worked here have ever seen the gentleman or the lady take a drink of wine, beer or alcohol of any kind.Now, a lot of people don't drink. But considering their frequency of all the restaurants, and their behavior as normal tourist taking advantage of everything that's available in our resort, they never ever imbibed in any liquor. Their behavior was conservative, private, understated in every way. You never ever would stop a man like this coming in, you know, in the building.However, nobody in this company's history, no public person has ever walked in the service elevator unless they were accompanied by a security. That wouldn't happen. Secondly --WALLACE: Did he go on a service elevator, Steve?WYNN: I'm just saying anything like that. I'm not sure whether he did, but nobody ever goes in the back of the house unaccompanied by security.But another thing, being in a room for three days in a ""do not disturb"" situation, that would have triggered an alarm here, and would have considered -- what have been considered as a potentially dangerous thing from the guest's point of view that maybe the person was ill. And we would want to inspect and see that they were safe. We go into their room. We'd want to know more about anybody who was sequestered in a room for more than 12 hours. That would be -- that would be something that would -- our people have been trained too look out for.So, Chris --WALLACE: Steve, you and I have known each other for some years. You are very smart man who knows almost everything, has seen almost every aspect of human conduct, do you have a theory, do you have an instinct for the big question: why Steven Paddock did what he did?WYNN: No. No. But I have this feeling, Chris. This is a man who behaves rationally, privately, a little introverted, liked to play video poker. But he was a rational man. And every historical review of his behavior indicates that he was a rational man, so was his girlfriend. And yet, he prepared over an extended period of time, a totally irrational act.Now, this sounds like someone either totally demented -- a behavior which he never evidenced -- or someone who's sending a message. This is a plan. We don't know what that message is or if there is one, but this behavior, according to my employees, is as stunning as unexpected as anybody, any of them have ever met.And that's the status, you know, that I hear from the sheriff, and watching television that seems to be the moment -- the momentary analysis of this situation. I really don't have anything to add to that.WALLACE: Steven Wynn, thank you. Thank for you time. And we'll be watching how you and the rest of Las Vegas respond to this terrible tragedy. Thanks again, sir.WYNN: We'll be fine. We'll be fine. The president did a good job.WALLACE: Up next, after still another mass shooting, the debate over gun control re-ignites. But this time, even the National Riffle Association is calling for more regulation. We'll talk with the NRA's executive director when we come right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: In the wake of last Sunday's mass murder in Las Vegas, we all followed an all-too-familiar pattern: shocked, questions, and calls for more gun control. Most of us also learned about a device, bump stock, that allow rifles to fire faster. And now, even some of the strongest advocates of gun rights are calling for more regulation.Joining me here is Chris Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Association.Mr. Cox, welcome to ""Fox News Sunday.""CHRIS COX, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION: Thanks, Chris.WALLACE: The NRA surprised a lot of people this week, calling for ATF to review bump stocks.Here is part of your statement. Let's put it on the screen: The NRA believes devices designed to allow semiautomatic rifles to function like fully automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.This regulation had been on the books for seven years, why is the NRA suddenly concerned, and what specifically would you like to see ATF do?COX: Well, what we called for was ATF to review any device changes semiautomatics to function like fully automatics. As you probably know, it's illegal to convert a semiautomatic to fully automatic. ATF did approve this under Barack Obama.And what the National Rifle Association has said is ATF needs to do their job, review these, and if there's a further regulation, then we'll work on further regulation. But, Chris, what we saw last week was pure evil, and we've seen evil existed in this country. We've seen box cutters in airplanes, cars, bombs, trucks full of explosives, and yes firearms.So, as we have this conversation, we need to look at the broader picture. We need to have an honest discussion about what works and what doesn't work, and our concern is that all this focus on devices takes away the attention from the underlying behavior. And until we address that, these things are going to continue to happen.WALLACE: Well, let's just talk about the underlying behavior. You're the NRA, so we're going to talk to you about the specific technique. Would you be OK with banning bump stocks?COX: Well, we don't believe that bans have ever worked on anything. What we've said has been very clear, that if something transfers a semiautomatic to function like a fully automatic, then it ought to be regulated differently. Fully automatics are regulated differently in this country. If something copies a semiautomatic into a fully automatic, then those should be related as well.WALLACE: Did you get any blowback from some of your members? Because it's unusual for the NRA, after one of these incidents to call for more regulation of either guns or parts of guns.COX: There were NRA members at that concert. There were NRA members that were shot at that concert, and NRA members that were murdered at that concert. So, what we're getting from NRA members is grief and fear, the same way Americans are grieving and scared that something like this might happen again.So, will there be disagreement over policy discussions? Of course. There's an ongoing discussion of gun control in this country. We had it during the debates last year. We had it throughout the campaign when the most pro-gun control candidate was defeated by the most pro-Second Amendment candidate.These conversations happened. What we are concerned about is that we're having a conversation when people are grieving, there used to be a common decency in this country where people pause from talking about policy.Unfortunately, with Dianne Feinstein and Michael Bloomberg, they want to exploit a tragedy from day. It's shameful. But apparently, that's the new normal and that's why we're talking to you today.WALLACE: Well, I want to pick up on that, because while the NRA is talking about bump stocks, there are number of gun control advocates, a number of them Democrats who are calling for more sweeping measures. Here's a few.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I can't believe one whole political party in the greatest country on earth is totally sold to the gun lobby.REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALI., HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: They're going to say, if you give them a bump stock, it's going to be a slippery slope -- I certainly hope so.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Now, I know that sets your teeth on edge.You say common decency, let's wait. What's enough time? I mean, here where 58 people killed, almost 500 injured, is it common decency to wait a day, two days, a week, a month?I mean, it is understandable. You can -- I know you don't agree with their solution, but what's wrong with saying we need to address this issue?COX: Well, let me talk about Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi both and get back to that point. You can see Pelosi has said, and I take her at her word, I take Dianne Feinstein at her word when she says that she had 51 votes in the Senate for Mr. and Ms. America to turn in all of your guns, they would do it.Look, the talking points might change for Dianne Feinstein, but the underlying agenda never does.And the truth is, Hillary Clinton ran as a most pro-gun control candidate in America and she lost. And -- but she gets an award, she gets an award for hypocrisy, because she will never spend a moment, a breath, without armed security surrounding her for the rest of her life, she will never dial 911, she'll never lived in a high crime area, but her life is no more valuable than a single mom living in Chicago, working the late shift, who wants to own a gun and carry it to defend herself.That's why we're calling on Congress to yes, look at firearms, but also --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: I want to pick up on that and I'm going to throw a little monkey wrench at the control room because we're going to play an earlier bite, because you and I talked earlier this weekend and you said that you want to have a sensible conversation about gun control.Wayne LaPierre, the head of NRA, talked this week and I want to play a clip from what he said. Here he is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WAYNE LAPIERRE, CEO, NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION: One thing the American public always knows, that the elites always protect themselves and they always protect themselves with guns, and they lecture the American public how you shouldn't do that.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: The reason I pick up on that is because you are in effect with saying the same thing about every Clinton. Is that a sensible way to have this conversation, to try to turn it into class warfare where you're for gun control, somehow you're part of an elite?COX: It's not class warfare. Chris, it's what the American people want. The American people want to protect themselves. They want to be able to defend themselves. Yes, we're willing to have a conversation --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: But, wait, no -- that's actually -- that's not actually true. I mean, yes, Second Amendment, but if you talk about background checks, if you talk about automatic weapon -- well, let me just say that. There are a lot of people, in fact a majority of people, according to the polls, would like to see those gun controls.I'm just -- I have to say I'm put off at the argument that if you believe in gun control, you're an elite. I have to tell you, Mr. Cox, I know very few people outside of public officials -- she was a former first lady, she was former secretary of state -- who have armed bodyguards. One of the few people I know, private people, who has armed bodyguards is Wayne LaPierre.COX: Chris, as a law-abiding gun owner, I am armed security. But I couldn't bring a gun into Washington, D.C., because my license gun, because they won't allow me to protect myself.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: That's not my point, sir.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: My point is -- no, my point is you cannot have a gun and you can believe in gun control because you think it's dangerous. Now, we can argue about the merits of it, but I think to dismiss people and say, well, that's just the elite and they have armed guards is, it seems to me, does a disservice to your argument.COX: It's the hypocrisy that bothers the American people, Chris. It's the hypocrisy coming out of Hollywood. It's the hypocrisy coming out of politicians, and it's the hypocrisy coming out of a lot of people in the media who refused to accept that law-abiding people in between New York and Los Angeles, and in between Washington, D.C., and Miami deserve the right to defend themselves. That's what the National Rifle Association exists for.And, look, we can talk about background checks. This murderer in Las Vegas passed them. So did the gentleman or the murderer in Orlando, Tucson, Aurora, Fort Hood --WALLACE: Let's talk about background checks and let's talk about specific issues, because you're certainly right, he did pass them and he brought all these guns legally. There is a 72-hour limit on background checks, and as a result, some people call that the Charleston loophole because Dylann Roof, the man who bought a gun through a background check and then killed nine people in a church, you can see his picture there, he got the gun because the background check wasn't complete in 72 hours even though he would have failed that background check.Question for you, Mr. Cox, when it's a matter of life and death, and I understand, you don't want background checks to go on forever, that's not appropriate. But when it's a matter of life and death, couldn't it be four days or five days and not three days and he gets his gun?COX: Sure, the National Rifle Association has worked to include every mental health record, every court adjudication, every criminal record to make sure that people don't fall through the cracks. The National Rifle Association --WALLACE: That's not -- that's not true, sir.COX: That's absolutely true, Chris.WALLACE: No, it isn't. Forgive me -- in February, President Trump signed a measure that said that the Social Security Administration no longer has to provide information on mental disorders to the national background criminal check and the NRA supported that.COX: That is a complete misrepresentation of our position, a complete misrepresentation of what President Trump did. What he said is you can't arbitrarily deny a senior citizen their Second Amendment rights based on no finding of dangerousness. The only finding was that they asked somebody to help them manage their financial affairs.If you think that somebody needing help with a checkbook should eliminate them from exercising their Second Amendment, then you under --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Mental disorders -- now, I agree, it wasn't everybody. It was some people with mental disorders and you backed that.COX: Their definition of a mental disorder was someone who asked for help handling their finances. That is not a prohibitive category, Chris, and it shouldn't be a prohibitive category.WALLACE: Let me ask you about another measure that has been talked about, and before I do, I want you to just watch this video. Here it is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stay down.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: You hear that gunfire. One reason that Stephen Paddock was able to fire so quickly, so many shots so quickly was because he had a high-capacity magazine, he had a bunch of them that held between 60 and 100 rounds.Now, I understand Second Amendment, Supreme Court has ruled on it. Why do you need a magazine that holds 100 rounds?COX: There's no one in America who watches that video that's not horrified. And NRA members that were at that concert I'm sure were more horrified than you and I were.And so, the question, and it's a fair question and it's to ask, if banning me from owning these sorts of things would prevent a criminal for going out and misusing them, that is a fair question. And what you have to do is look at, what has Congress done? Congress banned semiautomatics and high-capacity magazines for 10 years, 10 years. And Bill Clinton's own Justice Department said it had no impact on crime.California still bans those magazines, but it didn't prevent San Bernardino or Santa Barbara. In Europe, there's virtually entire bans on everything, but it didn't stop murderers using machine guns -(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: We're running out of time, sir. But even when you see that horrific video and he is firing this (ph) because of the bump stocks and it's because of the magazines that he is able to fire 100 rounds in a few seconds, less than a minute. No qualms about allowing people? Let me flip it around, why should, in 30 seconds if you will, why do shooters need people to hunt, to protect themselves, why do they need magazines with 100 rounds in them?COX: People need -- first of all, it's intentionally designed to scare people. People own magazines of different capacities for different reasons.WALLACE: You know, 10 rounds would be enough?COX: It depends on what you have it for. It depends on what you have it for. People can own things safely and responsibly and be a danger to no one. And that's the part of this conversation. It can't be a fair and balance conversation if you're not willing to discuss the broader problems that we have with the violent culture coming out of Hollywood, with video games that fundamentally change how military simulators work.WALLACE: Mr. Cox, it's obviously -- we didn't agree. We're going to settle this in this short period of time. Thank you so much for coming in today. Please come back and we'll continue the conversation.COX: I'll look forward to it. Thanks, Chris.WALLACE: Hopefully not as another one of these terrible tragedies.Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss where things stand in the debate over gun control.Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about chances for new gun laws in the wake of the Las Vegas massacre. Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and we may use your question on the air.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Coming up, Secretary of State Tillerson knocks down reports he considered quitting.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE: I serve at the appointment of thee president and I am here for as long as the president feels I can be useful to achieving his objectives.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel about the relationship between President Trump and Rex Tillerson, coming up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Apparently this allows you to take a semiautomatic, turn it into a fully automatic. So clearly that's something that we need to look into.SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, D-CALIFORNIA: I hope senators will finally summon the political courage to stand up and say, enough is enough.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Some rare bipartisan agreement this week from Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein and House Speaker Paul Ryan, at least on the issue of bump stocks.And it's time now for our Sunday group.Former National Security Council staffer Gillian Turner, columnist for The Hill, Juan Williams, Julie Pace, Washington bureau chief for The Associated Press, and Tom Rogan of The Washington Examiner.Julie, what do you make of Republicans like Paul Ryan saying that they want to take a look at bump stocks? Is this the beginning of a conversation, a broader conversation, of gun controls, or are they trying to limit it to this one device, which is so hard to defend?JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: I'm not sure we're going to see any broader conversation on gun control. I think the fact that Republicans and the NRA came out -- the White House as well -- came out and expressed an openness on bump stocks is certainly an interesting development because we rarely even see Republicans go after some of the low-hanging fruit on this gun control debate here.I think that there's going to be a reluctance on the part of GOP lawmakers to go any further on that. Certainly the NRA would push back pretty aggressively if they started to do that. But I think on this issue, look, there's not a huge constituency for bump stocks. I think most people can agree that if you're going to take a device, put it on a semi -- a legal semiautomatic weapon and turn it into a fully automatic weapon, that that's something that needs to be addressed. You have unanimity on that across the political spectrum.WALLACE: We asked you for question for the panel, and on this issue of gun control in the wake of the Las Vegas massacre, Rick Reuss tweeted this, what conceivable gun legislation could have prevented the evil that occurred in Las Vegas?Tom as Chris Cox of the NRA pointed out, Stephen Paddock bought all these guns legally, he passed all the background checks. So how do you answer Rick.TOM ROGAN, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Well, I think the broader point here is that whether we're talking about this particular incident of gun violence or the broader issue of terrorism in the age of ISIS, and I'm not drawing connection between the two points, but the relevance of potential mass casualty events makes them similar in terms of issue. You could, for example, put in checkpoint at every major public event, at every major hotel. You could have personal inspections. But the ultimate problem comes down to what measure of freedom of movement, ease of movement, are you willing to give up in return for a greater measure of security? And, ultimately, that fixes right back to the Second Amendment debate.I suspect what we will see here, if you look at the two most recent Supreme Court cases on the Second Amendment, Heller and McDonnell, there's actually quite a lot of wiggle room there for local governments, especially when it comes to the public carrying element to do things. So I think it's going to down (ph) fast.WALLACE: Yes, we should point that out. I did an interview some years ago with Antonin Scalia, who wrote the Heller decision, and he specifically said there is an unfettered right to the Second Amendment, but that doesn't mean there can't be gun controls, reasonable, sensible ones that don't infringe.All right, let's turn to another hot topic. The Trump administration, on Friday, announced broad, new exceptions to the Obamacare mandates on birth control. The insurance plans have to provide contraception coverage to their employees. Here was President Trump earlier talking about religious freedom.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: WE are ending the attack son your religious liberty and we are proudly reaffirming America's leadership role as a nation that protects religious freedom for everyone.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Gillian, the religious right is delighted with this, the president's decision, and he's made several in this regard to say that employers, for reasons either of religion or moral beliefs are not to be forced to provide birth control, contraception, to their employees. On the other hand, women's groups are incensed by this decision.GILLIAN TURNER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: And groups on the right look at this as a victory, but I would caution the president and all Republicans that chipping away at the Affordable Care Act, executive order -- one executive order at a time is going to be an awfully painful exercise over the next few years.If we look at what Chuck Schumer said to the president last week over the phone, which was allegedly repeal and replace is now dead for the final time --WALLACE: Well, let me back up -- and just for folks who don't follow it like we do. the president and Schumer talked and the president talked about maybe we can do a deal with the Democrats and then Schumer said --TURNER: And then Schumer said, Mr. President, repeal and replacing Obamacare is officially dead. It died its last death a couple of weeks ago. If we take him at his word, the president really has two paths forward. One is, reforming Obamacare through executive action, which is the option I refer to is going to be incredibly painful for everybody involved. You can also try and cut a deal with Dems.I think the president is showing this week, this past week, that he's trying to pursue both those options at once. I mean maybe he'll forge a certain degree of success with congressional Democrats on this, but he's not going to get a deal that's going to replace -- repeal and replace Obamacare. Whatever way we look at this going forward, because of the Republicans failure to get this done for the president, it's going to be painful for him.WALLACE: Juan, I want to pick up on this because I'm curious about the politics of it. On the one hand, look, the president promised this on the campaign trail. He's keeping a promise that helped get him elected. On the other hand, if you look at the polls, most people support the idea of the provision of contraception. So, you know, he's pleasing his base but he's turning off a majority of voters.JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, but he's pleasing his base. And it's an interesting political dynamic here, Chris, because he's not only pulling the contraception mandate, but he's also pulling money for the promotion of Obamacare and to enroll people at this point. So he's actively trying to undermine Obamacare, I think, to make the case to Schumer and the Democrats, this is imploding and you're going to come to me to want to make a deal to try to rescue it. I think that is his bargaining position is, with regard to the politics with the base, the base has no wall, they have no Obamacare repeal, they have a debt deal with Chuck and Nancy, if you'll recall. I think there's a little bit of anxiety inside that White House with Steve Bannon gone about making sure that you are always playing to the base.But I worry that it's less catering at this point than pandering to people who are, I think, misinformed about the consequences. It's almost like Trump is now saying, you know what, yes, we didn't get done what we promised you, conservative base, but we are still actively here trying to drain the swamp or disrupt things. Well, has your life improved? That's what Ronald Reagan asked. Is your life better off today than it was when I -- when --WALLACE: Well, that's not a rhetorical question.WILLIAMS: No.WALLACE: Some people would say the economy's doing pretty well.WILLIAMS: Oh, yes. And we lost jobs for the first time because of a hurricane --WALLACE: Yes, have you -- have you heard of Harvey and Irma?WILLIAMS: Yes, but have you heard, first time in seven years? Have you heard about a tax cut deal that benefits the rich disproportionately, not the blue collar worker? I think people will have to get that information at some point.WALLACE: Tom.ROGAN: I think corporate tax reform. This is one of the things that I think the president deserves courage on and House Republican leaders. It is not fashionable in the age of Bernie Sanders to say, corporate tax reform. But if you speak to economists, investment productivity, that is the key.WALLACE: I have to say, only on our panel do we go from birth control to corporate tax reform without missing a beat.We have to take a break here.Up next, will President Trump decertify the Iran nuclear deal this week? And what about his relationship with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You guys know what this represents?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE).TRUMP: I don't know, maybe it's the calm before the storm.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What storm, Mr. President?TRUMP: You'll find out.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: President Trump raising a lot of questions during a photo-op with his top military brass, and we're back now with the panel.Well, one thought about a possible storm is that the president may, and in fact is expected, to announce this week that he will decertify the Iran deal, say that it's no longer in the national interest. But that doesn't end the deal. It then goes to Congress and the Congress has 60 days to decide whether or not they are going to re-impose the sanctions that were lifted as part of the deal. And if they don't do that, then, guess what, we're still in the deal, which raises the question, Gillian, what would that have (ph) step (ph)? He decertifies but the sanctions stay lifted. What would that accomplish?TURNER: Well, it's a sort of middle ground for the president, which is why maybe he's going to go in this direction. It's a middle ground in that it doesn't kill the deal, but it passes the buck to Congress. So the first reason I think the president is not going to recertify is that he enjoys nothing more than passing the buck to Congress, making them make these hard decisions, like we saw with DACA. What will happen if he does not recertify Iran's compliance with the JCPOA on October 15th --WALLACE: Which is the Iran deal.TURNER: The Iran deal. It hands it to Congress and they have 60 days to debate and then make their own decision via a vote.The second reason I don't think he's going to recertify is that the albatross around his neck at this moment is every 90 days he's got to very publicly sign an agreement that shows Iran has been complying with this deal. It is something that is a thorn in his side on the foreign policy spectrum like nothing else. It is an Obama -- from President Trump's perspective, this is an Obama-era legacy he --WALLACE: So once he decertifies, he's off that hook?TURNER: He's just itching, itching to free himself from that.PACE: This is exactly what we've heard, that it's the act of having to certify every 90 days, that Trump actually has to sign a certification that is driving him crazy. That that is one of the driving factors in this debate, which is pretty amazing, actually.WALLACE: Defense Secretary Mattis testified before Congress this week and he was asked the key question on this matter.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. ANGUS KING, I-MAINE: Do you believe it's in our national security interest at the present time to remain in the JCPOA? That's a ""yes"" or ""no"" question.JAMES MATTIS, DEFENSE SECRETARY: Yes, senator, I do.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: You can tell how excited Secretary Mattis was to have to answer that question.Juan, the president is apparently going against almost his entire senior national security team in making this decision to decertify. Why do you think that is?WILLIAMS: Well, I think he's playing to the base. We were talking about this a moment ago. But I think that this is a very aggressive step to say, listen to the base. I promised you during the campaign that I would get rid of this Iran deal. I said it was the worst deal ever for the United States, it was a rip-off, and I am going to act on my campaign promise because it's not only his inner circle -- and there's lots of reports this week that, you know, Tillerson called him a moron and all that, but also that Tillerson, Kelly, Mattis have some kind of suicide pact where they said, you know, if he fires any one of us, we're all going. But that they are there because, in the word of Bob Corker, the head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a Republican, they act as a buffer. They are stopping chaos in terms of our foreign policy from becoming imposed by the president. It's a very intriguing situation. But the president, I think in this instance, is playing to the base one more.WALLACE: Yes, we should point out, those were the views of senator -- or the statement of Senator Corker, not of the --WILLIAMS: Yes.WALLACE: OK.Speaking of splits between the president and top advisers, let's talk about this split with Rex Tillerson. There was a report this week that Tillerson had seriously considered quitting over the summer and that at one point, not to be president, but to some other people he called the president a moron. That led to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE: It continues to be misreported. There has never been a consideration in my mind to leave.DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have a very good relationship. We disagree on a couple of things. Sometimes I'd like him to be a little bit tougher. But other than that, we have a very good relationship.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Other than that, I think, my (INAUDIBLE) --PACE: I mean that point nearly is the kiss of death from (INAUDIBLE).WALLACE: What's really going on here, and is Tillerson out or not?PACE: So this has been a complicated relationship for a long time. Months ago I had a senior administration official tell me that Trump likes the idea of Tillerson, the businessman, the Texas swagger, more than he actually liked Tillerson himself. He really gets annoyed at the way Tillerson handles himself in meetings. He doesn't like the idea that Tillerson, especially on this North Korea issue, has been pushing this idea of diplomacy, which he is the nation's top diplomat. That is, in general, what he is supposed to do.So this is highly complicated. Tillerson has been frustrated by being undermined by presidential tweets. He's been frustrated that Jared Kushner has picked up a large part of the foreign policy portfolio. And the big challenge for Tillerson right now -- and I think the thing that I've heard that he is going to have to decide about in terms of his future here is, what kind of juice does he have left with foreign government? When he is traveling around the world, when he is meeting with foreign leaders and he says this is a position of the United States government, do they believe him anymore? And, frankly, talking to diplomats around town, they don't always believe him.WALLACE: I want to pick up on exactly that point with you, Tom, because whether Tillerson stays or not, you would think that his effectiveness as secretary of state has been dramatically diminished. Leaders around the world are watching all this play out. And we've seen the president, in the case of North Korea, as soon as Tillerson said in China last week that we have avenues to talk to North Korea, the president tweeted, don't waste your time, Rex. I mean --ROGAN: It's unity of message, stupid, would be the foreign policy equivalent of the famous line. And that is so critical here because, you know, as Julie suggests, when foreign diplomats hear from American diplomats -- not just about Tillerson, right, it's about all the Foreign Service officers in every embassy around the world. If they are having those lunch meetings with foreign officials and journalists and they are not seen as credible, in line with the president, it's a huge problem. But it's also a huge problem for President Trump in the sense that if you talk about the Iran deal now, with that short window if he decertifies effectively to get the French crucially on board, who may come on board with him about reforming the deal, if they don't trust the only guy who's in the room in Paris with them, Secretary of State Tillerson, their willingness to say to all their domestic manufacturers who have those nice deals in Iran, hey, by the way, we're going to push on this, but those manufacturers say then, well, you're talking to Tillerson. Trump is tweeting, Tillerson's an idiot. That -- that -- that -- that -- that is very hard diplomacy.WALLACE: You've got about 30 seconds.TURNER: If I -- if I may. I believe Secretary Tillerson's future hinges on whether or not he did call President Trump a moron. And I mean this in a very specific sense. If he did, it will ultimately be made known to the president. It is a fireball offense for any secretary of state throughout the course of U.S. history. I'm including people like Henry Kissinger here.It is not something a secretary of state can survive. And so all of the policy issues, all of the disagreement will fall by the wayside and it will come down to whether or not there is proof that he spoke about the president (INAUDIBLE).WALLACE: All right, I've got -- I've got 10 seconds. Did he call him a moron or not?PACE: I personally have not confirmed it, but I will say, I had someone point out, that he's an Eagle Scout and he did not specifically deny it in his press conference.WALLACE: Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday. That's -- Boy Scouts.Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week."" From the football field to outer space, how a former astronaut is using his story to inspire others.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Only 362 Americans have had the chance to fly into space. But one astronaut is using his unique path there to inspire young people on their own journeys. Here's our ""Power Player of the Week.""(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)LELAND MELVIN, AUTHOR, ""CHASING SPACE"": No matter where you come from, no matter what zip code you're in, you know, with grit, with grace and perseverance and a lot of second chances, you can do anything you put your mind to.WALLACE: Leland Melvin has gone to remarkable places, including 374 orbits of our planet. But it's his journey to get there that's the real story.MELVIN: My mother gave me a chemistry set when I was probably seven or eight years old. It was a non-OSHA certified, age inappropriate chemistry set where I created the most incredible explosion in her living room.WALLACE: Melvin was hooked. He played football and won at scholarship to the University of Richmond as a wide receiver. But that was never his passion.MELVIN: I didn't watch, you know, Monday night football on the NFL. I was doing chemistry labs. So it wasn't something that was my favorite thing. But it was -- it was something that got me to college.WALLACE: Football did more than that. He was drafted to play in the NFL, but even trying out for the Dallas Cowboys was a balancing act.MELVIN: By day I'm catching footballs for America's team with Danny White and all these people, Hershel Walker. And at night I'm watching material science engineering videotapes. And that was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.WALLACE: A hamstring injury ended his football career. Melvin went back to school, got his masters and became a research scientist at NASA. Then, in 1998, he applied to be an astronaut.MELVIN: Only a few of us have been in the NFL and been engineers at NASA and scientists at NASA. And so I think that kind of differentiated me from some of the other candidates.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, and liftoff of Space Shuttle Atlantis.WALLACE: In 2008, Melvin went on the first of two shuttle missions. His role, operating the robotic arm to install a lab on the International Space Station. But he says orbiting the earth every 90 minutes made a more profound impression.MELVIN: You're connected to everyone as you go around the planet. And so it's one of these things where my perspective shifted. I wanted to come home and really help inspire that next generation.WALLACE: At a book fair in Washington this summer, Melvin shared his life lesson.MELVIN: Opportunities come to you, but you have to be prepared for that opportunity. And having that one person in your life, all you need is one, that has your back and believes in you.WALLACE: There's a big push these days for kids to study STEM, science, technology, engineering, and math. But Melvin talks about STEAM, adding thee Arts.MELVIN: If you say that STEM is the most important thing, then you're leaving out the artists and the musicians and the creators that are -- that are truly part of anything that you're designing or building.WALLACE: Melvin's book is called ""Chasing Space,"" featuring a photo that's gone viral at him and his two dogs. What he wants is for young people to chase blank, whatever their passion is.MELVIN: When I share the story, I share the experiences, and a kid who was on a path of going maybe nowhere sees a spark and looks up in the night sky and one day I may watch them in my rocking chair heading off to Mars, that's what gets me so stoked.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: Melvin made headlines recently writing an open letter to President Trump, calling his criticism of NFL players kneeling during the national anthem divisive.Well, that's almost it for a packed program.As you may know, we're the official Sunday show of the Washington Nationals. Last night the Nationals beat the Chicago Cubs 6-3 to even the National League Division series at one game apiece. And someone was so excited, he showed up this morning.

I'm Christiane Amanpour, and at the top of the news this week, the president and the new Congress. OBAMA: We can't afford two years of just squabbling. AMANPOUR: Is it time for compromise? BOEHNER: The American people will want us to focus on their message during the election. AMANPOUR: Or is it time for gridlock? MCCONNELL: If the administration wants cooperation, it will have to begin to move in our direction. AMANPOUR: This morning... (UNKNOWN): We've come to take our government back! AMANPOUR: ... Mr. Smith goes to Washington, an exclusive interview with Rand Paul, Tea Party senator-elect. Then, wedded to tax cuts. (UNKNOWN): Cut taxes. (UNKNOWN): Cut taxes. (UNKNOWN): Cut taxes. (UNKNOWN): Cut taxes. (UNKNOWN): Cut taxes. AMANPOUR: Their hero may be Ronald Reagan, but his tax man says that'll finish the economy off, while this Republican says tax cuts will revive it. David Stockman versus Michael Pence, an exclusive ""This Week"" debate. Plus, our roundtable, Democratic Senator Evan Bayh and former Obama adviser John Podesta join ABC's George Will, political director Amy Walter, and former Bush strategist Matthew Dowd. And remembering another historic election 50 (ph) years ago this week. Plus, the Sunday funnies. LETTERMAN: That's where our kids will live, the future, Republicans and Democrats working together. We're screwed. ANNOUNCER: From all across our world to the heart of our nation's capital, ABC's ""This Week"" with Christiane Amanpour starts now. AMANPOUR: Hello again, everyone. After Tuesday's election, Republicans have the largest House majority since the late 1940s during the Truman administration. What they do with that majority and whether Democrats and Republicans will work together is our focus this morning. ABC's John Donvan starts us off. DONVAN (voice-over): Listen and see if you can pick out -- and it's going to be easy, actually -- the hottest, hippest word of the week. (UNKNOWN): Well, it was a historic election. (UNKNOWN): A historic... (UNKNOWN): ... historic... (UNKNOWN): ... historic... (UNKNOWN): ... historic night. (UNKNOWN): ... historic... (UNKNOWN): ... historic election. DONVAN: You got it. What we saw in this election, a president who took a shellacking... OBAMA: I'm sure there are easier ways to learn these lessons. DONVAN: ... a GOP that gets to gloat again, just careful not too much... BOEHNER: This is not a time for celebration. It's a time to roll up our sleeves and go to work. DONVAN: That outcome made this election -- oh, here we go again... (UNKNOWN): ... historic opportunity here... DONVAN: Yes, historic. DONVAN: Or maybe not. Simply put, history is the writing down of what happens, and a lot of things happened, happened even last week. Giants over Rangers to take the Series in five, it happened, but was it historic? Maybe if you live in the Bay Area. For the rest of us, though, historic is defined by what gets remembered long afterward, for changing what followed, like Susana Martinez, the Republican who won the governor's race in New Mexico Tuesday. BLITZER: She's a Latina, and so this is historic in New Mexico. DONVAN: Yes, Wolf, that was arguably historic. No one could achieve that first ever again. But the mere fact of the GOP capture of the House -- here is the chart, the 60-plus seats they took from the Democrats -- it's a lot, but it's not a record-breaker. The thing is, we really need to know what the Republicans ultimately do with their win to see what will really change. 1994, when they swept both houses, then something changed. They came in with clear ideas. They were listed in their Contract with America. They said they were going to work with the Democratic president. (UNKNOWN): We can only have president at a time. It's President Clinton. And we know that we need to work with him where we can. DONVAN: And what they got was, after a fair amount of struggle, a Democratic president to declare... CLINTON: The era of big government is over. DONVAN: ... welfare reform. We have never been the same, and both sides had a hand in it. This time, the main GOP idea is not Obama, not his policies... MCCONNELL: Our primary legislative goals are to repeal and replace and health spending bill. DONVAN: ... and not really much pretense at a governing partnership. MCCONNELL: The only way to do all of those things is to put someone in the White House who won't veto any of these things. DONVAN: So is that the mindset that is going to make things happen in Washington that will prove that this election in the end was as historic as everyone said it was on night one? For ""This Week,"" John Donvan, ABC News. AMANPOUR: One of those aiming to make history is Rand Paul, senator-elect from Kentucky, and he joins me this morning. Welcome. Thank you for being here. AMANPOUR: In a way, it is, to coin a phrase, historic. There's never been a Tea Party in modern American history, and you are one of the prominent Tea Partiers. What is your first aim once you get to -- to the Senate? PAUL: I think the debt. We have to do something about the debt. I think we've been fiscally irresponsible for a generation or more here. And the one thing about the Tea Party that's interesting is, it really is equal parts chastisement to both parties. You know, Republicans doubled the debt when we were in charge, and then Democrats are tripling the debt. And I've said this over and over again. It's not about political party, but it is about fiscally trying to do something to balance our budget. AMANPOUR: Well, we've all seen and we followed the campaign, and there was a lot of talk, a lot of slogans and platitudes about cutting the debt, balancing the budget, cutting the deficit. But there has not been any direct information on how you're going to do that, no specifics. It was fairly content-free, the platform. So where are you going to cut in order to make a meaningful change? PAUL: Well, some of it has to be procedural, in the sense that we need to balance our budget by law. If you force legislators to balance, at the end of the day, if it has to be balanced, then they step up and they become legislators and can find out where to cut. AMANPOUR: So you're going to move for a balanced budget amendment? PAUL: Absolutely. Absolutely. And short of that, we need a rule -- it takes a while to get an amendment to the Constitution -- let's have a rule that -- let's obey our rule. They passed pay-as-you-go, and they break it in the first three weeks they have it. So we need rules. PAUL: And we need to obey the rules. The second thing you need is -- and I don't see things in terms of political party, so I think this can be something where I can work across the aisle -- but the second thing you need is a compromise on where the spending cuts come from. Republicans traditionally say, oh, we'll cut domestic spending, but we won't touch the military. The liberals -- the ones who are good -- will say, oh, we'll cut the military, but we won't cut domestic spending. AMANPOUR: All right. Well, let's ask you. PAUL: Bottom line is, you have to look at everything across the board. AMANPOUR: All right. Where, then? Military? Would you cut the military? AMANPOUR: By how much? Obviously, Robert Gates has made some suggestions. PAUL: Well, I think it's hard -- it's hard to give exact numbers, but I think one thing that's concerning -- you know, recently, Admiral Milliken (ph) said that the interest on the debt now is going to approach in the next couple of years -- just the interest on the debt -- will approach what we spend in the national defense budget. So, I mean, that should alarm us all. Bernanke says the debt is unsustainable. We need to do something about it. AMANPOUR: The question, again, is, exactly what? Because, again, the Republicans in the campaign have come up with $50 billion here, $100 billion there, a lot to you and me, but in terms of reducing a $1.3 trillion deficit, how does the math add up? PAUL: It has to be... AMANPOUR: Are you going to cut entitlements? PAUL: It has to be everything across the board. AMANPOUR: Entitlements? PAUL: And you -- you have to look at entitlements. AMANPOUR: Social Security? PAUL: What I would say is not the people who are currently on it and not those approaching retirement, but the sooner we fix it, the better. So it may be 55 and under, but that should be this year. We should look at 55 and under, what do we do to change the system to make it more sustainable? AMANPOUR: Raise the retirement age? PAUL: You may have to. You may have to. They're already talking about it. I mean, there's a bipartisan commission up here talking about raising age, graduating the benefits, maybe having means testing. You have to look at all of these things. They need to be on the table. But what you have to get to get there is you have to take it out of campaign mode. PAUL: You know, everybody in the campaign mode, how long have we been running Mediscare ads? Democrats have run against Republicans for years saying we're going to take away your grandmother's Social Security. We're not going to do that. PAUL: But we need to fix it, because we have too many people retiring. AMANPOUR: What about health care? All candidates were saying we had to repeal health care, yet the American people did not say that in this election: 47 percent said repeal; 48 percent said no. PAUL: Well, it depends on -- depends on where you look. You look in Missouri, 70 percent voted to get rid of Obamacare. AMANPOUR: But just across -- across the board, is that what you're going to do? PAUL: In Kentucky, 70 percent of the people would like to repeal it or have our attorney general challenge the constitutionality of it. I think there are some real constitutional questions. It's going forward. A federal judge in both Florida and Virginia have said, yes, we're going to go forward with this. So I think you will see that go forward and we will challenge it in the courts. And also we should try to repeal it. AMANPOUR: Let me ask you this in terms, again, of balancing the budget. There are many economists who simply say the math does not add up if you're not going to agree to raising taxes. Do you agree that taxes will have to be raised, as well? PAUL: Well, I think it's not a revenue problem; it's a spending problem. AMANPOUR: But it is a revenue problem, according to so many economists. PAUL: Well, yes and no. I mean, we bring in -- the thing is, is that a lot of times people would come to me and say, well, you don't believe in any government. And I would tell them, you know what? I believe in $2.4 trillion worth; I just don't think you can have $4 trillion worth if you only bring in $2.4 trillion. 2.4's a lot. That's a huge government. We've doubled the size of government in 10 years. PAUL: We don't need bigger government. We need to shrink the size of government. AMANPOUR: Right, but without making strong entitlement and other cuts -- and even if one does, most of the economists say the math simply doesn't add up to keep -- to keep tax cuts on and on and on. Will you agree to some? PAUL: My -- my hope now -- my hope is to be on the Budget Committee and to go through all of these numbers and, by January, to have a balanced budget that I will introduce. I want there to be a Republican alternative -- whether it wins or not, I want the Republican message to be one of balanced budgets. If they won't do it in a year, we'll say, how about two years? If they won't do it in two years, how about three years? But someone has to believe it. AMANPOUR: Give me one specific cut, Senator-elect. PAUL: All across the board. AMANPOUR: One significant one. No, but you can't just keep saying all across the board. PAUL: Well, no, I can, because I'm going to look at every program, every program. But I would freeze federal hiring. I would maybe reduce federal employees by 10 percent. I'd probably reduce their wages by 10 percent. The average federal employee makes $120,000 a year. The average private employee makes $60,000 a year. Let's get them more in line, and let's find savings. Let's hire no new federal workers. AMANPOUR: Pay for soldiers? Would you cut that? PAUL: I think that's something that you can't do. I don't think... AMANPOUR: You cannot do? PAUL: Right. I think that soldiers have to be paid. Now, can we say that gradually we don't need as large of an Army if we're not in two wars? Yes, I think you can say that. You can save money there. You can bring some troops home or have Europe pay more for their defense and Japan pay more and Korea pay more for their defense or bring those troops home and have savings there. AMANPOUR: Have you thought much about foreign policy? Does the Tea Party have a foreign policy? PAUL: I think the Tea Party believes in a strong national defense, that it's a priority for our country, that the Constitution exemplifies and says that national defense is one of our priorities. But, no, primarily the Tea Party is about the debt. It's concerned and worried that we're inheriting or passing along this debt to our kids and our grandkids, is the number one thing of the Tea Party. AMANPOUR: So, again, to talk about the debt and to talk about taxes, there seems to be, again, just so much sort of generalities, for want of a better word. AMANPOUR: And, for instance, there are many people... PAUL: Well, the thing is that you can call it a generality, but what if -- what if I were president and I said to you, ""Tomorrow, we're going to have a 5 percent cut across the board in everything""? That's not a generality, but there are thousands of programs. If you say, ""Well, what are all the specifics?"" There are books written on all the specifics. There's a book by Christopher Edwards, downsizing government, goes through every program. That's what it will take. It's a very detailed analysis. But you need to ask of every program, when we take no program off the table, can it be downsized? Can it be privatized? Can it be made smaller? AMANPOUR: And what about earmarks? Would you say no to earmarks? PAUL: No -- no more earmarks. AMANPOUR: No more? Not even in your state? PAUL: No. No. But I do tell people within Kentucky is I say, look, I will argue within the committee process for things that are good for Kentucky that they want and also within the context of a balanced budget. Here's what happens. You go to the Transportation Committee and they say, ""What do you want?"" But it should be, ""How much do we have?"" No one asks, ""How much do we have?"" So we just spend it. And then, at the end of the day, if we don't have it, we either print it or borrow it. Those are bad things. There is no restraint, but that's why you need rules. In Kentucky, we have a balanced budget amendment. We have to balance our budget. So they have to be better legislators. AMANPOUR: One of the emergencies is going to be voting to lift the debt ceiling. AMANPOUR: Would you do that? PAUL: I don't believe I will vote to raise the debt ceiling. PAUL: No. I think that we need to send a message -- we need to send a strong message that... AMANPOUR: The government would default, then. PAUL: Well, only if we won the vote, would they default. AMANPOUR: So you think it won't pass? PAUL: You know, I think it's unlikely. There are people who vote against the debt ceiling every time to send a message that adding more debt is wrong. I think we shouldn't add more debt. I think we should immediately start cutting spending. We should have a freezing hire. We should not spend any more of the stimulus money that's unspent, the TARP money that's unspent. You know, we need to get our fiscal house in order. But bigger than the specifics is a rule. Congress does not obey their own rules. This is what -- you want to know where the Tea Party is, why we're unhappy? We're unhappy because they pass pay-as-you-go and, in the first three weeks, they say everything's an emergency and they evade their own rules. That's a problem. AMANPOUR: Right. Well, let me -- let me ask you about some of the challenges you might face from within your own party. Do you expect to be welcomed with open arms by the establishment Republicans? Trent Lott, former senior leader of the Republican Party, said when you get to Congress, they've got to co-opt you. PAUL: Well, I think the interesting thing is... AMANPOUR: Are you co-optable? PAUL: No, but I think the Tea Party actually is co-opting Washington. You look around you... AMANPOUR: So vice versa? PAUL: Absolutely. We're coming. We're -- we're proud. We're strong. We're loud. And we're going to co-opt. And, in fact, I think we're already shaping the debate. You hear a lot of talk about the debt now. Where do you think that's coming from? AMANPOUR: Can you compromise with the Democrats? PAUL: That's coming from our movement. Absolutely. And I told you where the compromise is. The compromise is, Republicans never say they'll cut anything out of military. What I say is, national defense is the most important thing we do in Washington, but there's still waste in the military budget. You have to make it smaller, but you also then need to address, how many wars are we going to be involved in? Are we going to be involved in every war all the time? AMANPOUR: Afghanistan? Are you going to call for early withdrawal there? PAUL: We have to -- we need to have a debate over it. PAUL: We need to have a debate over it. AMANPOUR: But the president has a timetable. Do you disagree with that? PAUL: Right. What I think is that ultimately troop deployments are decided by the president, not by Congress. I don't think really Congress can decide troop levels. In fact, I think if Congress told him to bring all of them home on a certain time, I think he can do what he wants constitutionally. But what I would say is, we need to have a debate in our country, in our Congress over, is our national security still threatened by Afghanistan? Do we need to be there? Do we need to be there in a large... AMANPOUR: Do you think so? PAUL: Well, do we need to be there? I want to ask these questions. Some of them I don't know all the information yet. But what I would say is, do we need to be there in a large ground -- ground war? Or could we be there on a smaller base and have the Afghans -- after 10 years... AMANPOUR: Well, that's the debate that's going on right now, in any event. PAUL: Well, after 10 years, I think the Afghans need to have stepped up more to do more. And if you ask our G.I.s, when I asked them from Kentucky leaving the base, I say, ""Are the Afghans stepping up enough? Would you rather the Afghans do more of the patrolling on the streets?"" Every one of these young brave men and women will tell you, ""Yes."" So the mood is changing, even within those who are the brave young men and women that are serving our country. AMANPOUR: Will you ratify the START treaty? PAUL: I think we need to have more discussion on it, but it doesn't sound like that I'm probably going to be in favor of that. AMANPOUR: It doesn't sound? PAUL: We're going -- we're going to have a discussion about it. AMANPOUR: Wouldn't it be a good thing to have more nuclear treaties with the Russians? PAUL: Well, I mean, some of it has been good. I mean, some of it under George W. Bush... AMANPOUR: That would save money, too, wouldn't it? PAUL: ... under George W. Bush, we did reduce armaments. And I think you have to -- some of it is the devil's in the details there, and I need to know more about it before making an immediate decision. AMANPOUR: Well, we hope to have you back, and we'll get more details from you next time. AMANPOUR: Senator-elect Rand Paul, thank you very much for joining us. AMANPOUR: And the Bush-era tax cuts expire at the end of this year. If Congress doesn't extend them, taxes will go up for everyone. One man says that would be a good thing. David Stockman was the budget director for President Ronald Reagan. He criticizes his party for sticking with the tax cut mantra, and he joins us this morning. Also, Congressman Mike Pence, a senior House Republican leader who takes the opposite view. Welcome to both of you. Thank you for being here this morning. AMANPOUR: Let me first ask you, Representative Pence, you have stepped down, you're planning to step down from your leadership position. Are you running for president? PENCE: Well, let me say, two years ago, I was asked to serve in a leadership position in the Congress, which after spending most of my career fighting runaway spending under Republican control was something as a surprise to many. But I took it because I thought we had an opportunity to lead our -- our party back to a majority. And I took the job. I believed if we returned our party to the practice of conservative principles on Capitol Hill, we could win back the Congress. This week's historic victory for conservative values for the American people is an -- in my judgment, a fulfillment of my commitment. And so now my family and I are going to take our time to prayerfully consider ways that we can serve our state and serve our nation in the years ahead. AMANPOUR: Very quickly: Would you run for president? PENCE: Well, look, we've been very humbled by the encouragement we've received back in Indiana and around the country. And we're intent on taking the coming weeks to really prayerfully consider that, to wait on the Lord, to seek counsel. And after the first of the year, we'll make a decision. AMANPOUR: Or governorship? PENCE: Well, we -- as I said, we've gotten... AMANPOUR: So when can we hear your decision, after you've done all that consultation? PENCE: Well, we frankly -- we've frankly been very humbled by the encouragement we've received back in our beloved Indiana and around the country, but we're going to take the holidays here. And as I said, we're going to reflect on it. AMANPOUR: All right. Well, when you're going to... PENCE: And our question will be, where can we make the most difference for what matters most to us? And what called me to public service back when the -- back in the Reagan administration, when I first ran for Congress, was... AMANPOUR: We're going to ask you about that because... PENCE: ... a commitment to conservative values. AMANPOUR: ... because apparently Ronald Reagan was your political idol, so we'll ask you a little bit about that. AMANPOUR: Still is, OK. Well, we're going to ask about his economic philosophy with the man who engineered it. Well, so, David Stockman, former budget director, you have basically said that Tuesday gave voice and gave further voice to what you call the big lie. STOCKMAN: Exactly. This is not 1981. This is not morning again in America. We've drifted now for 30 years. Both parties, unfortunately, became free lunch parties, the Republicans cutting taxes every time they had a chance, never doing anything about spending, and the Democrats digging in to defend everything that was there. As a result, we now have this massive deficit. Today, the gross public debt is $14 trillion. The first thing we did when we walked into the White House in 1981 was struggle with raising the public debt to $1 trillion. So in that 30 years, the public debt has gone up 14 times. Our economy is only four times larger. We're losing the race. And we're now becoming the banana republic finance, printing -- the Fed, these mad men who are out of control at the Fed, are printing new money, equal to 100 percent of the debt that we're issuing each month. This will not end well. It's -- it's going to end in a disaster. AMANPOUR: Right. And you're saying a tax increase and entitlement cuts are the only possible policy tools right now? STOCKMAN: It's built into the math. I think, you know... AMANPOUR: But this gentleman here is saying, no, correct? I mean, you don't want to cut any -- raise any taxes. You want to extend the tax cuts. PENCE: Look, I don't think higher taxes are going to get anybody hired. I don't -- I think raising taxes in the worst economy in 25 years is a profoundly bad idea. But can I say what I agree with David on? PENCE: You know, I opposed the Medicare prescription drug entitlement. I opposed the Wall Street bailout. I opposed the stimulus bill. I -- I think this week's election was a historic rejection of American liberalism and the Obama and Pelosi agenda. The American people are tired of the borrowing, the spending, the bailouts, the takeovers. So to that point -- I disagree with David strongly on any tax increase. But to his point... AMANPOUR: But the math isn't there. PENCE: ... both parties have failed the American people and have allowed this city to -- to -- to be -- to expand spending beyond any reasonable expectation... AMANPOUR: But, sir, with all due respect... AMANPOUR: ... what you just said was the campaign -- campaign slogan. Now it's time to legislate. You have a new Congress. You have a new reality. You have a huge budget deficit, a massive national debt. And what I'm trying to figure out is, where, beyond what you've been saying in the campaign about, you know, less government, less spending, where you're going to make big cuts? And do you agree that there will, after a period of time, perhaps, need to be tax increases? PENCE: Well, look, Republicans have put on the table -- and continue to put on the table -- our commitment to change the fiscal direction of Washington, D.C., to put our national government on a pathway toward a balanced budget. The president yesterday called for a spending freeze. Well, we -- we think we ought to go back to pre-stimulus, pre-bailout levels and freeze there -- there's been an 84 percent increase in domestic spending since this administration took office. We've got to roll back there. That will save $100 billion in the first year. How about a net hiring freeze on Capitol Hill? And let me anticipate -- David makes the point -- absolutely, for Americans under the age of 40, we've got to put everything on the table in the area of Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security. We have got to reform these entitlement programs. They are threatening the fiscal vitality of future generations of Americans. AMANPOUR: Is that enough? STOCKMAN: Well, no, not nearly enough. The point is, we're now in real-world governance. And you don't get 100 times at bat. The Republicans have been at bat for 30 years, and they've whiffed on everything. Social Security needs to be means-tested right now, not for benefits in 2030, right now, for the top one-third of beneficiaries who have private income that they've earned over their lifetime. We need to drastically scale back Medicare. And the Republicans expanded it. And I appreciate what Mike is saying, but there's no track record of a willingness to take on the doctors, the pharmaceutical companies, the scooter chair manufacturers, who are everywhere. So we need to take on defense, OK? We are now at the point where this -- we're kind of at the, you know, sundown as an imperialist power. And we can't have credit card imperialism. We can't be the policemen of the world anymore because we can't afford it. We're going to have to cut defense drastically. And that isn't just fraud, waste and abuse. It's force structure, fewer divisions. STOCKMAN: And even if we do all that, we still have to raise revenue. AMANPOUR: OK. Would -- you know, you heard Rand Paul say it wasn't a revenue problem, but you -- and you've also heard some economists saying that perhaps right now extending and -- and -- and increasing taxes in this crisis right now, immediately, might not be the most wise thing. What are you saying? STOCKMAN: The crisis will be with us for the next 5 to 10 years. We've had a debt spree for 30 years. The economy has been badly injured. It is sunk under the weight of $50 trillion of debt that we've created publicly and privately. The recovery is over. It was weak; it was tepid. What we have now is day-to-day, 1 percent to 2 percent growth, if we're lucky. And so therefore government has to focus on paying its bills and not micromanaging or simulating the economy. PENCE: But the way we're going to put our fiscal house in order is you have to cut spending now. Everything has to be on the table. I've been battling against runaway spending under both political parties throughout my 10 years in Congress. That's a given. But you can't balance the budget on 9.6 percent unemployment. You can't balance the budget on a struggling economy. The last thing we should do is allow a tax increase on job creators in this country to take effect in January or, as David suggests, a tax increase on every American. And let me take one point... AMANPOUR: What will happen when Congress comes back in lame-duck? What will happen with this tax battle... PENCE: Before we get -- look, David Stockman is, you know, he's a really famous guy and a thoughtful guy. I just disagree with him vehemently and I, frankly, have for about 30 years. David believes that every tax increase equals a revenue increase, but that's not true. Anybody who is familiar with the historical data from the IRS knows that raising income tax rates will likely actually reduce federal revenues. AMANPOUR: Let me ask David... PENCE: So if we raise taxes, the American people are very likely going to -- the top 1 percent are going to send less money to Washington, D.C., and that will never get us out of this... STOCKMAN: I just have to respectfully disagree. You will have some loss of revenue because some activity or transactions won't happen, but if you raise taxes on paper by $100 billion, maybe you'll get $90 billion or $85 billion. But it's just common sense fact that, when you raise the rates, you get more revenue. Normally, it's a bad thing to do. But we are in such dire shape that we have no choice but to accept the negative trade-off of some harm to the economy to start paying our bills. Otherwise, we're dependent on the Chinese, we're dependent on OPEC, we're dependent on a bunch of hedge fund guys to buy our debt, and this game is about over. AMANPOUR: And, Congressman Pence, you talked a lot about the... PENCE: Raising income tax rates on the top 1 percent will not increase revenues to the federal treasury. AMANPOUR: Well, not -- not according to -- to the budget director, who is the architect of the biggest, most sweeping tax cuts in American history. But the question I have for you is, what about all that -- you know, you all talk about the middle class. But the middle class, we've seen their incomes stagnant, whereas the huge amount of wealth has been accumulated by a very, very small top percent. It's not fair, is it? Is it? PENCE: Well, look -- look, what's not fair is the idea that, at a time when tens of millions of Americans are unemployed or underemployed, that you would actually allow a tax increase on job-creators, a tax increase on their employees. I don't know anybody back in Indiana, in the city or on the farm, who thinks that raising taxes on their small business owner boss is going to put them back to work or get them back to full-time. AMANPOUR: We've got one -- time for... STOCKMAN: Two years after the crisis on Wall Street, it has been announced that bonuses this year will be $144 billion, the highest in history. That's who's going to get this tax cut on the top, you know, 2 percent of the population. They don't need a tax cut. They don't deserve it. And, therefore, what we have to do is focus on Main Street, and that means getting our house in order fiscally, not tax cuts that we can't afford. AMANPOUR: On that note, there's plenty to talk about, and we're going to see it develop in Congress pretty shortly all of this. David Stockman, Mike Pence, thank you so much, indeed, for joining us. AMANPOUR: And the roundtable will be up next and looking back 50 years to another historic election. Stay with us. AMANPOUR: We're back with our roundtable. Joining us this morning, George Will, Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana -- who's retiring at the end of this Congress -- George Podesta, president of the Center for American Progress, former White House chief of staff for President Clinton and also led the transition for President Obama -- hard to believe that that was two years ago -- Matthew Dowd, former strategist for President Bush, and Amy Walter, ABC's political director. Thank you all for being here. Let me ask you all the first question, which is, is there a possibility of compromise going ahead or gridlock? George? WILL: I think there will be gridlock, because the object is to control the presidency in our presidential system, and the presidential campaign has now begun. The first question confronting them when they come back up there in a few weeks will be extending the Bush tax cuts. The Democrats will try and decouple the question of those for under $250,000 and those over; Republicans will refuse to do that. It will either be settled now in the lame-duck session or afterwards and will be retroactive in any case. AMANPOUR: And, John Podesta, who I wrongly called George Podesta -- I don't know what was going through my mind, I was looking at George Will... BAYH: He's been called worse. AMANPOUR: Gridlock or any chance of any solutions in this new Congress? PODESTA: Well, I think you heard President Obama in the days after the election saying that he wanted to try and reach out and find a way to find some areas to compromise. And I think the Republicans now have a responsibility to come forward and be partners in governing, particularly in the House, where they're going to have to put some -- some of their own ideas on the table and not just be the party of ""no."" But, you know, I think we're still in a kind of poisonous political atmosphere, so I don't hold out tremendous hope to see things going forward. I think one of the early tests will be whether the Senate will take up the new START treaty, which has bipartisan support in a lame-duck session. AMANPOUR: Well, you heard -- you heard Rand Paul say he wouldn't vote for it, because, of course, that would be coming in January. Go ahead. DOWD: I think there is a possibility of -- of reaching compromise, whether there's a probability of it. But the interesting thing from a political standpoint, just look at the political dynamics. It is in President Obama's best interest and the people that were just elected, the Republicans' best interests, to compromise and get something done, because the country basically keeps saying over and over and over at each election, ""Do something. Cooperate. Get it done."" And they keep sending wake-up call after wake-up call. And if the Republicans -- new Republicans in Congress paid heed and Barack Obama paid heed, they would get something done. BAYH: I agree with that, Christiane. The question here is whether enlightened self-interest can triumph over the ideological polarization we now have in the country. AMANPOUR: Which you've just written about. BAYH: Well, yes. And it's going to be very difficult for moderate Republicans when they see Bob Bennett taken out in Utah, what happened to Lisa Murkowski in Alaska or to Mike Castle in Delaware, to compromise with the president. They'll face an uproar in their own party. And in my party, many of the moderates were obliterated. So I think we can actually make progress on some things. Tax reform may be one of them, education reform another. But on the -- the big things, I think George is right. There will probably continue to be gridlock, fight it out running up to the next election. DOWD: But ultimately -- ultimately the president of the United States -- I know the Democrats like to say it's the Republicans' fault that we haven't done this and all -- and the Democrats said the same thing about President Bush in his presidency, the reason why there wasn't more compromise, because his -- his fault. Ultimately, I think it's -- it's contingent upon President Obama reaching across the aisle in a real, credible way and trying to bring Republicans along. He has the biggest megaphone. It's up to him to do it. AMANPOUR: I've got to bring Amy Walter -- and I want to -- but I want her to react to this. We're going to put up what President Obama will be saying on ""60 Minutes"" this -- this evening and also what John Boehner will be saying, the next speaker of the House. OBAMA: We were so busy and so focused on getting a bunch of stuff done that we stopped paying attention to the fact that leadership isn't just legislation, that it's a matter of persuading people. BOEHNER: There seems to be some denial on the part of the president and other Democrat leaders -- you would think that the other party would understand that the American people have clearly repudiated the policies that they've put forward the last two years. AMANPOUR: Amy Walter, political director at ABC, what did the voters say as they came out? Did they repudiate one party, both parties? What did they say? WALTER: Well, I want to follow up on both what Matthew and Senator Bayh were saying, which was, you know, the problem with -- with midterm election, wave elections, is that what it tends to do is wipe out the people in the middle. 2006 wiped out almost all -- and 2008 -- almost all moderate Republicans left in the House and the Senate. And the same thing happened in this election, with -- with moderate and conservative Democrats. So now what we're left with is two very polarized parts of this Congress who see no reason to compromise, because fundamentally they got elected by their base. So I think that's a very big problem. The second piece in terms of what's going to happen, who needs to compromise, how does this work, fundamentally, I mean, we can bring Dr. Phil into this debate, we can bring Oprah in about the psychology of all this, but fundamentally it's about the economy. This was a fundamental repudiation, if it was of anything, it was that we have a struggling economy, we have 9.6 percent unemployment. And what voters saw for the last year-and-a-half was a lot of infighting in Washington. They saw debate about issues that, quite frankly, didn't impact them personally. They didn't see the benefits to that. Yes, they saw a lot of money going out the door, that -- you know, Congress writing a lot of checks that didn't come directly back to them. That's a lot of what this election was about. But what they're saying, fundamentally, especially what independents are saying is, if you guys, meaning the Republicans, the new people who are in charge now in the House, and Democrats, control the White House and the Senate, can't figure this out, we're going to throw you all out again. AMANPOUR: Well, there you go. That's -- that's my point again. What did they say? And it's not just giving a mandate to one and just repudiating another. People who I spoke to on the road during the campaign wanted more than anything for both sides to come together and figure out a solution to their problems. WILL: But the narrative of the Democrats, from the president and to the former and perhaps soon to be again Speaker Pelosi, have adopted is, there's nothing wrong with our policies. The election had nothing to do with the substance of government. It was all a terrible misunderstanding because we made some communication mistakes. I gather tonight on ""60 Minutes,"" the president will say he has to master the art of couching his arguments in ways the people can understand, so it's fundamentally a problem with the American people. AMANPOUR: Is it -- is it that? Is it -- is it a messaging problem? Or is it a real political problem of not having brought along the American people? PODESTA: I think the president's real political problem is stuck in what Amy said, the 9.6 percent unemployment rate. He inherited a mess. I think everybody gives -- understands that. But I think everybody is tired of hearing about that. The question is, what's going to happen tomorrow? And he has to have a credible plan to move the country forward, to get jobs growing again, to get wages growing again, and to get the deficit under control. And I think he's going to reach out to try to find some partnership with the Republicans. Whether they're willing to try to work with him on that is still anybody's guess. BAYH: The real problem, Christiane -- the political process is not delivering the results the American people want. We've got systemic dysfunction because of the ideological polarization. Most people want practical problem-solving in the middle. That's not what we're getting right now. So the independents went 8 percent for the Democrats two years ago; this time, they went 15 percent for the Republicans. I think John's right. They're likely to go back and forth until they see the kind of progress they want. AMANPOUR: The tax battle is going to be a big one. It's going to come up pretty soon. Let me just play you what Warren Buffett has said about this, as we heard from Rand Paul, we heard David Stockman and Mike Pence talk about it. Let -- let me just say what Warren Buffett thinks. BUFFETT: We're going to have to get more money from somebody. Now, the question is, do we get more money from the person that's going to serve me lunch today or do we get it from me? AMANPOUR: Well, there you go. That's the question. And this to you, is progressive politics dead? Are your liberal ideas dead? PODESTA: Well, I think that, two years ago, people thought there was an ascendancy. And two years from now, we'll see whether the president can -- can restore his standing with the American people and move the country forward. So I don't think it's dead. I think you had -- you had an electorate that was skewed very much differently than it was in 2008, but he's going to have -- as I said -- to come forward and -- and not only try to find compromise, but I think he's going to have to fight for principle, too. And I think that's where this tax fight is really going to -- that's where the rubber's going to hit the road. He said -- President Obama's answered that question. He said we're going to take that money from millionaires. The question is whether he can offer the Republicans something in exchange. I think one of the ideas that -- that he could substitute for tax cuts for the very wealthiest Americans is perhaps a payroll holiday, which the Republicans have endorsed, which would actually create more jobs. So there's going to have to be some give-and-take, but I think there's also got to be principle underlying that. DOWD: To me, the fundamental problem -- the fundamental problem in this, right now, I think -- and both parties have huge credibility problems on this issue from different perspectives on it -- the problem is of asking people to pay more in taxes to a government they don't trust is never going to work. Until they trust that the federal government can get the job done efficiently and effectively, they are not going to want to put more money in the system. But if you're a Republican, in order to maintain some level of credibility, if you want to extend the Bush tax cuts, in my view, then you have to say, we're going to extend this, but we also have to cut this in order to even the score, because if you want to fight the deficit, you can't do both. BAYH: This is an important point Matt just made. The Democrats, we have to address the deficit. If you look what was driving independents, the people who voted in Massachusetts for Scott Brown, and even to this election, it was the deficit and the debt. The economy, but the fiscal problems. Our solution to the fiscal problems can't only be tax increases. We have to stand for spending restraint, as well. And Matt's point, back in -- in the Clinton time, remember reinventing government? They understood we have to convince the taxpayers, show the taxpayers that they're getting value for their dollar. That's very important. The final thing I'd say, look at the U.K. A coalition government comes in. You've got conservatives coming in. They don't like tax increases there, either, so their solution was 75 percent spending restraint. But once they got that, they then put 25 percent revenue on the table. So a compromise can be worked out. AMANPOUR: Well, yeah, and they're -- they're saying there, for every $3 in tax -- in -- in spending cuts, $1 up in taxes. BAYH: And that's a conservative government. AMANPOUR: Precisely. At all a goer (ph)? WILL: No. What the Republicans will say is, if you extend all the Bush tax cuts, you will still be raising as a percentage of GDP about 18 percent in federal revenues, which is slightly above the postwar norm. The Republicans do not think we have a tax -- problem of too low taxes, but too much spending. AMANPOUR: Let me just go to Amy Walter. Amy, there was a lot -- and we saw a lot of the Tea Party candidates and many of the candidates presenting for election this time were women. But the net result is not more women, is it? Tell us what's happened with the women vote and the women representation. WALTER: Yeah, no, it was very interesting. I mean, the net result, in terms of Congress, there -- for the first time in 30 years, there are fewer women in Congress. But I do think it's -- an important point is, who is visible, the women symbolically who are out front right now, and who are we talking about now, less than a week away from Election Day? We're talking about Nancy Pelosi. We're talking about Sarah Palin. We're talking about the first woman Hispanic elected to the governorship in New Mexico. We're talking about the first Indian-American woman elected in South Carolina as governor, Nikki Haley. So while the numbers themselves weren't particularly good for women, the fact that more women are sitting at the table -- in fact, the other person I forgot to mention is Michele Bachmann, self-appointed Tea Party activist and leader in the House, who is challenging the Republican establishment there for a seat in the caucus. So I think while, you know, we may not see the numbers that have increased, what we do see is more women who are making very important and very -- are very much upfront in this process. DOWD: And I think that's an important point. Though there's less women going to be serving in Congress up the street here, the interesting thing is there's going to be more women serving in governor's offices. The first woman governor of South Carolina, the first woman governor of New Mexico, the first woman governor of Oklahoma. And in those places, where people actually trust the state to do something, as senator, former Governor of Indiana Bayh knows, that people actually go -- they're looking to the state governments much more than Washington, D.C., to solve the problems in their life because they trust it. AMANPOUR: Let me ask about a very prominent woman, Nancy Pelosi. Is it in the best interest of your party that she is taking this leadership fight now? PODESTA: Well, I think that the Republicans spent millions of dollars demonizing her. (UNKNOWN): ... on her own. PODESTA: They're all now popping champagne corks. But I think I'd -- if I were them, I'd calm down a little bit, because she did take the House back from them. She's got the majority in the House. She's -- she's tough, disciplined, a great fighter. That's how she produced the legislative achievements that President Obama asked her to produce. And what she needs, I think, is balanced leadership, and that's still -- that's a challenge that she's going to have to face now. AMANPOUR: Very quickly. We've got 45 seconds before the green room roundtable. BAYH: It'll be a big topic in this town, but (inaudible) American people really won't care. The right will continue to demonize her. But since she's not in a position to actually implement things, that won't matter so much, and she's very good inside at raising money and those sorts of things, so I think it's really a non-issue. WILL: Her caucus will be smaller, but much more liberal, so it will support her. And she will also have the support of the Republicans, who would like her to stay. BAYH: Finally, bipartisanship. AMANPOUR: There you go. We achieved it. And President George W. Bush's book is coming out this week. There are interviews; there's all sorts of reviews. And no doubt, perhaps, you'll talk about it in the roundtable in the green room at abcnews.com/thisweek, where you can also find our fact checks by PolitiFact."

TAPPER: Angering veterans and his fellow Republicans. Is this the tipping point some in the Republican establishment have been hoping for? We will ask Senator Marco Rubio in an exclusive interview. Plus, defending the deal. BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You're going to hear a lot of overheated and often dishonest arguments. TAPPER: The president comes out swinging as he fights for his historic agreement to slow Iran's nuclear ambitions. But is Congress set on killing it? And another Republican joins the race to the White House. Governor Scott Walker hits the trail in a Winnebago. But is he ready for a bumpy ride? GOV. SCOTT WALKER (R-WI), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: ... me a question, I will answer...DANA BASH, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: But you're not really answering this. TAPPER: The best political team in television will be here to break it all down. (END VIDEOTAPE)TAPPER: Good morning, everyone. I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, D.C., where the State Of Our Union is all atwitter, Republicans and veterans buzzing over Donald Trump's latest comments, this time questioning the heroism of Senator John McCain's five-and-a-half years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: John McCain goes, oh, boy, Trump makes my life difficult. He had 15,000 crazies show up, crazies. He called them all crazy. I said, they weren't crazy. They were the brave Americans. I supported him. He lost. He let us down. But, you know, he lost. So, I never liked him as much after that, because I don't like losers. (LAUGHTER)TRUMP: But...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Let me get to it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's a war hero. TRUMP: He's not a war hero.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's a war hero, five-and-a-half years as a prisoner...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: He is a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured. OK? I hate to tell you. (CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Did you hear that? He's a war hero because he was captured. OK? You can have -- and I believe perhaps he's a war hero. (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Critics are piling on, especially those critics in the Republican establishment who would like to see Trump out of the race, and of course, his rivals.Rick Perry: ""He should immediately withdraw from the race for president.""Jeb Bush: ""Enough with the slanderous attacks.""The Republican National Committee: ""There is no place in our party or our country for comments that disparage those who have served honorably.""Is this selective outrage or will this be the moment that slows Trump's meteoric rise in the polls? Joining us now, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican from Florida, 2016 nominee. Thank you so much for joining us, Senator. I know you have heard these comments from Donald Trump. Governor Perry says these comments disqualify Trump to be commander in chief. Do you agree? SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I do agree. This is not just an insult to John McCain, who clearly is a war hero and a great man. But it's an insult to all POWs, to all men and women who have served us in uniform who have been captured in battle. And this somehow makes the assumption or he's saying that somehow if you're captured in battle, you're less worthy of honors than someone who isn't. It's not just absurd. It's offensive. It's ridiculous. And I do think it is a disqualifier as commander in chief. TAPPER: Now, some Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, have criticized you and your fellow Republican candidates for not speaking out more forcefully and more quickly after Trump's comments about undocumented immigrants. They wonder why this firestorm about McCain and not a firestorm about Mexicans? RUBIO: Well, there was. I spoke against what Donald Trump said. But we have to remember this is a man who spent his whole life saying outrageous things. So, early in his campaign, when he said something outrageous, people kind of said just ignore it and move on, it will go away. This is what he does for a living. I think now, as this has gone forward and he's become a more covered candidate and people pay more attention to him, it's required people to be more forceful on some of these offensive things that he's saying. But I did -- not only did I say that what he said about Mexicans is not just inaccurate, it's offensive, it's not true, and it's also offensive. But what he said yesterday, of course, is offensive about John McCain and inaccurate about John McCain, but it actually is offensive to all POWs, the men and women who serve us in uniform, especially those who have served time in the hands of enemy captors and who are worthy of our admiration and respect. TAPPER: Let's move on and discuss the deal President Obama announced to try to contain Iran's nuclear ambitions. Governor Scott Walker says he would rip up this deal on day one, Governor Jeb Bush says the next president would actually have to consult with his Cabinet and allies before throwing the deal out. What would President Marco Rubio do? RUBIO: Yes. Well, I think what people have to understand is that the American portion, the U.S. portion of the sanctions were passed by Congress. They are in the law today. The way the president is going to lift those sanctions is by the use of a national security waiver. The next president of the United States simply has to undo the use of the waiver.[09:05:08] And the sanctions are already in place. And they would be reinstated. And that's what I would do as president. You don't need to have a Cabinet fully formed to do that. In fact, I'm telling everyone now that, if I'm elected president of the United States, we will not use the national security waiver to hold back U.S. sanctions against Iran, especially not as a result of this flawed deal that he's pursuing. TAPPER: The deal, as you point out, lots of people can poke holes in it, lots of people can point out flaws. The Obama administration says, what's the alternative? They argue that this deal, and the sanctions, depend upon international cooperation.The Russians and Chinese were already talking about getting rid of sanctions. Is it not possible that this is simply the best deal any American president could have gotten? RUBIO: No, I don't think that's true. I think that the sanctions were actually forcing Iran to the table. I think we should have asked for a lot more. The sanctions -- this deal violates promises the president made to the American people on multiple fronts. It is not an anytime/anywhere inspection system. It is an inspection process that will require arbitration over a 24-day period or longer that Iran can fight against and delay things. It actually doesn't have a snap-back provision. It says if, in fact, sanctions are ever reimposed because Iran violates the constricts of this deal, any of the contracts that are already in place get to stay. It will only be sanctions on future contracts. So, it doesn't have a really -- it doesn't have a real snap-back provision. It also, by the way, requires us to help Iran technically, economically, develop themselves as a country and become a stronger regional power. That undermines our relationships with our Arab allies in the region and, of course, the state of Israel. And we could spend all day going through the different dynamics of this deal and how it doesn't go nearly far enough and I think almost guarantees that there will now be an arms race in the Middle East. TAPPER: But what would President Rubio do if allies didn't agree with it, which is what it sounds like the Chinese and Russians, the position they were taking? Would you impose sanctions on China or India for not sanctioning Iran? RUBIO: Well, first of all, I wouldn't call China and Russia allies. And, second, I would not -- our foreign policy as a nation is not subject to what China wants to do or Russia wants to do or the E.U. wants to do or anybody wants to do. We have our own foreign policy. It needs to be in the national security interests of the United States. I would never have entered this negotiation unless we understood up front that Iran was going to stop enrichment activities, was going to stop their ballistic missile capabilities, and was going to stop sponsoring terrorism. And none of these conditions have been met. And so now $150 billion is going to be delivered to the Iranian regime, which they will use a substantial portion of it to arm and support Hezbollah, to help Assad, and to help them carry out all sorts of terrorist activities, this to a government that has the blood of over 1,000 American servicemen on their hands, because they were the ones building the IEDs that killed a bunch of Americans in Iraq less than a decade ago. TAPPER: Let's turn to another matter of foreign policy. Tomorrow, here in Washington, D.C., the Cuban Embassy is going to open. This is, of course, part of President Obama's efforts to normalize relations with that country. You have made it very clear you oppose normalization. You have called President Obama's policy a victory for oppression. Would President Rubio shut down the Cuban Embassy here in Washington? RUBIO: I would end the diplomatic relations with an anti-American communist tyranny, until such time as they actually held a democratic opening in Cuba, allowed people to organize independent political parties, have freedom of the press and freedom of expression. In fact, all these conditions are laid out in the law right now in the Cuban Democracy Act. The president in his opening towards Cuba is violating existing law. He is ignoring existing law. And there are a host of conditions that would have to be met before, under my administration, we would have normal relations with Cuba. And that would include the return of fugitives from American justice that are now in Cuba, and that would require the political openings that I have outlined. And that would also require an ending of the intelligence facilities inside of Cuba by both the Russians and the Chinese that use the island of Cuba to spy against American facilities in the Southeast United States. TAPPER: So -- and -- so I'm assuming, amidst all that, the U.S. Embassy -- I mean, the Cuban Embassy in Washington would be shut down because you would end diplomatic relations.RUBIO: Well, they -- look, they have had an interests section there for years, and that function will continue. I don't think -- other than their parties being better attended, I'm not sure what the difference is going to be between what we had before and what we have now, except that this recognition somehow sends a message to dissidents and others around the world that the United States accepts the Cuban form of government today as a legitimate form of government. I do not. I believe the people of Cuba deserve what everyone else in the Western hemisphere has, democracy. TAPPER: Let's turn to immigration for a second. [09:10:01] I know this might be a bit awkward, because you just defended him very strongly, but Senator John McCain had some not-so-nice words for you in a recent interview with ""The New Yorker"" magazine. The two of you worked together on immigration reform in the Senate, of course.But when asked about your leadership style, McCain -- quote -- ""licked his finger, held it up in the air and laughed, referring to which way the wind blows. He said, 'Rubio backed away from it.'""I wanted to give you an opportunity to respond. RUBIO: That was just John McCain being John McCain, because, at the end of the day, is -- that bill had no chance to pass in the House. I repeatedly warned to the people working with me -- you can go back and see the record -- I told them, if this bill is not stronger on the enforcement front, it will go nowhere. That's exactly how it played out. And, as a result, we have made no progress on immigration reform. I warned everybody about that during that process. Every time I would warn people about it, they said I was trying to unravel the process. I was being honest with them. There was no way this bill was going to pass unless the enforcement aspects of it were clearer and stronger. They were not strong enough. That's why today we have less votes for that bill than we did even two years ago. And that's why, while I continue to want to move forward on immigration, I know that the only way we can move forward on it is to first secure our borders, prevent visa overstays and have an E- Verify system. And only after we do that can we do the other two things I believe we need to do, modernize our legal immigration system and deal with those who have been here for a long time illegally, in a reasonable and responsible way. TAPPER: Let's talk about the way to deal with people who have been here for a long time in a responsible and reasonable way. I want to play the quick exchange you had with a voter last month in New Hampshire. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you support a path to citizenship for immigrants who are in the United States, but are here illegally? RUBIO: I do. But, first, we have to do two things. (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: And, obviously, those two things, securing the border and the E-Verify system. RUBIO: Right. Right. TAPPER: That's still your position, though, a path to citizenship once those other things have been taken care of? RUBIO: Yes. Well, what I said is, if all we can get is a work permit, it is better than what we have now. There are some that do not support that. But you have to understand what a path to citizenship is. I don't think that's ever carefully explained. Before you can ever be a citizen, you have to be a permanent resident. That means a green card. And you have to be in that status for three to five years. And what I have argued is, if you have violated our laws, you should not be allowed to apply for a green card for at least 10 years. And then, when you apply for a green card, you should have to do it through the normal, regular process, not through a special process created for you. So it could take a long time for someone to ultimately apply for citizenship. But I think that's a fair way to do it. It should not be cheaper or faster to become a citizen by having come here illegally. But, ultimately, it's my opinion -- and I understand some people disagree -- that you don't want millions of people permanently living in this country who can never become Americans. But if the best we can do is to stop at the green card process or at the work permit process, that's still better than what we have now. TAPPER: There seems to be a big chasm in economic policy that came out over the last few days I wanted to ask you about. Secretary of State -- former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took on what she called the sharing economy, companies such as Uber and Lyft that use contractors, not employees. In your book, you have a chapter entitled ""Making America Safe for Uber,"" and you're embracing these companies. What's wrong with Hillary Clinton's push to encourage companies like Uber to offer health insurance, offer benefits? RUBIO: Because she's trapped in yesterday. She's trying to apply 20th century constricts to a 21st century innovative industry. We face this over and over again. We're trying to regulate Internet development the way we regulated telephony, you know, telephone systems 20 years ago. You cannot regulate 21st century industries with 20th century ideas. The pace of innovation is too quick. If I had explained to you what Uber was five years ago, it would have been impossible, 10 years ago, completely impossible. The pace of change is so fast that the ability of government to keep up with it, it just can't. And her take on Airbnb, Lyft, Uber, these sorts of things is a perfect example of someone who's trapped in the past, and cannot understand how much the world is changing, and how much it's going to change in the years to come economically. TAPPER: Senator Marco Rubio, thank you so much. RUBIO: Thank you. TAPPER: President Obama announced his landmark nuclear deal with Iran, but it does not include bringing U.S. hostages home. Why not? I will ask the secretary of state, John Kerry, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [09:18:20] TAPPER: Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, called the landmark nuclear deal announced this week a victory for Iran. Khamenei's endorsement will not soothe critics here in America or U.S. allies such as Saudi Arabia or Israel. As President Obama faces a tough battle on Capitol Hill to defend this deal, its American architects, Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz, insist there is simply no viable alternative. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)TAPPER: So it was just a few days ago that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs testified before Congress that lifting the ballistic missile or conventional arms embargo from Iran, that lifting it would be a horrible idea. That was within the same context of testimony that Iran had killed an estimated 500 Americans. Why is lifting the embargo part of this deal? JOHN KERRY, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We're not lifting it. It has eight years out a 10-year component of the U.N. resolution. Eight years, it will be applied. And we have other U.N. resolutions and other mechanisms for holding Iran accountable on missiles. But the simple reality is, Jake, this U.N. process that started the -- that allowed the sanctions to be put in place in the first place contemplated the lifting of all sanctions once Iran had lived up to its obligations with respect to the NPT. So, if the IAEA found in X-number of years that they have lived up to this, then all the sanctions would be gone. So, we, in fact, succeeded against three countries that didn't think they should have to do anything. So, we have a lot of measures.[09:20:02] And the United States always has the ability to take action, unilaterally or otherwise, with respect to other activities. TAPPER: Why I'm confused about this, Secretary Moniz, is because, when I interviewed you in April, and I asked about the four Americans being held in Iran against their will, three that we know, one we don't know what happened to him, and you said the following:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ERNEST MONIZ, U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY: What I want to emphasize is, this negotiation was intentionally restricted to the nuclear issue, get the nuclear bomb issue off the table, we hope, for a long time. That has other implications. So, for example, things like arms embargoes, ballistic missile sanctions, those stay in place, strictly focused on the nuclear issues. (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: But that doesn't seem to have been what happened. MONIZ: Well, I think we are -- the part of the agreement that is absolutely critical is that, of course, which allows us to, A, prevent a weapon and to have visibility in to any activity in this -- in this direction. Excuse me.And with regard to the Americans unjustly held or missing, again, the secretary -- I was there -- every meeting, this was always raised, and remains, I think, an area of considerable focus. TAPPER: I don't doubt that for a second. But when I asked you about it, you said, look, this is just focused on the nuclear issue. We're not dealing with anything else, including hostages, including arms embargoes. And it looks like, since that happened, the Iranian got to include something that was extraneous, and we did not when it came to our hostages. MONIZ: Well, of course, the arms embargo -- and I will defer to John, but the arms embargo is something that was directly tied to the nuclear performance. KERRY: It was not extraneous. It was already in there. The arms embargo and the missile were put in when 1929, the resolution, was passed. TAPPER: What do you say when you hear that Prince Bandar, the longtime former ambassador from Saudi Arabia, said that this deal -- quote -- ""will wreak havoc in the Middle East""?As you know, there are a lot of countries, Sunni Arab countries, Israel, that are very worried that this is actually a bad deal for peace in the region. KERRY: Well, we disagree with them very, very much. I disagree with him. But I just yesterday met with the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, who said on television that if the -- they want a deal, and if the deal does the things -- they listed things the deal does -- then they would feel very comfortable with it. The fact is that the real fear of that region should be that you don't have the deal. If Congress doesn't pass this, if Congress were to kill this, then we have no inspections, we have no sanctions, we have no ability to negotiate, because I assure you the ayatollah, if the United States arbitrarily and unilaterally kills this, you're not going to have another negotiation. And they will feel free to go do the very things that this prevents. TAPPER: I have spoken to a lot of experts, ones who wanted this deal to be good, who were rooting for you, and they say the best-case scenario is that, over the next 15 years, with the $100 billion from the money that has no longer -- that will no longer be covered under sanctions, the Iranians will be closer to the capacity to build a nuclear weapon with the $100 billion that they now will have after sanctions are lifted, and they will have done it all under the guise of international law. KERRY: You see, the reason that's not accurate about what will happen is that, today, we don't have those inspections. I mean, we do now under the interim agreement. But, before the interim agreement, we didn't have them. We didn't have the ability to know what they were doing. And guess what, my friend? Iran had 12,000 kilograms of highly enriched uranium, and -- and that's enough, if they enriched it further, for 10 to 12 bombs. They had it. That's what Barack Obama was dealt as a hand when he came in, 19,000 centrifuges already spinning, a country that had already mastered the fuel cycle, a country that already was threshold, in the sense that they are only two months away from breakout. So, we're expanding that breakout from those two months to one year for 10 years and longer. And we have lifetime inspection, adherence to the IAEA, adherence to the advanced protocol, 25 years of tracking and monitoring their uranium, from mining, to milling, to yellow cake, to gas, to centrifuge, to waste. That's unprecedented. And we would not have had that without this agreement. TAPPER: Last time I saw you, sir, I did ask if you had any inklings of getting back in the presidential campaign... KERRY: None. TAPPER: ... mode. KERRY: Zero. (CROSSTALK) KERRY: Absolutely none whatsoever. I have a great job. We have a lot of work to do in the next year-and- a-half, and I'm looking forward to it. TAPPER: That's about as close to Shermanesque as I think it gets. (LAUGHTER) TAPPER: Thank you so much. I appreciate it to both of you.KERRY: Thank you. You're welcome. (END VIDEOTAPE)TAPPER: When we come back: the newest Republican presidential candidate, Governor Scott Walker, cruising in his Winnebago through Iowa, though that is not to say he doesn't hit a speed bump or two. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WALKER: I don't have an opinion on every single issue out there. I mean, to me that's -- I don't know. I don't know the answer to that question. (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[09:29:25] TAPPER: Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker entered the presidential race this week at the top of the polls in neighboring Iowa, at least, the first-in-the-nation caucus state, where his Midwestern roots and conservative positions seem to be resonating. He spent this week crisscrossing the Hawkeye State in a Winnebago, with CNN's own Dana Bash in tow -- Dana.BASH: Well, Jake, I was, in fact, invited on Scott Walker's R.V. He was racing between campaign stops in Iowa. And while we were there, I asked him about his comment that he would tear up the Iran nuclear deal on day one of his presidency, and whether that's realistic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BASH: Would you be willing to go ahead and do away with this deal, increase sanctions, even if all of the other allies around the world, really, were opposed to that? GOV. SCOTT WALKER (R-WI), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes.And I think it's that bad of a deal. It's a bad deal for us. It's a bad deal for Israel. It's a bad deal for the region.I will not -- it's not just the starting gun, it will accelerate the nuclear arms race, and it is a powering Iran to do what they're going to do by lifting the sanctions, giving them credibility in the world, not only emboldens the problems that we have in terms of the illicit nuclear infrastructure but this is the leading state sponsor of terrorism.BASH: But the U.S. can't lead in a vacuum, right? WALKER: No. And we certainly would not want to.Our intention would not be to do it alone. I would seek to get the support of Congress not just to reinstate the existing sanctions, but to replace more crippling ones (INAUDIBLE) I think if America would lead and make the case as to why these sanctions are needed and why we need to petition in that regard (INAUDIBLE) -- (CROSSTALK)BASH: The reason the sanctions were so beneficial and so effective, is because the whole world joined in on them. WALKER: Exactly. BASH: If the U.S. was going it alone with sanctions, Iran would say, all right, U.S., whatever, we can, you know, still trade with everybody else. So it wouldn't really work, would it? WALKER: Well, I mean there are still fundamental parts related to the United States. And again the United States putting sanctions, it would have an impact on them. So they'd have to consider what impact it would have on relations that they do with Iran and what that would impact to have on their own account. BASH: Earlier this week you said that the Boy Scouts of America should keep its ban on gay leaders because the policy protected children and (INAUDIBLE) scout values. And then your campaign clarified to say that it was really protecting the scouts from the political and media discussion about that.I'm having trouble understanding that. What -- at the end of the day what is your position? WALKER: I'm not talking about personal protection. I'm talking about -- for me the reason why I didn't have a problem with it is I just think it pulled scouting into a whole larger political and cultural debate as opposed to saying scouting is about camping and citizenship and merit badge and service awards instead of pulling all these other issues out there. And I just hope that they (ph) can (ph) stay focused. That's all. BASH: So, but should there be a ban on allowing gay men to be scout leaders? WALKER: That's up to the people who run the boy scouts.One thing that people find unique, I guess, whether you like it or not, is I actually answer questions. People ask me a question, I'll answer a question -- BASH: You're not really answering this one. WALKER: Sure. I said in this case that's what I thought. I thought the policy was just fine. BASH: OK.WALKER: I (ph) was (ph) saying (ph) when I was in scouts it was fine. You're asking what should the policy be going forward? It should be left up to the leaders of the scouts. BASH: Do you think that being gay is a choice? WALKER: Oh, I mean I think -- that's not even an issue for me to be involved in. The bottom line is, I'm going to stand up and work hard for every American regardless of who they are, no matter where they come from, no matter what their background. I'm going to fight for people and no matter whether they vote for me or not.(CROSSTALK)BASH: On behalf of people is to do that properly you have to understand or at least have an opinion on who they are and where they're coming from. WALKER: But again, I think -- no I don't have an opinion on every single issue out there. I mean to me that's -- I don't know. I don't know the answer to that question.So I'm just saying (INAUDIBLE) I don't know what the answer to that is. And again I'm going to spend my time focused on things that I do know and what I can work on. BASH: You have taken an interesting position in that you say that legal immigration should be limited. Why is that? And does that -- you know some people might look at that and say that's completely counter to what America was founded on.WALKER: What I specifically said is I think priority under legal immigration should be given to the impact on American working families, on their wages in a way that will improve the American economy.That only means people like me who were born here, that means people like the woman I just met in Cedar Rapids, for example, who moved here many years ago, was a political refugee in the Congo and who went through the process to be a legal citizen. She is working here. And I believe for her and for others who were born here, there needs to be a priority given to say we're going to do things that makes sure we put priority on American working families and their wages. Doesn't mean there won't ever be legal immigration. It just says that's where our priority should be. BASH: You want path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and then you say now that you changed your mind. You believe in amnesty. You're running as somebody who is principled and authentic. How do you square changing your positions or at least the impression that your positions have changed?(CROSSTALK) BASH: And let me read you one quick thing. Craig Robinson who is the former director of the party here in Iowa, the Republican Party said, Walker is making Romney look like the model of consistency.[09:34: 43] WALKER: The only issue where I've clearly said I had a position before and even on that as a governor I didn't have a role to play in immigration. I said there should be a path years ago, when I talked about going forward with legal immigration. I didn't talk about amnesty. Like I said in that specific interview I oppose the Gang of Five, the measure that Marco Rubio and others proposed. So I explicitly even then said, I'm not supporting that.But I said flat out in the interview, you heard the beginning of the year, that's the position I have changed on by listening to people. I made it very clear what my position on immigration is.(END VIDEOTAPE)TAPPER: Dana Bash on Scott Walker's R.V. Somewhere between Cedar Rapids and Urbandale.Don't go anywhere, Dana. We're going to bring in the rest of the panel. We're going to talk Trump.Will his latest comments give Republicans an excuse to try to push him off the debate stage? Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)TAPPER: President Obama, girding for a fight as Congress signals it will try to block his Iran nuclear deal. The best political team on television is here to break it all down.CNN contributor Donna Brazile, Peter Baker of ""The New York Times,"" CNN's Dana Bash and Congressman William Hurd of Texas. Thanks one and all for being here.[09:40:00] So, one of the big controversial provisions that's not in this deal is this anywhere, anytime provision. What the administration says, the Obama administration says in response is, look, this 24-day leeway period we can find, intelligence officials tell us that we can find if there were nuclear materials there even 24 days later. You're a former CIA agent. Is that true? Is 24 days, will we still be able to detect?REP. WILL HURD (R), TEXAS: It shouldn't be 24 days. Anytime, anywhere means just that.And you know, the problem with this deal is that there's been absolutely no confidence building measures with Iran. How can we trust them to do what they say they're going to do? And being able to get in to see their facilities at any time, any place, makes sure that we understand what's going on.TAPPER: But is it possible that the radiation detectors will be able to find out if they've been up to no good even 24 days later?HURD: I'm sure in some forms it can but also they can move a lot of -- you can move a lot of material in 24 days, as well.TAPPER: Dana, where is this on the Hill (ph) right now? BASH: In trouble. And when I say that what I mean is I think it seems to be clear, unless the administration really performs a miracle, that there are votes to initially, if they want to, say that they don't agree with this and that it shouldn't go through.The question is whether or not there is a veto- proof majority to do that. And that is what the administration is working incredibly hard to try to push. And you know, this really is a bipartisan thing, because there are Democrats with Republicans who are very much opposed to this.The administration had Jewish Americans in -- Jewish members of Congress rather in the situation room this past week. They're going after, I mean probably they have a list of, you know, every member of Congress who is 5'5"" and under. I mean, they have little groups of members trying desperately to go piece by piece to try to lobby them and they have their work cut out for them.DONNA BRAZILE, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, you know, this is a major international agreement. And with any international agreement there are pluses and there are minuses.But on the plus side I do believe that the administration will be able to keep the Democrats 152 House Democrats signed an agreement basically with the framework saying that they like the outlines of a deal. Now clearly the administration will have to continue to maintain the strong support not just of the Democrats in the House, but also the Senate.I was telling Dana I've been, you know, a great fan and supporter -- yes I'm a fan of the administration, support the president. I've never been lobbied as much as I've been lobbied over the last couple of days. The good news is that they're giving us information. Credible information not just about the inspections, not just about the lifting of the sanctions, the amount of money, whether or not Iran will become a, you know, a good player in the region.They're giving us information and I'm sure they're giving it to those of us who are talkers. They're giving it to members of Congress and their staff as they go back this summer and come back to support this deal. PETER BAKER, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, ""THE NEW YORK TIMES"": (INAUDIBLE) watching (ph) the president this week at his press conference about this and you saw a president who actually was engaging in a fight. He did actually want to talk about criticism when the reporters didn't come up with enough criticism he said hey let's think of some other criticisms that I can address here.You don't see a president actually -- usually... (CROSSTALK)BAKER: ...for criticism (INAUDIBLE). And the reason I think is because, finally, for him, after many months, even a year or more of being on the defensive on issues that weren't of his creation or weren't of his desire to talk about, IRS, or Benghazi, or ISIS, he's talking about something that is at least something he wants to talk about. Something he hopes will be a positive legacy in the long-term. And that's the debate he wants to have. TAPPER: There are a lot of Democrats, congressman, who say Republicans are just going to oppose Obama on anything. And so we're not surprised that they're opposing him on this. HURD: But there's a lot of Democrats that are opposing him on this, as well. I think a bad move was taking this to the U.N. before getting an agreement from your entire -- from the entire government. And that's something that has frustrated a lot of Democrats in Congress.And so, at the end of the day they've never known any information why would the Iranians actually agree to this? They've agreed to these measures before. The IAEA, the U.N. watchdog has done 30 inspections from 2003 to 2010. And they found out that the Iranians were lying to them and that caused four more sanctions going forward. So the Iranians have done this before and we have no information, no confidence building measures that say that they're not going to do it again. [09:44:23] TAPPER: Let's take a quick break.Republicans rushing to condemn Donald Trump after his latest comments anger veterans. But who still has his back? The answer might surprise you.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know, I recognize that folks in the press love to see Republican-on-Republican violence. And so you want me to say something bad about Donald Trump or bad about John McCain or bad about anyone else. I'm not going to do it.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz of Texas refusing to pile on to the Donald Trump's scenario as so many of his rivals seem to do. Rather, enthusiastically yesterday, and earlier in the show. Let's talk it all over with our roundtable.Peter, let me ask you this, I could have predicted, I feel, that Trump was going to say something controversial and the entire Republican establishment was going to jump on him. I didn't know what it was going to be. But boy does the RNC want him away. [09:49:41] BAKER: Yes. Because every minute we're talking about Donald trump and some outrageous thing he said, A, it cheapens the process. It makes it look like a reality show rather than a serious, sober contest for the presidency of the United States. And, B, it means we're not talking about all the failings that President Obama, that they'd like to talk about, right?I mean, they'd like to get out there and talk about how this administration and his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, have failed in this way and that way. Instead they're talking about, you know, Donald trump and the latest crazy thing that he might have said. TAPPER: Except to play devil's advocate here, Dana.BASH: Yes.TAPPER: He has brought up the issue of immigration that a lot of Republicans are worried about talking about, but a lot of the base loves to talk about.BASH: Absolutely. I mean, there's a very good reason why he is doing so well. It's not just because he is incredibly entertaining it's because he's talking about something that a lot of the base were frustrated that the other candidates didn't want to talk about.But I just actually want to say something that may be counterintuitive in that, you know, historically you just don't go there. You don't go there against any veteran. You'd certainly don't go there against somebody who was, you know, effectively, you know, in a box for five years.And you know, John McCain can't even lift his arms...TAPPER: Right because he was tortured.BASH: ...because he was tortured and because his bones didn't heal right after his plane crash. Having said that, I think that there's a big part of the electorate, bigger than we think, that isn't that offended by these comments because they are equally frustrated with the John McCains of the world on the issue of immigration.So, I think, you know, a few years ago it would have been lights out Donald Trump. And I'm not so sure that's the case anymore (ph). [09:51:13] TAPPER: Well, let me ask you about that -- Congressman Hurd, I want to ask you as the Republican at the table. I have heard from a lot of Democrats who only 11 years ago in 2004 when John Kerry was the nominee of the Democratic Party (INAUDIBLE) -- let's see if we can show the pictures -- the Republican National Convention.There's somebody with a band-aid that is representing -- mocking John Kerry's three purple hearts and then one of the standard bearers of the Republican Party came on CNN and said this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT DOLE (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: With three purple hearts and never bled that I know of. And they're all superficial wounds.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: And Bob Dole went on to later kind of walk those comments back a little. But is there a double standard here? Republicans they say, there's no place in our party or country for comments that disparage those who have served honorably. Well, unless you're a Democrat. HURD: You don't criticize anybody's service. Somebody that is willing to go overseas, put their lives in harm's way in order for all of us to sleep well at night, you don't disparage that. I don't care what party you're in. TAPPER: Donna?BRAZILE: I totally agree with the congressman. Yet, I remember 2004.But look, I think the Republicans are struggling with excommunicating Donald Trump and some Republicans are trying to embrace him. Just in case he drops out, they want to, you know, be able to accrue those votes.They have a real branding problem with Hispanics and they have been working on it for years the Republicans. And now -- here comes this big celebrity. He's a celebrity now.TAPPER: Sure.BRAZILE: But he's a celebrity with a huge following because he's standing up to the establishment, but he's also blocking I think some of the sunshine that some of the other Republicans like Mr. Kasich, Mr. Rubio and others, they would like to have this moment in the sun so they can qualify for the first debate.TAPPER: So, let me turn to another inter party warfare which is (ph) the (ph) Democratic Party. There was a Netroots Nation convention, a gathering of liberal activists in Phoenix and there was a moment where one of the Democratic presidential candidate former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley was shouted down when he said ""all lives matter"" and a question about, Black Lives Matter. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARTIN O'MALLEY (D), FORMER BALTIMORE MAYOR: Every life matters and that is why this issue is so important. Black lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter.Black lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: I read a column on a liberal blog saying that he was using the language of white supremacy. Can you explain why people would be mad at somebody saying, all lives matter? BRAZILE: Well first of all I don't approve and I don't condone shouting down anyone because I do believe that when these speakers -- these presidential candidates come, they want to be heard. And clearly I like the back and forth.That being said, there's a real cry out there, a cry from a generation that wants to be heard, that feel crushed by the street violence that they're experiencing, and the unjust police tactics that they are also experiencing. So they want to be heard and they don't want to be grouped together with ""all lives matter.""They want candidates to understand their pain, their frustration. They've attended too many funerals, and they are not going to allow candidates to come in and pander without addressing these issues. One in particular is the woman who was killed while -- I don't know the circumstances, so I apologize for that.TAPPER: Ms. (ph) Bland (ph) found dead --(CROSSTALK)BRAZILE: Ms. Bland who was really one of the heroes behind the Black Lives Matter. So, there's a lot of frustration.And I would advise candidates, Democrats and Republicans to figure out what's going on. Because if they decide to go on the stage and not address these issues, they will shout them down.[09:54:52] TAPPER: Figure out what's going on, good words to live by. Peter, Donna, Congressman, Dana, thank you so much.After the break, join me at my giant wall of cartoons for this week's ""State of the Cartoonion.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[09:59:02] TAPPER: Over the weekend, the president and his family took in the awesome hip-hop Broadway musical ""Hamilton"" based on the life of the first treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton, long remembered for his death by duel with Vice President Aaron Burr. But the most persistent reminder of Hamilton's place in history is now up for debate and he may have to pay the price.This week's ""State of the Cartoonion.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER (voice-over): American currency from your George Washingtons to your Ben Franklins. It seems you don't have to be president to get on a greenback, you just have to be an old dead white guy, historically important, of course.But now we're told the U.S. government is moving to bring a woman into the mix. We're told it will start with the $10.00 bill, founding father Alexander Hamilton will have to share it with some lucky female historical figures. But others dream of more permanent replacements. [10:00:00] There might be something poetic about replacing President Andrew Jackson nicknamed Indian Killer with Sacagawea, who accompanied Lewis and Clark as a guide, an (ph) interpreter.On the rarely used $1,000.00 bill is progressive icon President Woodrow Wilson. He was also something of a nasty racist. Let's put his contemporary suffrage Alice Paul on that bill. And while we all love Benjamin Franklin it's pretty clear he already gets plenty of love.What if abolitionists and women's rights activists Sojourner Truth were to be on the (INAUDIBLE). It has a nice ring to it. It's all about the Sojourners baby.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Thanks for spending your Sunday morning with us.""FAREED ZAKARIA GPS,"" starts right now."
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/10/barack-obama/Three-Republicans-Cabinet-Most/	"""Putting three Republicans in my Cabinet...is unprecedented."""	true	['History']	http://www.nytimes.com/	http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/09/us/politics/09text-obama.html?_r=1	2009/02/10	"And that is why the single most important part of this Economic Recoveryand Reinvestment Plan is the fact that it will save or create up to 4million jobs, because that's what America needs most right now. It is absolutely true that we can't depend on government alone to create jobs or economic growth. That is and must be the roleof the private sector. But at this particular moment, with theprivate sector so weakened by this recession, the federal government isthe only entity left with the resources to jolt our economy backinto life. It is only government that can break the vicious cyclewhere lost jobs lead to people spending less money, which leads to evenmore layoffs. And breaking that cycle is exactly what the planthat's moving through Congress is designed todo. When passed, this plan will ensure thatAmericans who'velost their jobs through no fault of their own can receivegreater unemployment benefits and continue their health carecoverage. We will also provide a $2,500 tax credit to folks who are strugglingto pay the cost of their college tuition, and $1,000 worth ofbadly needed tax relief to working and middle-class families. Thesesteps will put more money in the pockets of those Americans who aremost likely to spend it, and that will help break the cycle and getour economymoving. But as we've learned very clearly andconclusively over the last eight years, tax cuts alone can't solve all of our economicproblems -- especially tax cuts that are targeted to the wealthiestfew Americans. We have tried that strategy, time and time again. And it'sonly helped lead us to the crisis we face rightnow. And that's why we have come together,around a plan that combines hundreds of billions in tax cuts for the middle class withdirect investment in areas like health care, energy, educationand infrastructure, investments that will save jobs, create new jobsand new businesses and help our economy grow again, now and in thefuture. More than 90 percent of the jobs createdby this plan will be in the private sector. They're not going to be make-work jobsbut jobs doing the work that America desperately needs done, jobsrebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, repairing our dangerouslydeficient dams and levees, so that we don't face anotherKatrina. They'll be jobs building the wind turbinesand solar panels and fuel-efficient cars that will lower our dependence on foreign oiland modernizing our costly health care system that will save usbillions of dollars and countlesslives. They'll be jobs creating the 21st-centuryclassrooms, libraries and labs for millions of children across America. And they'llbe the jobs of firefighters and teachers and police officers that would otherwise be eliminated, if we do not provide states with somerelief. Now after many weeks of debate and discussion, the planthat ultimately emerges from Congress must be big enough and bold enoughto meet the size of the economic challenges that we face rightnow. It's a plan that is already supported by businesses representingalmost every industry in America, by both the Chamber of Commerce andthe AFL-CIO. It contains input, ideas and compromises from bothDemocrats and Republicans. It also contains an unprecedented levelof transparency and accountability, so that every American will beable to go online and see where and how we're spending everydime. What it does not contain, however, is asingle pet project, not a single earmark, and it has been stripped of the projects membersof both parties found mostobjectionable. Now despite all of this, the plan's notperfect. No plan is. I can't tell you for sure that everything in this plan will workexactly as we hope, but I can tell you with complete confidence that afailure to act will only deepen this crisis, as well as the pain feltby millions ofAmericans. My administration inherited a deficit ofover $1 trillion,but because we also inherited the most profound economic emergencysince the Great Depression, doing little or nothing at all will resultin ever -- even greater deficits, even greater job loss, even greater loss of income and even greater loss of confidence. Those are deficits that could turn a crisis into a catastrophe, and I refuse to let that happen. As long as I hold this office, Iwill do whatever it takes to put this economy back on track and putthis country back towork. I want to thank the members of Congresswho've worked so hard to move this plan forward. But I also want to urge all membersof Congress to act without delay in the coming week to resolvetheir differences and pass thisplan. We find ourselves in a rare moment wherethe citizens of our country and all countries are watching and waiting for us tolead. It's a responsibility that this generation did not ask for, butone that we must accept for the future of our children andour grandchildren. The strongest democracies flourish fromfrequent and lively debate, but they endure when people of every background andbelief find a way to set aside smaller differences in service of agreater purpose. That's the test facing the United States of Americain this winter of our hardship, and it is our duty as leaders and citizensto stay -- stay true to that purpose in the weeks and monthsahead. After a day of speaking with and listeningto the fundamentally decent men and women who call this nation home, I have full faithand confidence that we can do it. But we're going to have to work together. That's what I intend to promote in the weeks and days ahead. And with that, I'll take some of your questions. And let mego to Jennifer Loven at AP. There youare. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President. Earlier today in Indianayou said something striking. You said that this nation could endup in a crisis, without action, that we would be unable to reverse. Can you talk about what you know or what you're hearing that would lead youto say that our recession might be permanent when others in ourhistory have not? And do you think that you risk losing somecredibility or even talking down the economy by using dire language likethat? MR. OBAMA: No, no, no,no. I think that what I've said is what other economists have said across the political spectrum,which is that if you delay acting on an economy of this severity, thenyou potentially create a negative spiral that becomes much moredifficult for us to get outof. We saw this happen in Japan in the 1990s,where they did notact boldly and swiftly enough, and as a consequence they suffered whatwas called the ""lost decade,"" where essentially for theentire '90s, they did not see any significant economicgrowth. So what I'm trying to underscore is whatthe people in Elkhart already understand, that this is not your ordinary,run-of-the-mill recession. We are going through the worst economic crisis since theGreat Depression. We've lost now 3.6 million jobs. Butwhat's perhaps even more disturbing is that almost half of that job loss has taken placeover the last three months, which means that the problems areaccelerating instead of getting better. Now, what I said in Elkhart today is whatI'll repeat this evening, which is I'm absolutely confident that we can solvethis problem, but it's going to require us to take somesignificant, importantsteps. Step number one, we have to pass aneconomic recovery and reinvestment plan. And we've made progress. There was avote this evening that moved the process forward in the Senate. Wealready have a House bill that's passed. I'm hoping over the next severaldays that the House and the Senate can reconcile their differences andget that bill on mydesk. There have been criticisms from a bunch ofdifferent directions about this bill. So let me just address a few ofthem. Some of the criticisms really are with thebasic idea that government should intervene at all in this moment of crisis. You have some people, very sincere, who philosophically just think the government has no business interfering in the marketplace. And in fact there are several who have suggested that FDR was wrong to intervene back in the New Deal. They're fighting battles thatI thought were resolved a pretty long timeago. Most economists, almost unanimously,recognize that evenif philosophically you're -- you're wary of government intervening inthe economy, when you have the kind of problem we have right now --what started on Wall Street goes to Main Street, suddenly businessescan't get credit, they start paring back their investment, they startlaying off workers, workers start pulling back in terms of spending --that when you have that situation, that government is an importantelement of introducing some additional demand into the economy. Westand to lose about $1 trillion worth of demand this year and anothertrillion next year, and what that means is you've got this gaping hole inthe economy. That's why the -- the figure that weinitially came up with, of approximately $800 billion, was put forward. That wasn't justsome random number that I plucked out of -- out of a hat. Thatwas Republican and Democratic, conservative and liberal economists thatI spoke to, who indicated that given the magnitude of the crisis andthe fact that it's happening worldwide, it's important for us to havea bill of sufficient size and scope that we can save or create 4million jobs. That still means that you're going to have some net jobloss, but at least we can start slowing the trend and moving it in theright direction. Now, the recovery and reinvestment packageis not the only thing we have to do. It's one leg of the stool. We are stillgoing to have to make sure that we are attracting private capital, get thecredit markets flowing again, because that's the lifeblood of theeconomy. And so tomorrow my Treasury secretary, Tim Geithner, will be announcing some very clear and specific plans for how we are goingto start loosening up credit once again. And that means having some transparency and oversight in the system. It means that we correct some of themistakes, with TARP, that were made earlier, the lack of consistency, the lack of clarity,in terms of how the program was going to moveforward. It means that we condition taxpayerdollars that arebeing provided, to the banks, on them showing some restraint when itcomes to executive compensation, not using the money to chartercorporate jets when they're notnecessary. It means that we focus on housing and howare we going to help homeowners that are suffering foreclosure or homeowners who arestill making their mortgage payments but are seeing their property values decline. So there's going to be a whole range ofapproaches that we have to take for dealing with the economy. My bottom line is tomake sure that we are saving or creating 4 million jobs, we are making surethat the financial system is working again, that homeowners aregetting somerelief. And I'm happy to get good ideas fromacross the political spectrum, from Democrats and Republicans. What I won't do is return to the failed theories of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place, becausethose theories have been tested and they have failed. And that'spart of what the election in November was all about. Okay? Caren Bohan ofReuters. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President. I'd like to shift gearsto foreign policy. What is your strategy for engaging Iran, andwhen will you start to implement it? Will your time table beaffected at all by the Iranian elections? And are you getting anyindications that Iran is interested in a dialogue with the UnitedStates? MR. OBAMA: I said during thecampaign that Iran is a country that has extraordinary people, extraordinary historyand traditions, but that its actions over many years now havebeen unhelpful when it comes to promoting peace and prosperity both inthe region and around the world; that their attacks or -- or their-- their financing of terrorist organizations like Hezbollah andHamas, the bellicose language that they've used towards Israel,their development of a nuclear weapon or their pursuit of a nuclearweapon -- that all of those things create the possibility ofdestabilizing the region and are not only contrary to our interests, but I thinkare contrary to the interests of international peace. What I've also said is that we should take an approach with Iran that employs all of the resources at the United States' disposal,and that includes diplomacy. And so my national security teamis currently reviewing our existing Iran policy, looking at areaswhere we can have constructive dialogue, where we can directly engagewith them. And my expectation is, in the coming months, we will belooking for openings that can be created where we can start sitting acrossthe table, face to face; of diplomatic overtures that will allow usto move our policy in a new direction. There's been a lot of mistrust built up over the years, so it's not going to happen overnight. And it's important that even as we engagein this direct diplomacy, we are very clear about certain deep concerns that wehave as a country, that Iran understands that we find the fundingof terrorist organizations unacceptable, that we're clear about thefact that a nuclear Iran could set off a nuclear arms race in theregion that would be profoundly destabilizing. So there are going tobe a set of objectives that we have in these conversations, but Ithink that there's the possibility, at least, of a relationship ofmutual respect andprogress. And I think that if you look at howwe've approached theMiddle East, my designation of George Mitchell as a special envoy tohelp deal with the Arab-Israeli situation, some of the interviews thatI've given, it indicates the degree to which we want to dothings differently in the region. Now it's time for Iran to sendsome signals that it wants to act differently as well and recognizethat even as it is has some rights as a member of theinternational community, with those rights come responsibilities. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President. You have often said that bipartisanship isextraordinarily important overall and in this stimulus package. But now whenwe ask your advisers about the lack of bipartisanship so far -- zero votesin the House, three in the Senate -- they say, well, it's not thenumber of votes that matters; it's the number of jobs that will becreated. Is that a sign that you are moving away,your White House is moving away, from this emphasis on bipartisanship? And whatwent wrong? Did you underestimate how hard it would be to changethe way Washingtonworked? MR. OBAMA: I don't think -- Idon't think I underestimated it. I don't think the American people underestimatedit. They understand that there have been a lot of bad habits built up herein Washington. And it's going to take time to break down some ofthose badhabits. You know, when I made a series ofovertures to the Republicans -- going over to meet with both Republican caucuses, you know,putting three Republicans in my Cabinet, something that is unprecedented, making sure that they were invited here to the White House, totalk about the economic recovery plan -- all those were not designedsimply to get some short-term votes. They were designed to try tobuild up some trust over time. And I think that, as I continue to make these overtures, over time, hopefully that will be reciprocated. But understand the bottom line that I'vegot right now, which is what's happening to the people of Elkhart and what's happeningacross the country. I can't afford to see Congress play the usualpolitical games. What we have to do right now is deliver for theAmerican people. So my bottom line when it comes to the recoverypackage is send me a bill that creates or saves 4 million jobs, becauseeverybody has to be possessed with a sense of urgency about putting peopleback to work, making sure that folks are staying in their homes, thatthey can send their kids tocollege. That doesn't negate the continuing effortsthat I'm going to make to listen and engage with my Republican colleagues. Andhopefully the tone that I've taken, which has been consistently civiland respectful, will pay some dividends over the longterm. There are going to be areas where wedisagree and there are going to be areas where we agree. As I said, the one concern I've got on the stimulus package, in terms of the debate and listening to some of what's been saidin Congress is that there seems to be a set of folks who -- I don'tdoubt their sincerity -- who just believe that we should donothing. Now, if that's their opening position or their closing positionin negotiations, then we're probably not going to make muchprogress, because I don't think that's economically sound and I don't thinkwhat -- that's what the American people expect, is for us to stand byand donothing. There are others who recognize that we'vegot to do a significant recovery package but they're concerned about the mix of what'sin there. And if they're sincere about it, then I'm happy tohave conversations about this tax cut versus that -- that tax cut orthis infrastructure project versus that infrastructureproject. But what I -- what I've been concernedabout is some ofthe language that's been used suggesting that this is full of porkand this is wasteful government spending, so on and so forth. First of all, when I hear that from folks who presided over a doubling ofthe national debt, then, you know, I just want them to not engage insome revisionist history. I inherited the deficit that we haveright now and the economic crisis that we have rightnow. Number two is that, although there aresome programs in there that I think are good policy, some of them aren't jobcreators. I think it's perfectly legitimate to say that those programs shouldbe out of this particular recovery package, and we can deal withthem later. But when they start characterizing this as porkwithout acknowledging that there are no earmarks in this package --something, again, that was pretty rare over the last eight years -- then youget a feeling that maybe we're playing politics instead of actuallytrying to solve problems for the Americanpeople. So I'm going to keep on engaging. Ihope that as we get the Senate and the House bills together, that everybody is willing togive a little bit. I suspect that the package that emerges is notgoing to be a hundred percent of what I want. But my bottom line is,arewe creating 4 million jobs, and are we laying the foundation forlong- term economicgrowth? This is another concern that I've had insome of the arguments that I'm hearing. When people suggest that what a waste ofmoney to make federal buildings more energy-efficient -- why would that bea waste of money? We're creating jobs immediately byretrofitting these buildings or weatherizing 2 million Americans' homes, as was called for in the package. So that right there creates economicstimulus, and we are saving taxpayers, when it comes to federalbuildings, potentially $2 billion. In the case of homeowners, they willsee more money in their pockets. And we're reducing our dependence onforeign oil in the Middle East. Why wouldn't we want to make thatkind of investment? Now, maybe philosophically you just don't think that the federal government should be involved in energy policy. I happen todisagree with that. I think that's the reason why we find ourselvesimporting more foreign oil right now than we did back in the early '70s,when OPEC first formed. And we can have a respectful debate aboutwhether or not we should be involved in energy policymaking, but don'tsuggest that somehow that's wasteful spending. That's exactly whatthis countryneeds. The same applies when it comes toinformation technologies and health care. We know that health care is crippling businessesand making us less competitive, as well as breaking the banks offamilies all across America. And part of the reason is we've got themost inefficient health care system imaginable. We're still usingpaper. We're -- we're still filing things in triplicate. Nursescan't read the prescriptions that doctors -- that doctors have writtenout. Why wouldn't we want to put that on an -- put that on anelectronic medical record that will reduce error rates, reduce our long-termcost of health care, and create jobs rightnow? Education, yet another example. Thesuggestion is, why should the federal government be involved in school construction? Well, I visited a school down in South Carolina that was built in the1850s. Kids are still learning in that school -- as best they can. When the -- when the railroad -- when the -- it's right next to a railroad,and when the train runs by the whole building shakes and the teacherhas to stop teaching for a while. The -- the auditorium iscompletely broken down and they can't use it. So why wouldn't we want to build state-of-the-art schools with science labs that are teaching our kids the skills they need forthe 21st century, that will enhance our economy and, by the way, rightnow will createjobs? So, you know, we can differ on some of theparticulars,but again, the question I think that the American people are asking is,do you just want government to do nothing, or do you want it todo something? If you want it to do something, then we can havea conversation. But doing nothing -- that's not an option frommy perspective. All right. Chuck Todd. Where'sChuck? QUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President. In your opening remarks,you talked about that if your plan works the way you want it to work,it's going to increase consumer spending. But isn't consumerspending, or over-spending, how we got into this mess? And if people getmoney back into their pockets, do you not want them saving it or payingdown debt first, before they start spending money into theeconomy? MR. OBAMA: Well, first of all,I don't think it's accurate to say that consumer spending got us into this mess. What gotus into this mess initially were banks taking exorbitant, wild riskswith other people's monies, based on shaky assets. And because ofthe enormous leverage, where they had $1 worth of assets and theywere betting $30 on that $1, what we had was a crisis in thefinancial system. That led to a contraction of credit, whichin turn meant businesses couldn't make payroll or make inventories, which meantthat everybody became uncertain about the future of the economy. So people started making decisions accordingly, reducing investments, initiating layoffs, which in turn made thingsworse. Now, you are making a legitimate point,Chuck, about the fact that our savings rate has declined. And this economy has beendriven by consumer spending for a very long time. And that's notgoing to be sustainable. You know, if all we're doing is spending andwe're not making things, then over time, other countries are going to gettired of lending us money. And eventually the party's going to beover. Well, in fact, the party now isover. And so the sequence of how we're approaching this is as follows. Our immediate job is tostop the downward spiral. And that means putting money intoconsumers' pockets. It means loosening up credit. It means putting forward investments thatnot only employ people immediately but also lay the groundwork for long-term economicgrowth. And that by the way is important, even if you're afiscal conservative, because the biggest problem we're going to have,with our federal budget, is if we continue a situation in which thereare no tax revenues, because economic growth is plummeting at thesame time as we've got more demands for unemployment insurance; we'vegot more demands for people who've lost their health care, more demandfor food stamps. That will put enormous strains on the federal budget as well as the state budget. So the most important thing we can do forour budget crisisright now is to make sure that the economy doesn't continue totank. And that's why passing the Economic Recovery Plan is the right thingto do, even though I recognize that it's expensive. Look, I would love not to have to spendmoney right now. I'd -- you know, this notion that somehow I came in here just ginned upto spend $800 billion, you know, that -- that wasn't -- that wasn'thow I envisioned my presidency beginning. But we have to adapt toexisting circumstances. Now, what we are going to also have to dois to make sure that as soon as the economy stabilizes, investment begins again; we'reno longer contracting, but we're growing; that our midterm andlong-term budget is dealt with. And I think the same is true forindividual consumers. Right now, they're just -- they're just trying tofigure out how do I make sure that if I lose my job, you know, I'm still going to be able to make my mortgage payments.

Once the economy stabilizes and people areless fearful, then I do think that we're going to have to start thinking about how dowe operate more prudently, because there's no such thing as a freelunch. So if -- if you want to get -- if you want to buy a house,then putting zero down and buying a house that is probably notaffordable for you in case something goes wrong, that's something that has tobe reconsidered. So we're going to have to change our --our bad habits. But right now, the key is making sure that we pull ourselves out ofthe economic slump that we'rein. All right. Julianna Goldman,Bloomberg. QUESTION Thank you, Mr.President. Many experts, from Nouriel Roubini toSenator Schumer, have said that it will cost the government more than a trillion dollars to really fix the financial system. During the campaign, youpromised the American people that you won't just tell them what they wantto hear, but what they need to hear. Won't the government needfar more than the $350 billion that's remaining in the financial rescue fundto really solve the credit crisis? MR. OBAMA: Well, the credit crisis is real. And it'snot over. I mean, we averted catastrophe by passing the TARPlegislation. But as I said before, because of a lack of clarity and consistencyin how it was applied, a lack of oversight in -- in -- in how themoney went out, we didn't get as a big of a bang for the buck as weshould have. My immediate task is making sure that thesecond half ofthat money, $350 billion, is spent properly. That's my firstjob. Before I even think about what else I've got to do, my first task is tomake sure that my secretary of the Treasury, Tim Geithner, workingwith Larry Summers, my national economic adviser, and others, are comingup with the best possible plan to use this money wisely, in a waythat's transparent, in a way that provides clear oversight; that weare conditioning any money that we give to banks on themreducing executive compensation to reasonable levels and to make surethat they're not wasting thatmoney. We are going to have to work with the banks in an effective way to clean up their balance sheets so that some trust is restoredwithin the marketplace, because right now part of the problem is thatnobody really knows what's on the banks' books. Any given bank,they're not sure what kinds of losses are there. We've got to open thingsup and restore sometrust. We also have to deal with the housingissue in a clearand consistentway. I don't want to preempt my secretary ofthe Treasury; he's going to be laying out these principles in great detail tomorrow. But my instruction to him has been let's get this right, let's createa template in which we're restoring market confidence. And thereason that's so important is because we don't know yet whether we'regoing to need additional money or how much additional money we'll needuntil we've seen how successful we are at restoring a sense of confidencein a marketplace that the federal government and the Federal ReserveBank and the FDIC, working in concert, know what they're doing. That can make a big difference, in terms of whether or not we attract private capital back into the marketplace. Andultimately the government cannot substitute for all the private capital that hasbeen withdrawn from the system. We've got to restore confidence,so that private capital goes backin. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President. My question followsJulianna's incontent. The American people have seen hundreds ofbillions ofdollars spent already. And still the economy continues tofree-fall. QUESTION: -- how canthe American people gauge whether or notyour programs areworking? Can they -- should they be looking at themetric of the stock market, home foreclosures, unemployment? What metric shouldthey use? When? And how will they know if it's working or whether ornot we need to go to a Plan B? MR. OBAMA: I think my initialmeasure of success is creating or saving 4 million jobs. That's bottom line numberone, because if people are working, then they've got enough confidenceto make purchases, to make investments. Businesses start seeingthat consumers are out there with a little more confidence. Andthey start making investments, which means they start hiring workers. So step number one, jobcreation. Step number two, are we seeing the creditmarketsoperate effectively? You know, I can't tell you how many businessesthat I talk to that are successful businesses but just can't getcredit. Part of the problem in Elkhart that I heard about today was thefact that this is the RV capital of America. You've got a bunch ofRV companies that have customers who want to purchase RVs, buteven though their credit is good, they can't get theloan. Now, the businesses also can't get loansto make payments to their suppliers. But when they have consumers, consumerscan't get the loans that they need. So normalizing the credit marketsis, I think, step number two. Step number three is going to behousing. Have we stabilized the housing market? Now, you know, the federal government doesn'thave complete control over that. But if our plan is effective,working with the Federal Reserve Bank, working with the FDIC, I think whatwe can do is stem the rate of foreclosure and we can startstabilizing housing values over time. And the most -- the biggest measure of success is whether we stop contracting and shedding jobs, and we start growing again. Now, you know, I don't have a crystal ball, and as I said, this isan unprecedented crisis. But my hope is that after a difficultyear -- and this year is going to be a difficult year -- that businessesstart investing again, they start making decisions that, you know, infact, there's money to be made out there; customers -- or consumersstart feeling that their jobs are stable and safe, and they startmaking purchases again. And if we get things right then, startingnext year, we can start seeing some significantimprovement. Ed Henry. Where's Ed? CNN. There heis. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President. You've promised to sendmore troops to Afghanistan. And since you've been very clear abouta time table to withdraw our combat troops from Iraq within 16 months,I wonder what's your time table to withdraw troops eventuallyfrom Afghanistan? And related to that, there's a Pentagonpolicy that bans media coverage of the flag-draped coffins from coming into Dover AirForce Base. And back in 2004, then-Senator Joe Biden said that itwas shameful for dead soldiers to be, quote, snuck back into thecountry under the cover ofnight. You've promised unprecedentedtransparency, openness in your government. Will you overturn that policy, so the Americanpeople can see the full human cost of war? MR. OBAMA: Your question is timely. We got reportsthat four American service members have been killed in Iraq today. And you know, obviously our thoughts and prayers go out to thefamilies. I've said before that, you know, peoplehave asked me, ""When did it hit you that you are now president?"" And what I toldthem was the most sobering moment is signing letters to the families of ourfallen heroes. It reminds you of the responsibilities that you carryin this office and the consequences of decisions that youmake. Now with respect to the policy of openingup media to loved ones being brought back home, we are in the process of reviewingthose policies in conversations with the Department of Defense. SoI don't want to give you an answer now, before I've evaluated that reviewand understand all the implicationsinvolved. With respect to Afghanistan, this is goingto be a big challenge. I think, because of the extraordinary work done by our troops andsome very good diplomatic work done by Ambassador Crocker in Iraq, wejust saw an election in Iraq that went relatively peacefully, and youget a sense that the political system is now functioning in ameaningful way. You do not see that yet in Afghanistan. They've got elections coming up, but effectively the national government seems verydetached from what's going on in the surrounding community. Inaddition, you've got the Taliban and al Qaeda operating in the FATA andthese border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. And what wehaven't seen is the kind of concerted effort to root out those safehavens that would ultimately make our missionsuccessful. So we are undergoing a thorough-goingreview. Not only is General Petraeus, now the head of CENTCOM, conducting his ownreview, he's now working in concert with the special envoy that I've sentover -- Richard Holbrooke, one of our top diplomats -- to evaluatea regional approach. We are going to need more effectivecoordination of our military efforts with diplomatic efforts withdevelopment efforts with more effective coordination with our allies in orderfor us to be successful. The bottom line, though -- and I just want to rememberthe American people, because this is going to be difficult -- is thisis a situation in which a region served as the base to launch anattack that killed 3,000 Americans. And this past week I met withfamilies of those who were lost in 9/11, a reminder of the costs ofallowing those safe havens toexist. My bottom line is that we cannot allow alQaeda to operate. We cannot have those safe havens in that region. And we're goingto have to work both smartly and effectively, but with consistency, inorder to make sure that those safe havens don'texist. I do not have yet a timetable for how longthat's going to take. What I know is I'm not going to make -- I'm not going to allowal Qaeda or bin Laden to operate with impunity planning attacks onthe U.S. homeland. All right. Helene Cooper. Where is Helene? Here yougo. QUESTION: Thank you,sir. I wanted to ask you, on the next bankbailout, are you going to impose a requirement that the financial institutions use this moneyto loosen up credit and make new lending? And if not, how do youmake the case to the American people that this bailout will work whenthe last one didn't? MR. OBAMA: Again, Helene, I --I -- and I'm trying to avoid preempting my secretary of the Treasury; I want all of youto show up at his press conference as well. (Laughter.) He's going to beterrific. But this relates to Jake's earlierquestion. One of my bottom lines is whether or not credit is flowing to the people who needit. Is it flowing to banks? Is -- excuse me; is it flowing tobusinesses, large and small? Is it flowing to consumers? Are theyable to operate in ways that translate into jobs and economic growth onMain Street? And the package that we've put together isdesigned to help do that. And beyond that, I'm going to make sure that Tim getshis moment in the sun tomorrow, allright? Major Garrett. Where isMajor? QUESTION: Mr. President,at a speech Friday that many of us covered, Vice President Biden said the following thing about a conversationthe two of you had in the Oval Office about a subject he didn'tdisclose. ""If we do everything right, if we do it with absolutecertainty, if we stand up there and we really make the tough decisions, there'sstill a 30 percent chance we're going to get it wrong."" Since the vice president brought it up,can you tell the American people, sir, what you were talking about? And if not, can you at least reassure them it wasn't the stimulusbill or the bank rescue plan and if in general you agree with that ratioof success, 30 percent failure, 70 percent success? MR. OBAMA: (Laughs.) Youknow, I don't remember exactly what Joe was referring to, not surprisingly. (Laughter.) But let me try thisout. I think what Joe may have been suggesting,although I wouldn't put numerical -- I would ascribe any numerical percentage to anyof this, is that given the magnitude of the challenges that we have,any single thing that we do is going to be part of the solution, notall of thesolution. And as I said in my introductory remarks,not everything we do is going to work out exactly as we intended it to work out. Thisis an unprecedented problem. And you know, when you talk toeconomists, there's some general sense of how we're going to move forward. There's some strong consensus about the need for a recovery package of a certain magnitude. There's a strong consensus that youshouldn't put all your eggs in one basket, all tax cuts or all investment,but that there should be a range ofapproaches. But even if we do everything right onthat, we've still got to deal with what we just talked about, the financial system andmaking sure that banks are lending again. We're still going to haveto deal with housing. We're still going to have to make sure thatwe've got a regulatory structure -- a regulatory architecture for thefinancial system that prevents crises like this from occurring again. Those are all big, complicated tasks. So I don't know whether Joe was referringto that, but I use that as a launching point to make a general point about theseissues. MR. OBAMA: I have noidea. I reallydon't. Michael Fletcher, The WashingtonPost. QUESTION: Yeah, thank you,sir. What's you're reaction to Alex Rodriguez's admission that he used steroids as a member of theTexas Rangers? MR. OBAMA: Yeah, I think it'sdepressing news on top of what's been a flurry of depressing items, when it comes to Major League Baseball. And if you're a fan of Major League Baseball, I think it -- it tarnishes an entire era, to some degree. And it's unfortunate, because I think there are a lot of ballplayers who played it straight. And you know, the thing I'm probably most concerned about the message that it sends to our kids. What I'm pleased about is, Major League Baseball seems to finally be taking this seriously, to recognize how big of a problem this is for the sport, and that our kids hopefully are watching and saying: You know what? There are no shortcuts; that when you try to take shortcuts, you may end up tarnishing your entire career, and that your integrity's not worth it. That's the message I hope is communicated. All right. Helen. This is my inaugural moment here. (Laughter.) I'm really excited. QUESTION: Mr. President, do you think that Pakistan and -- are maintaining the safe havens in Afghanistan for these so-called terrorists? And also, do you know of any country in the Middle East that has nuclear weapons? MR. OBAMA: Well, I think that Pakistan -- there is no doubt that in the FATA region of Pakistan, in the mountainous regions along the border of Afghanistan, that there are safe havens where terrorists are operating. And one of the goals of Ambassador Holbrooke as he is traveling throughout the region is to deliver a message to Pakistan that they are endangered as much as we are by the continuation of those operations, and that we've got to work in a regional fashion to root out those safe havens. They're -- it's not acceptable for Pakistan or for us to have folks who, with impunity, will kill innocent men, women and children. And you know, I -- I believe that the new government of Pakistan and -- and Mr. Zardari cares deeply about getting control of this situation, and we want to be effective partners with them on that issue. QUESTION: Did you get any promise from them? MR. OBAMA: Well, Mr. Holbrooke is there, and that's exactly why he's being sent there, because I think that we have to make sure that Pakistan is a stalwart ally with us in battling this terrorist threat. With respect to nuclear weapons, you know, I don't want to speculate. What I know is this: that if we see a nuclear arms race in a region as volatile as the Middle East, everybody will be in danger. And one of my goals is to prevent nuclear proliferation generally. I think that it's important for the United States, in concert with Russia, to lead the way on this. MR. OBAMA: -- so that we then have the standing to go to other countries and start stitching back together the non- proliferation treaties that frankly have been weakened over the last several years. Sam Stein, Huffington Post. Where's Sam? QUESTION: Right here. MR. OBAMA: There. Go ahead. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Today, Senator Patrick Leahy announced that he wants to set up a truth and reconciliation committee to investigate the misdeeds of the Bush administration. He said that before you turn the page, you have to read -- read the page first. Do you agree with such a proposal? And are you willing to rule out right here and now any prosecution of Bush administration officials? MR. OBAMA: I haven't seen the proposal, so I don't want to express an opinion on something that I haven't seen. What I have said is that my administration is going to operate in a way that leaves no doubt that we do not torture, that we abide by the Geneva Conventions, and that we observe our traditions of rule of law and due process as we are vigorously going after terrorists that can do us harm. And I don't think those are contradictory; I think they are potentially complementary. My view is also that nobody's above the law, and if there are clear instances of wrongdoing, that people should be prosecuted just like any ordinary citizen. But that generally speaking, I'm more interested in looking forward than I am in looking backwards. I want to pull everybody together, including, by the way, the -- all the members of the intelligence community who have done things the right way and have been working hard to protect America, and I think sometimes are painted with a broad brush, without adequate information. So I will take a look at Senator Leahy's proposal, but my general orientation is to say let's get it right moving forward. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. If it's this hard to get more than a handful of Republican votes on what is relatively easy -- spending tons of money and cutting people's taxes -- when you look down the road at health care and entitlement reform and energy reform, those are really tough choices. You're going to be asking some people to get less, and some people to pay more. What do you think you're going to have to do to get more bipartisanship? Are you going to need a new legislative model, bringing in Republicans from the very beginning, getting more involved in the details yourself from the beginning, or using bipartisan commissions? What has this experience with the stimulus led you to think about when you think about these future challenges? MR. OBAMA: Well, as I said before, Mara, I think that old habits are hard to break. And we're coming off of an election and I think people want to sort of test the limits of what they can get. You know, there's a lot of jockeying in this town and a lot of who's up and who's down and positioning for the next election. And what I've tried to suggest is that this is one of those times where we've got to put that kind of behavior aside, because the American people can't afford it. The people in Elkhart can't afford it. The single mom who's trying to figure out how to keep her house can't afford it. And whether we're Democrats or Republicans, surely there's got to be some capacity for us to work together -- not agree on everything, but at least set aside small differences to get things done. Now, just in terms of the historic record here, the Republicans were brought in early and were consulted. And you'll remember that when we initially introduced our framework, they were pleasantly surprised and complimentary about the tax cuts that were presented in that framework. Those tax cuts are still in there. I mean, I suppose what I could have done is started off with no tax cuts, knowing that I was going to want some, and then let them take credit for all of them. And maybe that's the lesson I learned. But there was consultation. There will continue to be consultation. One thing that I think is important is to recognize that because all these -- all these items that you listed are hard, that people have to break out of some of the ideological rigidity and gridlock that we've been carrying around for too long. And let me give you a prime example. When it comes to how we approach the issue of fiscal responsibility, again, it's a little hard for me to take criticism from folks, about this recovery package, after they presided over a doubling of the national debt. I'm not sure they have a lot of credibility when it comes to fiscal responsibility. Having said that, I think there are a lot of Republicans who are sincere in recognizing that unless we deal with entitlements in a serious way, the problems we have, with this year's deficit and next year's deficit, pale in comparison to what we're going to be seeing 10 or 15 years or 20 years down the road. Both Democrats and Republicans are going to have to think differently in order to come together and solve that problem. I think there are areas like education, where some in my party have been too resistant to reform, and have argued only money makes a difference. And there have been others on the Republican side or the conservative side who said, no matter how much money you spend, nothing makes a difference, so let's just blow up the public school systems. And -- and I think that both sides are going to have to acknowledge we're going to need more money for new science labs, to pay teachers more effectively. But we're also going to need more reform, which means that we've got to train teachers more effectively; bad teachers need to be fired after being given the opportunity to train effectively; that we should experiment with things like charter schools that are innovating in the classroom; that we should have high standards. So my whole goal over the next four years is to make sure that whatever arguments are persuasive and backed up by evidence and facts and proof, that they can work, that we are pulling people together around that kind of pragmatic agenda. And I think that there was an opportunity to do this with this recovery package because, as I said, although there are some politicians who are arguing that we don't need a stimulus, there are very few economists who are making that argument. I mean, you've got economists who were advising John McCain, economists who were advisers to George Bush -- one and two -- all suggesting that we actually needed a serious recovery package. And so when I hear people just saying we don't need to do anything; this is a spending bill, not a stimulus bill, without acknowledging that by definition part of any stimulus package would include spending -- that's the point -- then what I get a sense of is that there is some ideological blockage there that needs to be cleared up. But I am the eternal optimist. I think that over time people respond to -- to civility and rational argument. I think that's what the people of Elkhart and people around America are looking for, and that's what I'm -- that's the kind of leadership I'm going to try to provide. QUESTION: One more, Mr. President. PRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you, guys."

He is going all in on must-win New York. Is he hearing Ted Cruz's footsteps?Plus, Ted Cruz speaking to CNN this hour on how he'll win the nomination. Why he is not getting support from his own Capitol Hill colleagues? That interview right here OUTFRONT.And the breaking news, Bernie Sanders moments ago addressing the ugly battle over whether Hillary Clinton is qualified to be president. Let's go OUTFRONT.Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, bracing for battles. Donald Trump today making it clear he is gearing up for what will be an ugly fight ahead. Naming longtime political operative Paul Manafort as his convention manager. He also unexpectedly cleared his schedule. Usually he is doing two or three states at a time. He has cancelled his events in California, cancelled his events in Colorado focusing all his time and energy on New York.Also today, New York's most prominent Republican, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani telling two New York newspapers he is voting for Donald Trump, but he is not calling it an endorsement. A bit strange there. Trump's top rival Ted Cruz meantime facing an uphill battle in New York, visiting a Matzah Bakery in Brooklyn today after waking up to a tabloid headline suggesting he leave town on a train that shall we say is not an actual subway line.Our Dana Bash sat down for one-on-one interview with Senator Cruz late today. You'll going to see that full interview in just a moment. I want to go though first to Sara Murray.And Sara, significant here, Donald Trump, you know, sort of originally had been, well, New York is my home state. I love it. But I'm going to be able to go out to California and other states and campaign. He has now canceled those appearances and is focusing all in on New York. How much should we read into that?SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Erin, I think in this case it is a significant and strategic change. What this tells though is the Trump campaign is sort of tabling this fly-around strategy that they have used until this point and they are going all in on New York. This is a state where 95 delegates are at stake. And as we're talking to members of Trump's campaign in New York, they made it clear that they want to win all of them. They want to be able to sweep the 95 delegates in New York. And Erin, that's a tough thing to do. It means you need to get over 50 percent. Not just statewide, but in this Congressional districts. It involves a lot of legwork.And I think that's why we're seeing the Trump campaign revamp their schedule. Now, it is worth noting they have not released what their new schedule will be. So, he didn't have any events today. It's not clear what it going to be on his schedule tomorrow. So far there is nothing. This is when he was going to be in California. And it also mean that they are making choices to skip things like the convention that going to be in Colorado this weekend where there are 37 delegates who are going to be selected. Right now Ted Cruz will be there. Donald Trump will not. So we'll see if this new strategy pace off for them -- Erin.BURNETT: All right. It's going to be very significant to see what that schedule is over the next few hours. Sara, thank you.Ted Cruz in the meantime intent on posing a challenge to Trump on Trump's home turf saying, he think he can do it in New York. Just moments ago, our chief political correspondent Dana Bash sat down with Ted Cruz right here in New York for a one-on-one interview. And here it is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Senator, thank you so much for sitting down with me.SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's great to be with you, Dana.BASH: I'm sure you've seen this. I'm glad you're laughing, because the New York daily news gave you a warm welcome. They actually gave you some helpful hints to take the f-train and the u-train.CRUZ: Very helpful.BASH: Very helpful. In all seriousness, you know, when you saw this, what did you make of this?CRUZ: I laughed out loud. Look, I have never been popular with left wing journalists or tabloids. And frankly, that's not my target audience. You know, I'll tell you the energy and support we're saying we just did a wonderful gathering here. I came to Brooklyn and baked some Matzah and just spoke with the Russian Jewish community and the Orthodox community and Hassidic-Jewish community and the energy and enthusiasm we had here today was tremendous. And yesterday, it's interesting.Apparently the liberal journalists didn't like me being there. But in the Bronx yesterday, I had the opportunity to sit down with pastors, sit down with Hispanic pastors, African-American pastors. It was actually an event that was hosted by a Democratic state senator, Senator Ruben Diaz. He is a Democrat. He is a pastor. He is an African-American Hispanic and he invited me there and we had a wonderful gathering of pastors agreeing that we need to stand for shared values. So the reporter may not be happy, but I'm much more focused on the citizens.BASH: But in all seriousness, the origin of this, which again I'm glad you're having fun with. Because it is a New York tabloid, is that you several months ago disparaged New York value. I was upstate with you earlier today. And I'm well aware and talking to voter there that in Upstate, they got what you were saying.CRUZ: Yes. Yes.BASH: That you're talking about liberals in New York City --CRUZ: Sure. Sure.BASH: -- and that conservatives in Upstate New York are quite different. But you understand how a sound bite is played and how your opponent is using it against you here. Any regrets in using that terminology now that you're asking for New York voters to vote for you?[19:05:11] CRUZ: Not remotely. Because everyone in New York and outside of New York knows exactly what I meant by that. And it is the liberal values of Democratic politicians who have been hammering the people of New York for decades. They've suffered under these liberal values. It's been politicians like Governor Andrew Cuomo, like Hillary Clinton, like Mayor Bill de Blasio. You know, Andrew Cuomo told New Yorkers, said if you're pro-life, if you believe in traditional marriage, if you believe in the Second Amendment, there is no place for you in the state of New York. It was striking yesterday when I was meeting with Senator Diaz, and a Democratic senator. He said my own governor said there is no place for me as a pastor. And someone who believes in life. I mean, that is a liberal intolerance, which the people of New York I think are tired of.BASH: You talked about the fact that you are coming to talk to me now. We're sitting in a Jewish community center, in an ultra-Orthodox part of New York. You just helped make Matzah with young children. I've interviewed you a lot of places around the country.CRUZ: Sure.BASH: This is not one I expected, to be honest with you. Do you feel like you have been successful as a, you know, a Christian from Texas reaching out to the Orthodox Jews in New York?CRUZ: Very much. We've got tremendous support in the Jewish community. Tremendous support especially in the Orthodox community. I've been privileged to speak at synagogues all over the country. And in particular, to focus on defending religious liberty, which has been a passion of mine my entire life. And focus on standing with Israel.BASH: Coming here in New York, even the fact that you're campaigning in the New York Republican primary, is this how you plan to rack up delegates here, find pockets of support, like you know, here in the Orthodox Jewish community or in Upstate New York?CRUZ: We are building a big tent, and we're unifying Republicans. You know, nationwide, there are about 65 to 70 percent of Republicans that get that Donald Trump is not the best candidate to go up against Hillary Clinton. That he loses and loses badly to Hillary. And what we're saying happening all over the country is those 65 to 70 percent of Republicans are uniting behind this campaign. We saw it powerfully in Wisconsin just a couple of days ago.BASH: Okay. So no question you did very well in Wisconsin. And you should be commended for that victory.CRUZ: Thank you.BASH: But do you concede that at this point your only realistic way to get the nomination is at the convention? Not your only mathematical way, but your only realistic way?CRUZ: Not remotely. Look, we have a clear path forward to get to 1, 237 delegates. It's difficult. We've got to win and we've got to win consistently. But I'll point out in the last three weeks, we have won in four states in a role. We won a landslide in Utah, nearly 70 percent of the vote, we've got all of the delegates.BASH: But now you're here in New York and you're in third place, even behind John Kasich. You've got Maryland coming up. You're in third place in the polls. You need 88 percent of the remaining delegates to win.CRUZ: Well, let's see what the voters safe. You know, I actually think the people of New York, particularly Upstate New York, have an awful lot in common with the people of Wisconsin. Very, very similar. And what we're seeing happening across the country, what I hope we'll see in New York is that Republicans will unite.BASH: How actively are you working to convince? A good operation. You understand how the game is played. How hard are you working to convince Trump delegates to come your way on any second ballot should it come to that?CRUZ: Listen, we are working to earn every vote we can, every place we. So we're competing in all 50 states. And we're competing number one to win a primary, to win a caucus, to earn those votes, to unify the party. Our focus is unity, bringing together conservatives, bringing together libertarians, bringing together moderate, bringing together everyone who doesn't want to see Donald Trump as the nominee and doesn't want to hand the general election to Hillary Clinton gift wrapped.BASH: What about those who do want to see Trump as the nominee?CRUZ: Well, you know, it's interesting. Donald has had a floor about 20, 25 percent he seems to get no matter what. As he said, you know, he may be right that he could go out on Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and that floor would say there. But he also has a ceiling. He has a ceiling of 35 to 40 percent that he has a very hard time breaking. The worst day for the entire Trump campaign was the day Marco Rubio suspended his campaign. Because what happened is, over 80 percent of Marco's supporters came us to. And it unified much of the remainder of the party behind our campaign.BASH: Sure, but I'm talking about looking forward to the convention when if there is a contested convention, as you well know, the delegates are bound to whomever they're supporting initially.CRUZ: Sure.BASH: Then after that in a second ballot, many of them are not bound. How hard are you working to woo the Trump delegates for the second ballot?CRUZ: We are doing everything we can.BASH: One of the things that could help you is if you had more support from your own Republican Senate colleagues. You do now have two endorsements. But given how much momentum you say you got out of Wisconsin, how much many of your colleagues really dislike Donald Trump and don't want him to be the nominee, why don't you have more support from Republican senators?[19:10:10] CRUZ: Well, you know, Dana, I recognize that folks in the media focus on Washington. You cover Capitol Hill.BASH: It's not just Washington. It's opinion leaders at the conventions.CRUZ: What I can tell you is the energy and support we're receiving from the grassroots is overwhelming. And let me give you one of the illustrations of the unity we're seeing. We started out with 17 Republican candidates in this field, an amazing, talented diverse field. Of those 17, five are now supporting our campaign. We've got support from Rick Perry, from Lindsey Graham, from Jeb Bush, from Scott Walker and from Carly Fiorina. When you throw in Mike Lee and Mark Levin, that is the full spectrum of the Republican Party, the full ideological spectrum. And what we are seeing, that's the unity it's going take to win the nomination. It's also the unity it's going to take to beat Hillary Clinton. And my focus is on beating Hillary Clinton and poll after poll after poll shows Donald losing badly to Hillary. And poll after poll after poll shows me beating Hillary.BASH: But to get the chance to beat Hillary Clinton, you know how works, you actually have to be the Republican nominee. One of the things that my colleague Manu Raju in the Senate has heard from several Republican senators is that they probably would think about backing you and telling all of their grassroots activists to back you if you would apologize for saying that your Republican Leader Mitch McConnell was a liar. Will you apologize?CRUZ: You know what, Dana? This is why people are so frustrated with Washington. It's the inside battles back and forth. This isn't a game. This isn't about Washington power brokers. This isn't a smoke- filled room. If we want to turn the country around, let me tell you who should apologize. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton should apologize to the American people.BASH: But you called Mitch McConnell a liar, not them.CRUZ: They should apologize to the American people for seven years of economic stagnation, for people seeing jobs going overseas, for wages stuck. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton should apologize to all the single moms who have been forced into part-time work because of Obama.BASH: No apology to Mitch McConnell? Because it could help you.CRUZ: Look, my focus is not on Washington. That ain't going to happen. And if Washington lobbyists want the see that happen, they can hold their breath a long, long time. My focus is on the American people and uniting Republicans behind a shared values and a shared vision. Now I will tell you this. I am happy to praise Mitch McConnell, praise him effusively for his stand, along with Chuck Grassley saying we are not going to hold hearings on a replacement for Antonin Scalia. Mitch McConnell is doing the right thing. Chuck Grassley is doing the right thing. And I'm proud to commend them. I've done so publicly many times. They're doing the right thing and saying that Justice Scalia's replacement should be made by the next president so that the American people have an opportunity to vote and express their views. But we need to be focusing on the American people, not politicians bickering in Washington.BASH: I know we're almost out of time. Just one quick moment that really struck me and a lot of people. At your victory rally in Wisconsin, a lot of your supporters were chanting for your wife Heidi. And she came up on the stage and you had a couple of embraces there seems to be a lot of layers of emotion there. What was going through your mind at that moment?CRUZ: Well, listen, this has been a pretty amazing couple of weeks in politics. I never envisioned that my opponent would attack my wife. That he would go after my wife and my family. And Heidi is a rock. I mean, she is strong and she has come through this unwavering. But it was when I recognized Heidi in our victory speech, the supporters there began chanting ""Heidi."" And it was a powerful moment, just to see so many people embracing her and saying thank you, thank you for putting yourself through this garbage, for enduring the garbage that my opponent has heaped upon her. And that was powerful. And it just -- it made me want to say thank you to her also.And it also made me think, and this is something I think a lot about, about the example Heidi gives to our girls. You know, Katherine and Caroline, they're five and seven. And they're saying number one, they see their mommy attacked by a bully. And insulted and lied about. But they also see that their mommy stands up with a smile and she isn't scared. She isn't intimidated. And they see the people rallying around their mommy. And I hope that becomes an example to little girls across the country, that there is nothing that a strong woman cannot do. And I said many times Heidi is my best friend, and she is.BASH: Senator, thank you.BASH: We appreciate your time. Thank you so much.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURNETT: All right. And OUTFRONT next, Ted Cruz doing everything he can to win over New York voters today, making Matzah in that Brooklyn bakery.Plus, breaking news, Bernie Sanders moments ago addressing his ugly fight with Hillary Clinton. Is he still saying she is not qualified to be president?[19:15:07] And a very angry Bill Clinton today confronting protesters.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FMR. PRES. BILL CLINTON (D), UNITED STATES: You are defending the people who killed the lives you say matter. Tell the truth.(END VIDEO CLIP)[19:19:04] BURNETT: Tonight Donald Trump hunkering down in New York. The Republican front-runner cancelling events in California, Colorado, focusing on his home state instead.Just moments ago Ted Cruz told our own Dana Bash that he thinks he will do well here in New York.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: I actually think the people of New York, particularly Upstate New York have an awful lot in common with the people of Wisconsin. Very, very similar.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURNETT: Wisconsin, of course, a state that Cruz just won. And he won it big.OUTFRONT now, our chief political correspondent Dana Bash, plus the Cruz campaign's New Jersey State Chairman Steve Lonegan and Trump supporter Congresswoman Renee Ellmers. OK. Good to have all of you with us.Dana, let me start with you. By the way, speaking of New York, amazing that you were able to get from where you were with Ted Cruz out in Brooklyn here.BASH: You have to be a Jersey driver.(LAUGHTER)OK. So let me start with you. Cruz is saying he can do really well in New York. You know, I mean, being very optimistic about that. Of course, you couple that with Donald Trump seeming to cancel his appearances in further states and put all his eggs in the New York basket. Do you think he really can do as well here as he did in Wisconsin if he is kind of leading in that implication?BASH: No, absolutely not. I mean, there is not a chance. And I don't think that even on their most optimistic moments they think that they can do that well. But what they are trying to do in the name of the game is to keep Donald Trump's delegate numbers down and gobble up as many delegates as they can for themselves. So that is why before I was in Brooklyn, I was in Albany, a suburb of Albany that is more of kind of the Cruz voter. Very conservative. At least the area in Upstate New York where he was. If you he can do well there, maybe get a few delegates in the Congressional district there, maybe a few elsewhere, that is, you know, perhaps a good day for a Ted Cruz in the state of New York.BURNETT: Right.BASH: But to be clear, right now he is third place in the polls. He is trailing John Kasich.BURNETT: And Steve, that's an -- he also keeps citing how he is doing so well in polls against Hillary. Look, in the past three polls, one of them is behind her by nine points. The other two is within the margin of error. So, it's hardly to brag that he is beating her.STEVE LONEGAN, NEW JERSEY CHAIRMAN, TED CRUZ CAMPAIGN: Well, we've come off with two amazing weeks. In Utah two weeks ago the senator won by over 60 percent of the vote. Nobody has done that in the primary yet today. Then we go into North Dakota where we took 18 out of 19 delegates. Now, Colorado --BURNETT: OK. But nobody actually voted in North Dakota.LONEGAN: But we're going to sweep all the Colorado delegates again. And then Wisconsin. Huge victory. So Trump has been losing, losing, losing. Of course he is going to be ahead this the polls in New York. Things haven't recalibrated after the Wisconsin win. I'm not predicting Senator Cruz will win New York --BURNETT: OK.LONEGAN: But he has a remarkable ability to out-perform expectations. We need to do well here. We don't have to do great to win here. It was thought Donald Trump completely. But you know, the Trump campaign is in total turmoil, Erin. I mean, there is a battle brewing within the campaign, there is no guidance, no leadership. They're shooting in all different directions. You don't mow what this candidate is going say next. One position in the morning, one position for lunch, one position after dinner and maybe another before he goes to bed on the same issue. So, this is an issue for their campaign.BURNETT: Renee, a lot to say here, you just heard Steve, total turmoil, that Trump is losing, losing, losing. REP. RENEE ELLMERS (R), DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTER: No, I don't see thatat all. In fact I think what they're doing is working together in a very meaningful way. Thing is strategy from here on out. I think they're making a good move staying in New York. They are doing what they need to do to get the votes.LONEGAN: Erin, I need to say something. And with all due respect to Congressman Ellmers, and I like her very, very much. On the most important issues in Donald Trump's campaign, number one, he is going to deport all these illegal aliens. Illegal aliens. He is going to build this wall. Yet Congresswoman Ellmers has a very strong public position. She wants to give green cards to every illegal alien. In fact, Congressman Ellmers voted against Ron DeSantis (ph) bill to prioritize deporting the illegal alien child molesters in this country. She is the only Republican in the country to vote against it. She also is an opener supporter of TPA, which Donald Trump said he is going to overturn. Now, look, on the key issues his own supporters don't agree with him. That's pretty telling about the whole campaign.BURNETT: Congresswoman?ELLMERS: Well, let's talk about where Ted Cruz is on this issue. You know, last January -- January of 2015, we could have passed a very significant border security bill. But it was members of the Senate and members of the House like Ted Cruz that really put themselves in the way of it and our leadership ended up pulling the bill. There is much that needs to be done on immigration. And I may not always agree on every issue that Donald Trump has, but at least he wants to get something done. That's a lot more I can say that from Ted Cruz. You know, Donald Trump had the success rate that Ted Cruz has of voting no and accomplishing nothing in the Senate, he would not be the man that he is today running for president. And I believe that Donald Trump is going to be our next president because he has a record of success. And Ted Cruz, I'm sorry, does not.LONEGAN: Senator Ted Cruz led the effort to start the Marco Rubio- Chuck Schumer gang of eight amnesty bill by the way. And because of him we don't have that dastardly bill. And by the way, again, Congresswoman Ellmers' vote is the only Republican in the whole country to vote against deporting illegal alien child molesters. This is majorly opposed to everything Donald Trump stands for.[19:24:06] ELLMERS: It is absolutely ridiculous for you to think in any way, any form. But see? This is what comes out of the Ted Cruz camp. The calling names, you know, all of these things. We just heard this great interview where Ted Cruz is talking about, you know, a level of civility and how we should be more sensitive. And here we have his staff basically saying different.LONEGAN: Congresswoman, don't take it different. I respect you when you vote. Your votes are what they are. And I respect those votes. That's what you believe in. But they're diametrically opposed to everything Donald Trump stands for. And that's pretty telling.ELLMERS: No, absolutely not. Because actually what I am for is actually coming to the table in working out the issues. And that's a lot more than I can say for even us as Republicans in Congress. You know, there is a lot of frustration out there in this country. And it's basically in large because of President Obama and his administration. But I have got to say that there's responsibility we have to take as Republicans. And unfortunately, Ted Cruz has been one of those that has led us down a path to mislead the American people.LONEGAN: Look, Congresswoman --BURNETT: Let me ask you. Let me ask Dana a question though. Because you see Congresswoman Ellmers, you know, supporting Donald Trump. And one thing Steve, I know you've been behind Ted Cruz for a while. But Dana, his former colleagues are his colleagues now but other colleagues on Capitol Hill, they still are not rushing to support Ted Cruz.LONEGAN: Oh, I beg to differ.BURNETT: What is though?BASH: Well, you beg to differ because there are some notable exceptions.BURNETT: There are some notable exceptions --(CROSSTALK)BASH: Like Lindsey Graham and he says constantly and he is right that five of his former opponents now support him.BURNETT: Right.BASH: But -- but --LONEGAN: Huge.BASH: But he has -- 40 something, almost 50 -- actually, no, more than 50 Republican colleagues, his fellow Republican senators who have not endorsed him. And I think that that was a telling moment in that interview. Not just because of the fact that they haven't supported him, but because many of them are still miffed that he called their leader a liar from the Senate floor. And the fact that I pressed him to apologize, and he said ain't going to happen. Ain't going to happen.LONEGAN: This is the anti-establishment, anti-Washington. He is a consummate outsider.BASH: He wants the establishment to rally behind him but beat Donald Trump. You can't have it both ways, right?LONEGAN: The establishment is rallying behind the best candidate who is prepared to be the next president of the United States, one who can articulate his issues very clearly, very eloquently, and with force as opposed to a guy who -- whose own supporters don't know what he stands for. BURNETT: I hit pause there. You know, Lindsey Graham by the waysaying he is backing Ted Cruz because the other 15 people he wanted to back are no longer running. But we're going to be talking with Congressman Peter King who says, he would never vote for Ted Cruz later on on this hour, found out whether he would vote for Cruz or Trump when push comes to shove. Now, that interview later on this hour.And next, the breaking news, Bernie Sanders speaking moments ago on whether Hillary Clinton is qualified to be president. And Bill Clinton clashing with protesters in Philadelphia today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I don't know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out on to street to murder other African-American children. Maybe you thought they were good citizens.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[19:31:08] ERIN BURNETT, CNN ANCHOR: Breaking news: Bernie Sanders not backing down from his accusation that Clinton is unqualified for the presidency, but tonight admits to CBS News he may have gone too far.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You're right. We should not get into this tit for tat. We should be debating the issues facing the American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURNETT: Jeff Zeleny is OUTFRONT.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I will take Bernie Sanders over Donald Trump or Ted Cruz any time.JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Hillary Clinton taking the high road today. For a moment, at least, as the Democratic race devolves into a war of words.CLINTON: Let's keep our eye on what is really at stake in this election.ZELENY: At stake is the New York primary, which Bernie Sanders is fighting hard to win, firing off some of the most personal attacks yet of the campaign over who is qualified to be president.SANDERS: The American people might wonder about your qualifications, Madam Secretary, when you voted for the war in Iraq. ZELENY: In Philadelphia today, Sanders unleashed a laundry list ofgrievances.SANDERS: Are you qualified to be president of the United States when you're raising millions of dollars from Wall Street, an entity whose greed, recklessness and illegal behavior helped destroy our economy?ZELENY: Sanders said Clinton started by diminishing his qualifications. She said he did.It's a rough and tumble New York primary, raising questions about unifying the Democratic Party.SANDERS: I ran a very contested campaign against then-Senator Obama, and it went all the way to the end. We worked really hard. He got more delegates. And so I endorsed him.ZELENY: This map on the wall at Clinton campaign headquarters in Brooklyn is a daily reminder of their lead in delegates.Sanders is vowing to take the fight to the convention, a move that doesn't sit well with Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook.ROBBY MOOK, HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGER: The stakes are so high. Nobody wants -- nobody in our party wants to see Donald Trump or Ted Cruz become president. I think people will very quickly unify behind our nominee.ZELENY (on camera): But it is different. I mean, she was a Democrat her entire life, and he's not been a Democrat. What incentive does he have to help unify this party?MOOK: Well, that's up to Senator Sanders. He is going to have to make a decision about the role he wants to play.ZELENY: Would it be a mistake for the party to keep litigating this into July into Philadelphia?MOOK: Well, I think at the point it's obvious a candidate has a majority of delegates and will win the nomination at the convention. I do think it will be time to come together. But we're not there yet.(END VIDEOTAPE)ZELENY: So, Erin, after a very aggressive day on the campaign trail, back and forth, this war of words, things are calming down at least a little bit. Bernie Sanders just a short time ago told CBS News that he should not be engaging in a tit for tat. He should be focusing on the issues of importance to the American people.So, both sides are sort of cooling their jets a bit tonight, Erin. But it all starts again tomorrow, another day on the campaign trail here in New York. We'll see how this unity goes with 12 days left before that New York primary.BURNETT: All right. Jeff, thank you very much. And, of course, you know, saying he doesn't want to engage in tit for tat is not the same thing as saying I didn't mean it. I take it back.Joining me now, Bronx borough president, Ruben Diaz, Jr., who supports Hillary Clinton. In fact, he accompanied her on campaign stop in the Bronx this morning. And Nomiki Konst, Democratic strategist and Bernie Sanders supporter.So, Nomi, let me start with you. Senator Sanders now saying, OK, I want to focus on other things, not a tit for tat. But he is standing by what he is saying. He didn't take it back. He has now said twice that Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president.His campaign manager said she is not qualified because of her foreign policy. He is actually specifically saying it led to the rise of ISIS.Has the campaign gone too far?NOMIKI KONST, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Absolutely not. This has been a campaign about issues from day one. And if Hillary Clinton is fear that this is a campaign that has gone too far, she should be concerned if she is the nominee going up against Donald Trump who talks about hand sizes on stage.I mean, Bernie Sanders has a core set of values. He has talked about them every single moment he can. He is on message.Now, that's not personal. That means when he talks about her record, he is talk about her record, because voters need to know. They're not going to trust the person who is propagating this information out of their campaign to give them that information.[19:35:05] They need to see the difference between the two candidates.Now, Bernie Sanders talks about income inequality. He talks -- you know, one of the things that Hillary Clinton came out today is she attacked him on guns again, right? Well, nobody talks about how in 2000 Hillary Clinton didn't want universal background checks. Nobody talks about the fact that Hillary Clinton's gun record was so conservative in 2008 that Barack Obama called her Annie Oakley and she called him out of touch.Nobody discusses these things. They talk about one vote by Bernie Sanders.(CROSSTALK)BURNETT: Ruben?RUBEN DIAZ, JR., HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTER: The reality is that it was Bernie Sanders who said that he was going to keep this campaign clean, and he has gone against that promise. And what he says today and what he said yesterday about Hillary not being qualified is absolutely ridiculous. I mean, Nomi, (INAUDIBLE) no one who is a Bernie Sanders supporter cantruly believe that Hillary is not the best qualified candidate when she has been first lady. She has been there for us in New York as a U.S. senator. She's been there as a leader in terms of health care and immigration reform.And the reality is, is that Bernie Sanders is the one who has not voted and has a sketchy record when it comes to gun control.(CROSSTALK)But this issue of right now the conversation and who is qualified, right?KONST: Right.BURNETT: He specifically said he is unqualified. She has not used that word but she essentially said --(CROSSTALK)DIAZ: She never said that she was unqualified.BURNETT: Let me play the exchange on MSNBC of exactly what she said so people can hear for themselves. Here she is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I think the interview raised a lot of really serious questions. And I look at it this way. The core of this campaign has been break up the banks. And it didn't seem in reading his answers that he understood exactly how that would work under Dodd/Frank, exactly who would be responsible, what the criteria were. And, you know, that means you can't really help people if you don't know how to do what you are campaigning on saying you want to do.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURNETT: Ruben, she didn't use the word ""unqualified."" But isn't she making the same point?DIAZ: No. She is talking about the fact that Bernie Sanders, whether as a presidential candidate or as a U.S. senator for the last 20 years has been talking about regulating banks and dealing with Wall Street. And then when he is asked on an editorial board, how would you solve this?So, it's one thing to talk, talk, talk and make promises that you can't commit to or that you don't know how to solve the problem. And then when they ask you, how would you resolve this?Hillary Clinton for so many years has been someone who's identified the problem and who has come up with solutions. And the same way that people in the Bronx said they felt her, know her, understand that because we've come so long, it's because she has helped identify those solutions.Bernie Sanders should have had the response in the editorial board and that's what she was speaking to.KONST: That's actually not true. You know, this is a meeting that was 45 minutes long. It was so detailed so, much so that ""The New York Times"" came out with a fact check the next day saying that there were quotes taken out of context --BURNETT: This is ""The Daily News"" report that you're referring to.KONST: Exactly.BURNETT: That Bernie Sanders has been widely criticized for.KONST: Widely criticized for it, but the reality is most of the media, most of the people out there have not read it and don't understand economics policy. You know, he said that he has left to it the authority of legislators to legislate Dodd/Frank. You can't go into detail in legislation that hasn't been debated and hasn't been debated in 50 years.You know, she is the one who was against -- she was against Glass- Steagall. She was for repealing Glass-Steagall. And that's what led to the collapse of our economy.So, the record does not match the rhetoric for Hillary Clinton. That's the problem.DIAZ: She never said he is unqualified, that he is unqualified. He is dividing the Democratic party. We have to keep our eyes on the prize and make sure that we're united as a party and beat the Republican in November.KONST: One quick note of that. Brian Fallon was the one who issued the press release saying that we plan to disqualify him, defeat him and unite the party. So, they have started with that comment. It wasn't a press release to just their campaign, it was press release to the world.DIAZ: We look forward to winning and uniting the party.BURNETT: Like Clinton and Sanders, no one wants to give the other the last word. Thank you both.Clinton and Sanders will face off in New York a week from tonight right here on CNN.And next, GE CEO slamming Bernie Sanders, charging that he makes hollow campaign promises. But just moments ago, Sanders fires back. You're not going to believe what he just said.And Ted Cruz saying the Republican Party is uniting around his candidacy. Is it? I'll ask my next guest, a leading Republican who says he just can't stand that guy.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BURNETT: Breaking news: Bernie Sanders versus General Electric. Sanders just unleashing a sharp new attack on GE after the company's CEO Jeffrey Immelt released a scathing and frankly unprecedented op-ed today. The CEO of GE Jeff Immelt wrote this, ""It's easy to make hollow campaign promises and take cheap shots in speeches and during editorial board sessions. But American companies have to deliver for their employees, customers and shareholders ever day."" It continued.And in a statement that we have just obtained here at CNN, the Sanders campaign is firing back, upping the ante, saying that GE is slashing jobs, stashing profits overseas, tossing Americans out into the street and saying that the CEO Jeff Immelt needs to look no further than in the mirror if he wants to know what's wrong.The back and forth started when Sanders came out strong against GE during an interview with ""The Daily News"".(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)SANDERS: General Electric doing a very good job of avoiding taxes. In fact, in a given a year, they pay nothing in taxes. That's greed. That is greed and that's selfishness. That is lack of respect to people of this country.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURNETT: Joe Johns is with the Sanders campaign tonight. He is OUTFRONT in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Joe, it was an unprecedented op-ed. You now have what seems to be an unprecedented statement from the Sanders campaign. What are they now saying?JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: I think that's true, Erin. This is a statement from Warren Gunnels, policy director for the Sanders campaign.It says in part, ""If the CEO of General Electric wants to know how his company is destroying the fabric of America, he should take a good look in the mirror. He has a retirement package worth an estimated $58 million. Meanwhile, he is one of the leaders of a business group lobbying Congress to slash Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.""[19:45:03] So, this goes way back. They also sent me what was essentially a sound bite of Sanders on the Senate floor, all the way back in 2010 where he was railing against Immelt, GE and its tax avoidance policies among other things.So, clearly, Bernie Sanders is just keeping that team up tonight.BURNETT: I mean, it's not just a one line. It's as you say detailed. And it does, as you just read there, go after the CEO of General Electric, Jeff Immelt, personally, for his retirement package, saying he needs to look into the mirror. This is not just GE, though, in terms of Sanders. He has, of course,been going after the big banks, other major corporations. He has done so again and again, Joe.Given what, this back and forth, though, is this likely to help or hurt Bernie Sanders?JOHNS: I got to be honest with you, Erin. Going around the country, talking to people who support Bernie Sanders, a lot of people are attracted to him because of his anti-corporate, anti-big bang, anti- Wall Street stances.So, as far as a lot of voters, Bernie Sanders is concerned, they say he is doing exactly what he is doing and what he should be doing when he is standing up to corporate interests and CEOs like Jeffrey Immelt.BURNETT: All right. Thank you very much, Joe Johns.And OUTFRONT next, one prominent New York Republican said he would jump off a bridge before he would support Ted Cruz. So if it comes down to Cruz or Clinton, who will we vote for? He is my guest, next.And Jeanne Moos hanging out with New York subway riders today.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[19:50:33] BURNETT: Tonight, Ted Cruz under pressure fighting to beat Donald Trump in the crucial New York primary. Cruz also, though, under attack from some influential Republican congressmen.Peter King specifically is upset about his criticism of New York values. King says any New Yorker considering Cruz should have their head examined. Cruz, though, not backing down.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Everyone in New York and outside of New York knows exactly what I meant by that. And it is the liberal values of Democratic politicians who have been hammering the people of New York for decades. They suffered under these liberal values. It's been politicians like Governor Andrew Cuomo, like Hillary Clinton, like Mayor Bill de Blasio.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURNETT: OUTFRONT now, Republican congressman from New York, former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Peter King.Congressman, a pleasure to have you on. Let's get straight to it.You say you will never vote for Ted Cruz. Why not?REP. PETER KING (R), NEW YORK: I think he's a phony, he's a fraud. Since he's come to the Senate, his only achievement if you want to call it that, is being responsible for shutting down the Senate floor and going on the floor and reading Dr. Seuss and giving a speech about Dr. Seuss and God knows what else for 23 hours on the Senate floor. Since then, this whole remark about New York values.What he said shows how disingenuous that he was talking about liberal Democrats. He didn't say that. He said New York values.I've seen some of these guys like him. They play this regional game. They attack the North, they attack the Northeast, they attack New York. He knew what he was doing.When I think of New York values, I think of the cops and firefighters at 9/11. I think of the National Guard and reserve units in Iraq and Afghanistan. I think of Rudy Giuliani and Mike Bloomberg who turned this city around. That is New York.And also, by the way, we do have -- we have liberals, we have conservatives. New York state was also the home of the conservative party. We were one of the first states to elect a conservative senator, Jim Buckley. Ronald Reagan carried New York twice.So, it is a diverse state. It goes Democrat. It goes Republican. Conservative liberal. We can fight. We can stand together.But when the crunch time is there, New Yorkers rise to the occasion, and we have our values.BURNETT: So, Congressman, though, when you refer to Ted Cruz as a phony and a fraud. Look, you're not the only person who said nasty things about him who he's worked with. But some people who said those sorts of things have changed their minds. One of them, Lindsey Graham. Here he is then and now.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If you nominate Trump and Cruz, I think you get the same outcome. Whether it's death by being shot or poisoning, does it really matter?Ted and I have a lot of differences.(CROSSTALK)GRAHAM: What can I say? One, he's not completely crazy.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURNETT: Could you come around like Senator Graham? Could you ever vote for Ted Cruz if it's Cruz versus Clinton?KING: Cruz versus Clinton, I'd vote for the nominee in my party. That I will do.But in the primary, no, I never could. Listen, I'd have differences with Donald Trump but when you have someone like John Kasich, who's a solid person, Donald Trump who at least achieved something.Unlike Ted Cruz, again, the way he attacked New York, the smart attitude he has, I could not find myself ever voting for him in the Republican Party. If he's the nominee of the party, obviously, I'll vote for him. It's not a lot of enthusiasm, but I'll vote for him.BURNETT: All right. So, in the primary, you're saying you won't vote for Ted Cruz but you'd vote for him in the general election versus Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump, will you vote for Donald Trump on April 19th?KING: Right now, I haven't decided between Donald Trump and John Kasich. You know, I'd have differences with Donald Trump, specifically some of the allegations he's made against John McCain, President Bush, some of the positive things he said about Vladimir Putin, which I thought were just wrong. And John Kasich is a friend.But I really have not decided. But I do have issues with Donald Trump, and I think he has to resolve them.BURNETT: All right. Thank you very much, Congressman King. Pleasure to talk to you tonight.KING: Thank you, Erin.BURNETT: And OUTFRONT next, Jeanne Moos on why New Yorkers went crazy when Hillary took a swipe at the subway today.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[19:57:46] BURNETT: Hillary Clinton skipped a fancy car and driver, opting to commute the same way millions of New Yorkers do. Here's Jeanne Moos.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Imagine you're sitting in a subway car just want to be left alone on your way to work.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let's back up. Let's back up.CLINTON: How are you?CUOMO: Hey, she's just like us, riding the subway.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Next president of the United States. Say hello to the next president.CLINTON: Hillary went for a subway joy ride carried live.CAROL COSTELLO, CNN ANCHOR: I just want to explain what our viewers are looking at.MOOS: That's a dank, dark, New York City subway corridor. I mess up press hustled and squeezed to follow Hillary who played traffic cop.CLINTON: You've got to move a little bit, Dan, so I could get more people in. Some people need to get off?MOOS: Hillary rode two stops in the Bronx, got off and got kissed by a stranger. She posed for selfies. But it was the woman of the people photo op that the campaign was after.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Going to make this shot work for everyone.MOOS: Hillary's live ride ended up side by side with Ted Cruz getting slammed by ""The Daily News"" headline ""Take the FU train, Ted.""The new sanbagged Bernie Sanders with a token subway question. How do you get on the subway today? You get a token and get in. Wrong.Hillary knows tokens gave way to metro cards more than a decade ago. But uh-oh. When she tried to swipe her card, it didn't work once, twice, three times, four times. The fifth time was the charm.Conservative websites pounced on Hillary's struggle. Shocking new video, out of touch, Hillary Clinton.Out of touch? The touch is the problem. This happens all the time. Even to seasoned subway riders like myself.And Hillary, it could have been worse. A failed swipe can lead to a whack in the groin.Hillary laughed off her swiping snafu. The campaign maybe getting testy, but please no hitting below the belt.Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York.(END VIDEOTAPE)BURNETT: Thank you so much for joining us.""AC360"" starts right now."

Governor Abbott called the special session to address 20 conservative policy initiatives, including property tax reform, limits on state and local spending, and ending forced collection of union dues by local governments, most of which failed to pass the House during the regular session.During the month-long special session, the Texas Senate passed bills on all 20 of the Governor’s initiatives, while the Texas House only passed 11. The House failed to get many important bills out of committees and to the floor for a vote, indicating a lack of will among Republican leadership in the House to advance conservative priorities.Governor Abbott’s top political strategist, Dave Carney, said, “it’s pretty clear the culture of the House is corrupt, that it’s a non-transparent system, that doesn’t allow [its members] to have an up or down vote.”“It has become clear that leaders in the Texas House have lost contact with the core principles of the majority of Texans. Texans deserve better. It is time for a new force for change that will remove these barriers to progress,” said Don Dyer, NLP’s spokesman and PAC treasurer.NLP is the culmination of discussions among a growing movement of organizations, leaders, and voters across the state. Evidence of the need for NLP is illustrated by the passage of resolutions demanding changes in House leadership by 54 (and growing) of Republican party county chapters that together represent over 50 percent of Texas Republican voters.“Our growing list of contributors have been encouraged by the outpouring of support for NLP, and we are committed to find, promote and support a new crop of leaders in the House to ensure common-sense policies for all Texans,” said Dyer.NLP plans to encourage and support new leadership at all levels in the Texas House during the 2018 Primary season and beyond.© 2017 New Leadership PAC

These are hard-working Americans who want to make their cities and towns a better place and ensure that every American has a shot at the American Dream and the opportunity to live in a safe, prosperous community. To say anything otherwise is further proof that Mitt Romney is detached from the reality of Wisconsinites.But this comes as no surprise coming from a candidate who has joked about being unemployed himself, said he likes firing people and claimed that corporations are people. Obviously, Romney doesn’t get it.Mitt Romney saying we don’t benefit from more firefighters, police officers and teachers is further proof of his philosophy of Romney Economics: tax cuts for the wealthy over investments in our community — the same formula that benefitted a few, but crashed our economy and punished the middle class. In Massachusetts, firefighters were among the many victims of Romney Economics. As Romney made clear on Friday, he doesn’t care about these jobs — but as governor, he didn’t seem to care about their safety either, vetoing millions of dollars for fire-safety equipment and targeting that equipment with a line-item veto.From that earlier call, these remarks prepared for delivery:DNC Communications Director Brad WoodhouseThank you for joining the call today. As you know, last week Mitt Romney showed just how out of touch he is with middle-class Wisconsinites.In addition to joking that he is unemployed, that he thinks corporations are people too, and telling us that he likes firing people, in a moment of candor Mitt Romney said we don’t need more firefighters, policemen, and teachers. These types of statements and this type of sentiment is absolutely shocking.Listening to that, hardworking Americans have to wonder just how much more disconnected from the concerns of middle-class Americans could Mitt Romney be?These are hard-working folks who want to make their cities and towns a better place. To say anything otherwise is further proof that Mitt Romney is detached from the reality of hardworking Wisconsinites and the concerns of their everyday lives.President Obama knows that firefighters, policemen, and teachers are the backbone of a successful community and that they have been hit hard by the recession. On top of creating 4.3 million private sector jobs over the past 27 months, President Obama has given Congress a clear plan that would create as many as one million new jobs and put firefighters, policemen, and teachers back to work. But Republicans in Congress are doing nothing to pass that plan and is leaving a million jobs on the table.President Obama is the only one with a plan to move this country forward and strengthen our economy. Among the first things he did in office, President Obama saved more than 300,000 educators’ jobs and helped states prevent massive layoffs.And he’s making sure they have the resources they need to do their jobs. He supported projects to modernize our children’s schools and smart reforms that give schools and school districts the flexibility they need to best serve students.He also supported hiring programs, provided safety equipment and modernized firehouses and police stations that have helped thousands of police, firefighters and first responders keep their jobs and keep them safe.President Obama understands that when these folks work, it not only helps our children in the classroom and keep our streets safe, but it also gives them more money to spend in their communities at the local shop or corner store.President Obama is working hard to provide solutions. And what is Mitt Romney’s solution to strengthen the economy? Fire more people. Even Scott Walker in Wisconsin said that Mitt Romney learned the wrong lessons from Wisconsin in promising he will make cuts to these jobs.Mitt Romney saying that we don’t benefit from more firefighters, police officers, and teachers is further proof of his philosophy of Romney Economics: more budget-busting tax cuts for the wealthy and fewer rules for Wall Street—the same formula that benefitted a few, but crashed our economy and punished the middle class.And this is the same troubling formula that Mitt Romney put in place as governor of Massachusetts where he asked the middle class to continue to sacrifice more. Romney made drastic cuts in funding to education and first responders, and Massachusetts fell to 47th out of 50 in job creation. Middle class Americans can’t afford Romney Economics: tax cuts for the wealthy over investments in our community is not the formula for a successful community.He’s promising the same solutions now. Make no mistake, though, the American people and the people of Wisconsin are going to continue to see through Mitt Romney’s devastating economic plan. It didn’t work in Massachusetts, it won’t work in Wisconsin, and it won’t work for America.President of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin Mahlon MitchellThank you, Brad.I’m Mahlon Mitchell, the President of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin, which proudly represents thousands of professional firefighters across Wisconsin and this country.First responders and teachers were among the many victims of Romney Economics in Massachusetts. Romney has made it absolutely crystal clear — he doesn’t care about our jobs. And apparently, he doesn’t care about Wisconsinites safety, either.In his first year as governor of Massachusetts, Romney slashed investments in local aid, costing about 14,500 Massachusetts teachers, cops, librarians and others their jobs.Romney also vetoed millions of dollars for fire-safety equipment. And it wasn’t funding in all-encompassing bill that Romney vetoed. He specifically targeted this safety equipment by vetoing it with a line-item veto.Mitt Romney first cut funding for our coats, pants, helmets and boots – equipment that is essential to do the job and that protects firefighters when they run into a burning building.He went a step further when he cut funding for handheld lights that help firefighters see through the smoke, and the devices that help them communicate with other firefighters.This type of funding would’ve saved more lives by giving firefighters the tools they need to find the victims in a fire, and to track their fellow firefighters to make sure they make it out okay.Even personal-alert safety systems, air packs, tanks and compressors were on Romney’s chopping block. That’s the equipment that literally keeps firefighters alive and breathing while they’re surrounded by flames.Firefighters simply cannot do their jobs without that lifesaving equipment.Mitt Romney made it clear that equipment our first responders needed to keep themselves and our communities safe was not a priority to him. And these cuts were so contrary to the values of the Massachusetts people, that both parties in the State House and Senate overrode these vetoes unanimously.But that didn’t stop Romney Economics. Governor Romney even had the gall to put a stop to building a fire station that would have been a living memorial for six local firefighters who died in a warehouse fire. This would have been important to both the families and the community, but it wasn’t important enough to Mitt Romney.Regardless of what Mitt Romney might think, more cops and firefighters keep our streets safe and our communities protected. It’s a fact, and anyone who says otherwise is completely disconnected from reality.The truth is Romney simply didn’t advocate for the folks who would’ve risked their lives to save him if his house was on fire – and his comments on Friday prove that nothing’s changed.I don’t know a single person other than Mitt Romney who thinks we have too many teachers, too many police officers and too many firefighters in our communities.Our first responders look out for us in tough times, and it’s our turn to do the same for them. Mitt Romney just doesn’t understand that.

Key approaches for HIV prevention, which are often used in combination, are listed below.Male and female condom useCorrect and consistent use of male and female condoms during vaginal or anal penetration can protect against the spread of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Evidence shows that male latex condoms have an 85% or greater protective effect against HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).Testing and counselling for HIV and STIsTesting for HIV and other STIs is strongly advised for all people exposed to any of the risk factors. This way people learn of their own infection status and access necessary prevention and treatment services without delay. WHO also recommends offering testing for partners or couples. Additionally, WHO is recommending assisted partner notification approaches so that people with HIV receive support to inform their partners either on their own, or with the help of health care providers.Testing and counselling, linkages to tuberculosis careTuberculosis (TB) is the most common presenting illness and cause of death among people with HIV. It is fatal if undetected or untreated and is the leading cause of death among people with HIV, responsible for 1 of 3 HIV-associated deaths.Early detection of TB and prompt linkage to TB treatment and ART can prevent these deaths. TB screening should be offered routinely at HIV care services and routine HIV testing should be offered to all patients with presumptive and diagnosed TB. Individuals who are diagnosed with HIV and active TB should urgently start effective TB treatment (including for multidrug resistant TB) and ART. TB preventive therapy should be offered to all people with HIV who do not have active TB.Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC)Medical male circumcision, reduces the risk of heterosexually acquired HIV infection in men by approximately 60%. This is a key prevention intervention supported in 15 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) with high HIV prevalence and low male circumcision rates. VMMC is also regarded as a good approach to reach men and adolescent boys who do not often seek health care services. Since the 2007 WHO recommendation for VMMC as an additional prevention strategy, nearly 15 million adolescent boys and men in ESA were provided a package of services including HIV testing and education on safer sex and condom use.Antiretroviral drug use for preventionPrevention benefits of ARTA 2011 trial has confirmed that if an HIV-positive person adheres to an effective ART regimen, the risk of transmitting the virus to their uninfected sexual partner can be reduced by 96%. The WHO recommendation to initiate ART in all people living with HIV will contribute significantly to reducing HIV transmission.Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV-negative partnerOral PrEP of HIV is the daily use of ARV drugs by HIV-negative people to block the acquisition of HIV. More than 10 randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of PrEP in reducing HIV transmission among a range of populations including serodiscordant heterosexual couples (where one partner is infected and the other is not), men who have sex with men, transgender women, high-risk heterosexual couples, and people who inject drugs.WHO recommends PrEP as a prevention choice for people at substantial risk of HIV infection as part of a combination of prevention approaches. WHO has also expanded these recommendations to HIV-negative women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.Post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (PEP)Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is the use of ARV drugs within 72 hours of exposure to HIV in order to prevent infection. PEP includes counselling, first aid care, HIV testing, and administration of a 28-day course of ARV drugs with follow-up care. WHO recommends PEP use for both occupational and non-occupational exposures and for adults and children.Harm reduction for people who inject and use drugsPeople who inject drugs can take precautions against becoming infected with HIV by using sterile injecting equipment, including needles and syringes, for each injection and not sharing drug using equipment and drug solutions. Treatment of dependence, and in particular opioid substitution therapy for people dependent on opioids, also helps reduce the risk of HIV transmission and supports adherence to HIV treatment. A comprehensive package of interventions for HIV prevention and treatment includes:needle and syringe programmes;opioid substitution therapy for people dependent on opioids and other evidence-based drug dependence treatment;HIV testing and counselling;risk-reduction information and education and provision of naloxone;access to condoms; andmanagement of STIs, tuberculosis and viral hepatitis.Elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (EMTCT)The transmission of HIV from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, labour, delivery or breastfeeding is called vertical or mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). In the absence of any interventions during these stages, rates of HIV transmission from mother-to-child can be between 15–=45%. MTCT can be nearly fully prevented if both the mother and the baby are provided with ARV drugs as early as possible in pregnancy and during the period of breastfeeding.WHO recommends lifelong ART for all people living with HIV, regardless of their CD4 count clinical stage of disease, and this includes women who pregnant or breastfeeding. In 2016, 76% of the estimated 1.4 million pregnant women living with HIV globally received ARV treatments to prevent transmission to their children. A growing number of countries are achieving very low rates of MTCT and some (Armenia, Belarus, Cuba and Thailand) have been formally validated for elimination of MTCT of HIV as a public health problem. Several countries with a high burden of HIV infection are also progressing along the path to elimination.TreatmentHIV can be suppressed by combination ART consisting of 3 or more ARV drugs. ART does not cure HIV infection but suppresses viral replication within a person's body and allows an individual's immune system to strengthen and regain the capacity to fight off infections.In 2016, WHO released the second edition of the Consolidated guidelines on the use of antiretroviral drugs for treating and preventing HIV infection. These guidelines recommend to provide lifelong ART to all people living with HIV, including children, adolescents and adults, pregnant and breastfeeding women, regardless of clinical status or CD4 cell count. By July 2017, 122 countries already have adopted this recommendation by mid-2017, which covers more than 90% of all PLHIV globally.Consolidated guidelines on the use of antiretroviral drugs for treating and preventing HIV infectionThe 2016 guidelines include new alternative ARV options with better tolerability, higher efficacy, and lower rates of treatment discontinuation when compared with medicines being used currently: dolutegravir and low-dose efavirenz for first-line therapy, and raltegravir and darunavir/ritonavir for second-line therapy.Transition to these new ARV options has already started in more than 20 countries and is expected to improve the durability of the treatment and the quality of care of people living with HIV. Despite improvements, limited options remain for infants and young children. For this reason, WHO and partners are coordinating efforts to enable a faster and more effective development and introduction of age-appropriate pediatric formulations of antiretrovirals.In addition, 1 in 3 people living with HIV present to care with advanced disease, at low CD4 counts and at high risk of serious illness and death. To reduce this risk, WHO recommends that these patients receive a “package of care” that includes testing for and prevention of the most common serious infections that can cause death, such as tuberculosis and cryptococcal meningitis, in addition to ART.Based on WHO’s new recommendations to treat all people living with HIV, the number of people eligible for ART has increased from 28 million to all 36.7 million people living with HIV.In mid-2017, 20.9 million people living with HIV were receiving ART globally. In 2016, a global ART coverage of 53% of adults and children living with HIV was reached. However, more efforts are needed to scale up treatment, particularly for children and adolescents. Only 43% of them were receiving ARVs at the end of 2016 and WHO is supporting countries to accelerate their efforts to timely diagnose and treat these vulnerable populations.Expanding access to treatment is at the heart of a new set of targets for 2020 which aim to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030.WHO responseThe Sixty-ninth World Health Assembly endorsed a new Global Health Sector Strategy on HIV for 2016-2021. The strategy includes 5 strategic directions that guide priority actions by countries and by WHO over the next six years.The strategic directions are:Information for focused action (know your epidemic and response).Interventions for impact (covering the range of services needed).Delivering for equity (covering the populations in need of services).Financing for sustainability (covering the costs of services).Innovation for acceleration (looking towards the future).WHO is a cosponsor of the Joint United Nations Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS). Within UNAIDS, WHO leads activities on HIV treatment and care, HIV and tuberculosis co-infection, and jointly coordinates with UNICEF the work on the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

Here are the highlights. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)Correction: An earlier version of this transcript misquoted Bernie Sanders as saying, ""And over the years, I have strongly avoided instant background checks, doing away with this terrible gun show loophole."" He actually said, ""And over the years, I have strongly supported instant background checks, doing away with this terrible gun show loophole."" This version has been corrected.Tuesday night, five candidates participated in the first Democratic debate: Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Martin O'Malley, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee. We've posted the transcript below, with insight from the crew here at The Fix as well as the Fact Checker's Michelle Lee.Click or tap the highlighted part of the transcript to see an annotation; if you would like to leave your own annotations, make sure you have a Genius account . Post staff annotations will appear by default; others are in a menu that you can see in the upper right when you click or tap on an annotation.To kick off the debate, Anderson Cooper introduced himself, Juan Carlos Lopez, Dana Bash, and Don Lemon. Cooper then welcomed each candidate to the stage.COOPER: I want the candidates to be able to introduce themselves to our audience. Each candidate will have two minutes to introduce themselves.Let's begin with Governor Chafee.Governor?CHAFEE: Thank you, Anderson.Thank you, CNN, and thank you Facebook for organizing this debate.Not only will Americans be electing a new president next year, we also will be electing a world leader. Voters should assess the candidate's experience, character and vision for the future as they make this important decision.I'm the only one running for president that has been a mayor, a United States senator, and a governor. As mayor, I brought labor peace to my city and kept taxes down. I was reelected three times. As a senator, I earned a reputation for courageous votes against the Bush-Cheney tax cuts the favored the wealthy, against the tragedy of the Iraq war, for environmental stewardship, for protection of our civil liberties. I served on the Foreign Relations Committee and I chaired the Middle East Subcommittee for four years.As governor, I came in at the depths of the recession and we turned my state around. Rhode Island had the biggest drop of the unemployment rate over my four budgets of all but one state. It happens to be Nevada, where we're having this debate. I'm very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals. I've always been honest. I have the courage to take the long-term view, and I've shown good judgment. I have high ethical standards.As we look to the future, I want to address the income inequality, close the gap between the haves and the have-nots. I want to address climate change, a real threat to our planet. And I believe in prosperity through peace. I want to end these wars.I look forward to the discussion ahead.Thank you (APPLAUSE)COOPER: Thank you very much, Governor.(APPLAUSE)Senator Webb, you have two minutes.WEBB: Thank you.You know, people are disgusted with the way that money has corrupted our political process, intimidating incumbents and empowering Wall Street every day, the turnstile government that we see, and also the power of the financial sector in both parties.WEBB: They're looking for a leader who understands how the system works, who has not been coopted by it, and also has a proven record of accomplishing different things. I have a record of working across the political aisle. I've also spent more than half of my professional life away from politics in the independent world of being an author, a journalist, and a sole proprietor.In government service, I've fought and bled for our country in Vietnam as a Marine. I spent years as Assistant Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Navy -- in the Reagan administration.In the senate, I spoke about economic fairness and social justice from day one. I also wrote and passed the best piece of veterans education legislation in history, the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill. I brought criminal justice reform out of the political shadows and into the national discussion. I led what later became called the Strategic Pivot to Asia two years before President Obama was elected.I know where my loyalties are.My mother grew up in the poverty of east Arkansas chopping cotton, picking strawberries. Three of her seven siblings died in childhood. My wife, Hong, came to this country as a refugee from war torn Vietnam -- learned English, a language that was not spoken at home, and earned her way into Cornell Law School. I have five daughters. Amy works with disabled veterans, Sarah is an emergency room nurse, Julia is a massage therapist, Emily and Georgia are still in school. My son Jim fought as an infantry Marine on the bloody streets of Ramadi.You may be sure that in a Webb administration, the highest priority will be the working people who every day go out and make this country stronger at home, and who give us the right reputation and security overseas under a common sense foreign policy.(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)COOPER: Governor O'Malley, you have two minutes.O'MALLEY: My name is Martin O'Malley, former Mayor of Baltimore, former governor of Maryland, a life long democrat, and most importantly, a husband, and a father.My wife Katie and I have four great kids, Grace, and Tara, and William and Jack. And, like you, there is nothing we wouldn't do to give them healthier and better lives. There are some things that I have learned to do better in life than others. And, after 15 years of executive experience, I have learned how to be an effective leader.Whether it was raising the minimum wage, making our public schools the best in America, passing marriage equality, the DREAM Act, and comprehensive gun safety legislation, I have learned how to get things done because I am very clear about my principals.Thanks to President Obama, our country has come a long way since the Wall Street crash of 2008. Our country's doing better, we are creating jobs again. But we elected a president, not a magician, and there is urgent work that needs to be done right now. For there is a -- deep injustice, an economic injustice that threatens to tear our country apart, and it will not solve itself. Injustice does not solve itself.What I'm talking about is this, our middle class is shrinking. Our poor families are becoming poorer, and 70 percent of us are earning the same, or less than we were 12 years ago. We need new leadership, and we need action. The sort of action that will actually make wages go up again for all American families.Our economy isn't money, it's people. It's all of our people, and so we must invest in our country, and the potential of our kids to make college a debt free option for all of our families, instead of settling our kids with a lifetime of crushing debt.And, we must square our shoulders to the great challenge of climate change and make this threat our opportunity. The future is what we make of it. We are all in this together. And, the question in this election is whether you and I still have the ability to give our kids a better future. I believe we do, that is why I am running for president, and I need your help.Thank you.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Governor O'Malley, thank you very much. Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Anderson, thank you very much. I think most Americans understand that our country today faces a series of unprecedented crises. The middle class of this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing. Millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, and yet almost all of the new income and wealth being created is going to the top one percent.As a result of this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, our campaign finance system is corrupt and is undermining American democracy. Millionaires and billionaires are pouring unbelievable sums of money into the political process in order to fund super PACs and to elect candidates who represent their interests, not the interests of working people.Today, the scientific community is virtually unanimous: climate change is real, it is caused by human activity, and we have a moral responsibility to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy and leave this planet a habitable planet for our children and our grandchildren.Today in America, we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth. African-American youth unemployment is 51 percent. Hispanic youth unemployment is 36 percent. It seems to me that instead of building more jails and providing more incarceration, maybe -- just maybe -- we should be putting money into education and jobs for our kids.(APPLAUSE)What this campaign is about is whether we can mobilize our people to take back our government from a handful of billionaires and create the vibrant democracy we know we can and should have. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)At the first Democratic presidential debate of the 2016 election, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said his campaign is about mobilizing people ""to take back our government from a handful of billionaires."" (CNN)COOPER: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, thank you, and thanks to everyone for hosting this first of the Democratic debates.I'm Hillary Clinton. I have been proud and privileged to serve as first lady, as a senator from New York, and as secretary of state. I'm the granddaughter of a factory worker and the grandmother of a wonderful one-year-old child. And every day, I think about what we need to do to make sure that opportunity is available not just for her, but for all of our children. I have spent a very long time -- my entire adult life -- looking for ways to even the odds to help people have a chance to get ahead, and, in particular, to find the ways for each child to live up to his or her God-given potential.I've traveled across our country over the last months listening and learning, and I've put forward specific plans about how we're going to create more good-paying jobs: by investing in infrastructure and clean energy, by making it possible once again to invest in science and research, and taking the opportunity posed by climate change to grow our economy.At the center of my campaign is how we're going to raise wages. Yes, of course, raise the minimum wage, but we have to do so much more, including finding ways so that companies share profits with the workers who helped to make them.And then we have to figure out how we're going to make the tax system a fairer one. Right now, the wealthy pay too little and the middle class pays too much. So I have specific recommendations about how we're going to close those loopholes, make it clear that the wealthy will have to pay their fair share, and have a series of tax cuts for middle-class families.And I want to do more to help us balance family and work. I believe in equal pay for equal work for women, but I also believe it's about time we had paid family leave for American families and join the rest of the world.(APPLAUSE)During the course of the evening tonight, I'll have a chance to lay out all of my plans and the work that I've done behind them. But for me, this is about bringing our country together again. And I will do everything I can to heal the divides -- the divides economically, because there's too much inequality; the racial divides; the continuing discrimination against the LGBT community -- so that we work together and, yes, finally, fathers will be able to say to their daughters, you, too, can grow up to be president.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Thank you, all. It is time to start the debate.COOPER: Are you all ready?(APPLAUSE)All right. Let's begin. We're going to be discussing a lot of the issues, many of the issues, important issues that you have brought up. But I want to begin with concerns that voters have about each of the candidates here on this stage that they have about each of you.Secretary Clinton, I want to start with you. Plenty of politicians evolve on issues, but even some Democrats believe you change your positions based on political expediency.You were against same-sex marriage. Now you're for it. You defended President Obama's immigration policies. Now you say they're too harsh. You supported his trade deal dozen of times. You even called it the ""gold standard"". Now, suddenly, last week, you're against it.Will you say anything to get elected?CLINTON: Well, actually, I have been very consistent. Over the course of my entire life, I have always fought for the same values and principles, but, like most human beings -- including those of us who run for office -- I do absorb new information. I do look at what's happening in the world.You know, take the trade deal. I did say, when I was secretary of state, three years ago, that I hoped it would be the gold standard. It was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn't meet my standards. My standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans.And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say, ""this will help raise your wages."" And I concluded I could not.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, though, with all due respect, the question is really about political expediency. Just in July, New Hampshire, you told the crowd you'd, quote, ""take a back seat to no one when it comes to progressive values.""Last month in Ohio, you said you plead guilty to, quote, ""being kind of moderate and center."" Do you change your political identity based on who you're talking to?CLINTON: No. I think that, like most people that I know, I have a range of views, but they are rooted in my values and my experience. And I don't take a back seat to anyone when it comes to progressive experience and progressive commitment.You know, when I left law school, my first job was with the Children's Defense Fund, and for all the years since, I have been focused on how we're going to un-stack the deck, and how we're gonna make it possible for more people to have the experience I had.You know, to be able to come from a grandfather who was a factory worker, a father who was a small business person, and now asking the people of America to elect me president.COOPER: Just for the record, are you a progressive, or are you a moderate?CLINTON: I'm a progressive. But I'm a progressive who likes to get things done. And I know...(APPLAUSE)...how to find common ground, and I know how to stand my ground, and I have proved that in every position that I've had, even dealing with Republicans who never had a good word to say about me, honestly. But we found ways to work together on everything from...COOPER: Secretary...CLINTON: ...reforming foster care and adoption to the Children's Health Insurance Program, which insures...COOPER: ...thank you...CLINTON: ...8 million kids. So I have a long history of getting things done, rooted in the same values...COOPER: ...Senator...CLINTON: ...I've always had.Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton defends her ""political identity"" during the first Democratic debate on CNN. (CNN)COOPER: Senator Sanders. A Gallup poll says half the country would not put a socialist in the White House. You call yourself a democratic socialist. How can any kind of socialist win a general election in the United States?SANDERS: Well, we're gonna win because first, we're gonna explain what democratic socialism is.And what democratic socialism is about is saying that it is immoral and wrong that the top one-tenth of 1 percent in this country own almost 90 percent -- almost -- own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. That it is wrong, today, in a rigged economy, that 57 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent.That when you look around the world, you see every other major country providing health care to all people as a right, except the United States. You see every other major country saying to moms that, when you have a baby, we're not gonna separate you from your newborn baby, because we are going to have -- we are gonna have medical and family paid leave, like every other country on Earth.Those are some of the principles that I believe in, and I think we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway, and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Denmark is a country that has a population -- Denmark is a country that has a population of 5.6 million people. The question is really about electability here, and that's what I'm trying to get at.You -- the -- the Republican attack ad against you in a general election -- it writes itself. You supported the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. You honeymooned in the Soviet Union. And just this weekend, you said you're not a capitalist.Doesn't -- doesn't that ad write itself?SANDERS: Well, first of all, let's look at the facts. The facts that are very simple. Republicans win when there is a low voter turnout, and that is what happened last November.Sixty-three percent of the American people didn't vote, Anderson. Eighty percent of young people didn't vote. We are bringing out huge turnouts, and creating excitement all over this country.Democrats at the White House on down will win, when there is excitement and a large voter turnout, and that is what this campaign is doing.COOPER: You don't consider yourself a capitalist, though?SANDERS: Do I consider myself part of the casino capitalist process by which so few have so much and so many have so little by which Wall Street's greed and recklessness wrecked this economy? No, I don't.I believe in a society where all people do well. Not just a handful of billionaires.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Just let me just be clear. Is there anybody else on the stage who is not a capitalist?CLINTON: Well, let me just follow-up on that, Anderson, because when I think about capitalism, I think about all the small businesses that were started because we have the opportunity and the freedom in our country for people to do that and to make a good living for themselves and their families.And I don't think we should confuse what we have to do every so often in America, which is save capitalism from itself. And I think what Senator Sanders is saying certainly makes sense in the terms of the inequality that we have.But we are not Denmark. I love Denmark. We are the United States of America. And it's our job to rein in the excesses of capitalism so that it doesn't run amok and doesn't cause the kind of inequities we're seeing in our economic system.But we would be making a grave mistake to turn our backs on what built the greatest middle class in the history...COOPER: Senator Sanders?CLINTON: ... of the world.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I think everybody is in agreement that we are a great entrepreneurial nation. We have got to encourage that. Of course, we have to support small and medium-sized businesses.But you can have all of the growth that you want and it doesn't mean anything if all of the new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. So what we need to do is support small and medium-sized businesses, the backbone of our economy, but we have to make sure that every family in this country gets a fair shake...COOPER: We're going to get...SANDERS: ... not just for billionaires.COOPER: We're going to have a lot more on these issues. But I do want to just quickly get everybody in on the question of electability.Governor Chafee, you've been everything but a socialist. When you were senator from Rhode Island, you were a Republican. When you were elected governor, you were an independent. You've only been a Democrat for little more than two years. Why should Democratic voters trust you won't change again?CHAFEE: Anderson, you're looking at a block of granite when it comes to the issues. Whether it's...(CROSSTALK)COOPER: It seems like pretty soft granite. I mean, you've been a Republican, you've been an independent.CHAFEE: Did you hear what I said? On the issues. I have not changed on the issues. I was a liberal Republican, then I was an independent, and now I'm a proud Democrat. But I have not changed on the issues.And I open my record to scrutiny. Whether it's on the environment, a woman's right to choose, gay marriage, fiscal responsibility, aversion to foreign entanglements, using the tools of government to help the less fortunate.Time and time again, I have never changed. You're looking at a block of granite when it comes to the issues. So I have not changed.At the democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas, candidate Lincoln Chafee says he has ""not changed"" on the issues. (CNN)COOPER: Then why change labels?CHAFEE: The party left me. There's no doubt about that. There was no room for a liberal moderate Republican in that party. I even had a primary for my reelection in 2006. I won it. But the money poured in to defeat me in Rhode Island as a Republican. That's what we were up against.COOPER: Governor O'Malley, the concern of voters about you is that you tout our record as Baltimore's mayor. As we all know, we all saw it. That city exploded in riots and violence in April.The current top prosecutor in Baltimore, also a Democrat, blames your zero tolerance policies for sowing the seeds of unrest. Why should Americans trust you with the country when they see what's going on in the city that you ran for more than seven years?O'MALLEY: Yes, actually, I believe what she said was that there's a lot of policies that have led to this unrest.But, Anderson, when I ran for mayor of Baltimore in 1999...COOPER: She actually -- just for the record, when she was asked which policies, to name two, she said zero tolerance. I mean, there's a number of old policies that we're seeing the results of. That distress of communities, where communities don't want to step forward and say who killed a 3-year-old, it's a direct result of these failed policies.O'MALLEY: Well, let's talk about this a little bit. One of the things that was not reported during that heartbreaking night of unrest in Baltimore was that arrests had actually fallen to a 38-year low in the year prior to the Freddie Gray's tragic death.Anderson, when I ran for mayor of Baltimore back in 1999, it was not because our city was doing well. It was because we allowed ourselves to become the most violent, addicted, and abandoned city in America.And I ran and promised people that together we could turn that around. And we put our city on a path to reduce violent crime, or part one (ph) crime by more than any other major city in America over the next 10 years.I did not make our city immune to setbacks. But I attended a lot of funerals, including one for a family of seven who were firebombed in their sleep for picking up the phone in a poor African-American neighborhood and calling the police because of drug dealers on their corner.We've saved over a thousand lives in Baltimore in the last 15 years of people working together. And the vast majority of them were young and poor and black. It wasn't easy on any day. But we saved lives and we gave our city a better future, improving police and community relations every single day that I was in office.COOPER: In one year alone, though, 100,000 arrests were made in your city, a city of 640,000 people. The ACLU, the NAACP sued you, sued the city, and the city actually settled, saying a lot of those arrests were without probable cause.O'MALLEY: Well, I think the key word in your followup there was the word ""settle."" That's true. It was settled. Arrests peaked in 2003, Anderson, but they declined every year after that as we restored peace in our poorer neighborhoods so that people could actually walk and not have to worry about their kids or their loved ones of being victims of violent crime.Look, none of this is easy. None of us has all the answers. But together as a city, we saved a lot of lives. It was about leadership. It was about principle. And it was about bringing people together.COOPER: Thank you, Governor.O'MALLEY: Thank you.COOPER: Senator Webb, in 2006, you called affirmative action ""state-sponsored racism."" In 2010, you wrote an op/ed saying it discriminates against whites. Given that nearly half the Democratic Party is non-white, aren't you out of step with where the Democratic Party is now?WEBB: No, actually I believe that I am where the Democratic Party traditionally has been. The Democratic Party, and the reason I've decided to run as a Democrat, has been the party that gives people who otherwise have no voice in the corridors of power a voice. And that is not determined by race.And as a clarification, I have always supported affirmative action for African Americans. That's the way the program was originally designed because of their unique history in this country, with slavery and the Jim Crow laws that followed. What I have discussed a number of times is the idea that when we create diversity programs that include everyone, quote, ""of color,"" other than whites, struggling whites like the families in the Appalachian mountains, we're not being true to the Democratic Party principle of elevating the level of consciousness among our people about the hardships that a lot of people who happen to be have -- by culture, by the way.COOPER: Senator Webb, thank you very much.Let's move on to some of the most pressing issues facing our country right now, some of the biggest issues right now in the headlines today. We're going to start with guns. The shooting in Oregon earlier this month, once again it brought the issue of guns into the national conversation. Over the last week, guns have been the most discussed political topic on Facebook by two to one.Senator Sanders, you voted against the Brady bill that mandated background checks and a waiting period. You also supported allowing riders to bring guns in checked bags on Amtrak trains. For a decade, you said that holding gun manufacturers legally responsible for mass shootings is a bad idea. Now, you say you're reconsidering that. Which is it: shield the gun companies from lawsuits or not?SANDERS: Let's begin, Anderson, by understanding that Bernie Sanders has a D-minus voting rating (ph) from the NRA. Let's also understand that back in 1988 when I first ran for the United States Congress, way back then, I told the gun owners of the state of Vermont and I told the people of the state of Vermont, a state which has virtually no gun control, that I supported a ban on assault weapons. And over the years, I have strongly supported instant background checks, doing away with this terrible gun show loophole. And I think we've got to move aggressively at the federal level in dealing with the straw man purchasers. Correction: An earlier version of this transcript misquoted Bernie Sanders as saying, ""And over the years, I have strongly avoided instant background checks, doing away with this terrible gun show loophole."" He actually said that he has ""strongly supported"" instant background checks.Also I believe, and I've fought for, to understand that there are thousands of people in this country today who are suicidal, who are homicidal, but can't get the healthcare that they need, the mental healthcare, because they don't have insurance or they're too poor. I believe that everybody in this country who has a mental crisis has got to get mental health counseling immediately. COOPER: Do you want to shield gun companies from lawsuits?SANDERS: Of course not. This was a large and complicated bill. There were provisions in it that I think made sense. For example, do I think that a gun shop in the state of Vermont that sells legally a gun to somebody, and that somebody goes out and does something crazy, that that gun shop owner should be held responsible? I don't.On the other hand, where you have manufacturers and where you have gun shops knowingly giving guns to criminals or aiding and abetting that, of course we should take action.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, is Bernie Sanders tough enough on guns?CLINTON: No, not at all. I think that we have to look at the fact that we lose 90 people a day from gun violence. This has gone on too long and it's time the entire country stood up against the NRA. The majority of our country...(APPLAUSE)... supports background checks, and even the majority of gun owners do.Senator Sanders did vote five times against the Brady bill. Since it was passed, more than 2 million prohibited purchases have been prevented. He also did vote, as he said, for this immunity provision. I voted against it. I was in the Senate at the same time. It wasn't that complicated to me. It was pretty straightforward to me that he was going to give immunity to the only industry in America. Everybody else has to be accountable, but not the gun manufacturers. And we need to stand up and say: Enough of that. We're not going to let it continue.At the first Democratic presidential debate of the 2016 election, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton said Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is not tough enough on guns. (CNN)(APPLAUSE)COOPER: We're going to bring you all in on this. But, Senator Sanders, you have to give a response.SANDERS: As a senator from a rural state, what I can tell Secretary Clinton, that all the shouting in the world is not going to do what I would hope all of us want, and that is keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have those guns and end this horrible violence that we are seeing.I believe that there is a consensus in this country. A consensus has said we need to strengthen and expand instant background checks, do away with this gun show loophole, that we have to address the issue of mental health, that we have to deal with the strawman purchasing issue, and that when we develop that consensus, we can finally, finally do something to address this issue.COOPER: Governor O'Malley, you passed gun legislation as governor of Maryland, but you had a Democratic-controlled legislature. President Obama couldn't convince Congress to pass gun legislation after the massacres in Aurora, in Newtown, and Charleston. How can you?O'MALLEY: And, Anderson, I also had to overcome a lot of opposition in the leadership of my own party to get this done. Look, it's fine to talk about all of these things -- and I'm glad we're talking about these things -- but I've actually done them.We passed comprehensive gun safety legislation, not by looking at the pollings or looking at what the polls said. We actually did it. And, Anderson, here tonight in our audience are two people that make this issue very, very real. Sandy and Lonnie Phillips are here from Colorado. And their daughter, Jessie, was one of those who lost their lives in that awful mass shooting in Aurora.Now, to try to transform their grief, they went to court, where sometimes progress does happen when you file in court, but in this case, you want to talk about a -- a rigged game, Senator? The game was rigged. A man had sold 4,000 rounds of military ammunition to this -- this person that killed their daughter, riddled her body with five bullets, and he didn't even ask where it was going.And not only did their case get thrown out of court, they were slapped with $200,000 in court fees because of the way that the NRA gets its way in our Congress and we take a backseat. It's time to stand up and pass comprehensive gun safety legislation as a nation.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Senator Sanders, I want you to be able to respond, 30 seconds.SANDERS: I think the governor gave a very good example about the weaknesses in that law and I think we have to take another look at it. But here is the point, Governor. We can raise our voices, but I come from a rural state, and the views on gun control in rural states are different than in urban states, whether we like it or not.Our job is to bring people together around strong, commonsense gun legislation. I think there is a vast majority in this country who want to do the right thing, and I intend to lead the country in bringing our people together.O'MALLEY: Senator -- Senator, excuse me.(CROSSTALK)O'MALLEY: Senator, it is not about rural -- Senator, it was not about rural and urban.SANDERS: It's exactly about rural.O'MALLEY: Have you ever been to the Eastern Shore? Have you ever been to Western Maryland? We were able to pass this and still respect the hunting traditions of people who live in our rural areas.SANDERS: Governor...O'MALLEY: And we did it by leading with principle, not by pandering to the NRA and backing down to the NRA.SANDERS: Well, as somebody who has a D-minus voting record...(CROSSTALK)O'MALLEY: And I have an F from the NRA, Senator.SANDERS: I don't think I am pandering. But you have not been in the United States Congress.O'MALLEY: Well, maybe that's a healthy thing.(LAUGHTER)SANDERS: And when you want to, check it out. And if you think -- if you think that we can simply go forward and pass something tomorrow without bringing people together, you are sorely mistaken.COOPER: Let me bring in somebody who has a different viewpoint. Senator Webb, your rating from the NRA, you once had an A rating from the NRA. You've said gun violence goes down when more people are allowed to carry guns. Would encouraging more people to be armed be part of your response to a mass shooting?WEBB: Look, there are two fundamental issues that are involved in this discussion. We need to pay respect to both of them. The first is the issue of who should be kept from having guns and using firearms. And we have done not a good job on that.A lot of them are criminals. And a lot of the people are getting killed are members of gangs inside our urban areas. And a lot of them are mentally incapacitated. And the shooting in Virginia Tech in '07, this individual had received medical care for mental illness from three different professionals who were not allowed to share the information.WEBB: So we do need background checks. We need to keep the people who should not have guns away from them. But we have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence.COOPER: Senator...WEBB: May I? People are going back and forth here for 10 minutes here. There are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The average American does not have that, and deserves the right to be able to protect their family.COOPER: Senator -- Governor Chafee, you have an F rating from the NRA, what do you think about what Senator Webb just said?CHAFEE: Yes, I have a good record of voting for gun commonsense safety legislation, but the reality is, despite these tragedies that happen time and time again, when legislators step up to pass commonsense gun safety legislation, the gun lobby moves in and tells the people they're coming to take away your guns.And, they're successful at it, in Colorado and others states, the legislators that vote for commonsense gun safety measures then get defeated. I even saw in Rhode Island. So, I would bring the gun lobby in and say we've got to change this. Where can we find common ground? Wayne Lapierre from the NRA, whoever it is, the leaders. Come one, we've go to change this. We're not coming to take away your guns, we believe in the Second Amendment, but let's find common ground here.COOPER: I want to...O'MALLEY: ...Anderson, when the NRA wrote to everyone in our state -- when the NRA wrote to members in our state and told people with hunting traditions lies about what our comprehensive gun safety legislation is, I wrote right back to them and laid out what it actually did. And that's why, not only did we pass it, but the NRA didn't...SANDERS: ...Excuse me...O'MALLEY: ...dare to petition a referendum...SANDERS: ...I want to make...O'MALLEY: ...Because we built a public consensus... COOPER: ...I want to move on to another issue, which is in the headlines right now, another crisis making headlines.Secretary Clinton, Russia, they're challenging the U.S. in Syria. According to U.S. intelligence, they've lied about who they're bombing. You spearheaded the reset with Russia. Did you underestimate the Russians, and as president, what would your response to Vladimir Putin be right now in Syria?CLINTON: Well, first of all, we got a lot of business done with the Russians when Medvedev was the president, and not Putin. We got a nuclear arms deal, we got the Iranian sanctions, we got an ability to bring important material and equipment to our soldiers in Afghanistan.There's no doubt that when Putin came back in and said he was going to be President, that did change the relationship. We have to stand up to his bullying, and specifically in Syria, it is important -- and I applaud the administration because they are engaged in talks right now with the Russians to make it clear that they've got to be part of the solution to try to end that bloody conflict.And, to -- provide safe zones so that people are not going to have to be flooding out of Syria at the rate they are. And, I think it's important too that the United States make it very clear to Putin that it's not acceptable for him to be in Syria creating more chaos, bombing people on behalf of Assad, and we can't do that if we don't take more of a leadership position, which is what I'm advocating.COOPER: Senator Sanders, what would you do differently.SANDERS: Well, let's understand that when we talk about Syria, you're talking about a quagmire in a quagmire. You're talking about groups of people trying to overthrow Assad, other groups of people fighting ISIS. You're talking about people who are fighting ISIS using their guns to overthrow Assad, and vice versa.I'm the former chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee, and in that capacity I learned a very powerful lesson about the cost of war, and I will do everything that I can to make sure that the United States does not get involved in another quagmire like we did in Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country. We should be putting together a coalition of Arab countries who should be leading the effort. We should be supportive, but I do not support American ground troops in Syria.At the first Democratic presidential debate of the 2016 election, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) discussed the Iraq war and Syria. (CNN)COOPER: On this issue of foreign policy, I want to go to...CLINTON: ...Well, nobody does. Nobody does, Senator Sanders.COOPER: I want to go to Dana Bash. Dana?BASH: Governor Chafee, you were the only Republican in the Senate to vote against the Iraq war. You say Secretary Clinton should be disqualified from the presidency because she voted in favor of using force in Iraq. She has since said that her vote was a mistake. Why isn't that good enough?CHAFEE: Well, we just heard Senator Sanders say that it's the worst decision in American history. That's very significant, the worst decision in American history, I just heard from Senator Sanders.So, as we look ahead, if you're going to make those poor judgment calls, a critical time in our history, we just finished with the Vietnam era, getting back into another quagmire -- if you're looking ahead, and you're looking at someone who made that poor decision in 2002 to go into Iraq when there was no real evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq -- I know because I did my homework, and, so, that's an indication of how someone will perform in the future. And that's what's important.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Secretary Clinton, he's questioning your judgment.CLINTON: Well, I recall very well being on a debate stage, I think, about 25 times with then Senator Obama, debating this very issue. After the election, he asked me to become Secretary of State.He valued my judgment, and I spent a lot of time with him...(APPLAUSE)...in the Situation Room, going over some very difficult issues.You know, I -- I agree completely. We don't want American troops on the ground in Syria. I never said that. What I said was we had to put together a coalition -- in fact, something that I worked on before I left the State Department -- to do, and yes, that it should include Arabs, people in the region.Because what I worry about is what will happen with ISIS gaining more territory, having more reach, and, frankly, posing a threat to our friends and neighbors in the region and far beyond.So I think while you're talking about the tough decision that President Obama had to make about Osama bin Laden, where I was one of his few advisers, or putting together that coalition to impose sanctions on Iran -- I think I have a lot of evidence...(CROSSTALK)BASH: Senator Sanders -- Senator Sanders, I want to bring you in here. My question for you is, as a congressman, you voted against the Iraq War. You voted against the Gulf War. You're just talking about Syria, but under what circumstances would a President Sanders actually use force?SANDERS: Let me just respond to something the secretary said. First of all, she is talking about, as I understand it, a no-fly zone in Syria, which I think is a very dangerous situation. Could lead to real problems.Second of all, I heard the same evidence from President Bush and Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld about why we should overthrow Saddam Hussein and get involved in the -- I would urge people to go to berniesanders.com, hear what I said in 2002. And I say, without any joy in my heart, that much of what I thought would happen about the destabilization, in fact, did happen.So I think... BASH: All right.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I think the president is trying very hard to thread a tough needle here, and that is to support those people who are against Assad, against ISIS, without getting us on the ground there, and that's the direction I believe we should have (inaudible).COOPER: But, Senator Sanders, you didn't answer the question. Under what -- under what circumstances would you actually use force?SANDERS: Well, obviously, I voted, when President Clinton said, ""let's stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo,"" I voted for that. I voted to make sure that Osama bin Laden was held accountable in Afghanistan.When our country is threatened, or when our allies are threatened, I believe that we need coalitions to come together to address the major crises of this country. I do not support the United States getting involved in unilateral action.(UNKNOWN): You're at work with our allies.(CROSSTALK)COOPER: I'm gonna bring you all in on this. Governor -- Governor O'Malley, Secretary Clinton...SANDERS: I don't believe that any...(CROSSTALK)COOPER: Secretary Clinton voted to authorize military force in Iraq, supported more troops in Afghanistan. As Secretary of State, she wanted to arm Syrian rebels and push for the bombing of Libya. Is she too quick to use military force?O'MALLEY: Anderson, no president -- no commander in chief -- should take the military option off the table, even if most of us would agree that it should be the last option.What disturbed people so much about -- and I would agree with Senator Sanders on this -- leading us into Iraq under false pretenses and telling us, as a people, that there were weapons of mass destruction there was -- was one of the worst blunders in modern American history.But the reason why people remain angry about it is because people feel like a lot of our legislators got railroaded in a war fever and by polls. And I remember being at a dinner shortly before that invasion. People were talking at -- and saying, ""it'll take us just a couple years to rebuild democracy,"" and I thought, ""has this world gone mad?""Whenever we go -- and contrary to John Quincy Adams' advice -- ""searching the world for monsters to destroy,"" and when we use political might to take a -- at the expense of democratic principle, we hurt ourselves, and we hurt our (inaudible).COOPER: Does she -- does she want to use military force too rapidly?O'MALLEY: I believe that, as president, I would not be so quick to pull for a military tool. I believe that a no-fly zone in Syria, at this time, actually, Secretary, would be a mistake.You have to enforce no-fly zones, and I believe, especially with the Russian air force in the air, it could lead to an escalation because of an accident that we would deeply regret.I support President Obama. I think we have to play a long game, and I think, ultimately -- you want to talk about blunders? I think Assad's invasion of Syria will be seen as a blunder.COOPER: Governor O'Malley, just for the record, on the campaign trail, you've been saying that Secretary Clinton is always quick for the -- for the military intervention. Senator -- Secretary Clinton, you can respond.CLINTON: Well, first of all, I...WEBB: Anderson, can I come into this discussion at some point?COOPER: Well -- yes, you'll be coming in next, but she was directly quoted, Senator.WEBB: Thank you. I've been standing over here for about ten minutes, trying.COOPER: OK.WEBB: It's just -- it's gone back and forth over there.COOPER: Secretary?CLINTON: Well, I am in the middle, here, and...(LAUGHTER)Lots of things coming from all directions.WEBB: You got the lucky (inaudible).CLINTON: You know, I have to say, I was very pleased when Governor O'Malley endorsed me for president in 2008, and I enjoyed his strong support in that campaign. And I consider him, obviously, a friend.Let me say -- because there's a lot of loose talk going on here -- we are already flying in Syria just as we are flying in Iraq. The president has made a very tough decision. What I believe and why I have advocated that the no-fly zone -- which of course would be in a coalition -- be put on the table is because I'm trying to figure out what leverage we have to get Russia to the table. You know, diplomacy is not about getting to the perfect solution. It's about how you balance the risks.COOPER: Thank you.CLINTON: And I think we have an opportunity here -- and I know that inside the administration this is being hotly debated -- to get that leverage to try to get the Russians to have to deal with everybody in the region and begin to move toward a political, diplomatic solution in Syria.COOPER: Thank you, Secretary.(CROSSTALK)COOPER: Senator Webb, you said as president you would never have used military force in Libya and that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was, in your words, ""inevitable."" Should Secretary Clinton have seen that attack coming?WEBB: Look, let's start -- I've been trying to get in this conversation for about 10 minutes -- let's start with why Russia is in Syria right now. There are three strategic failings that have allowed this to occur. The first was the invasion of Iraq, which destabilized ethnic elements in Iraq and empowered Iran. The second was the Arab Spring, which created huge vacuums in Libya and in Syria that allowed terrorist movements to move in there. And the third was the recent deal allowing Iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon, which sent bad signals, bad body language into the region about whether we are acquiescing in Iran becoming a stronger piece of the formula in that part of the world.Now, I say this as someone who spent five years in the Pentagon and who opposed the war in Iraq, whose son fought in Iraq, I've fought in Vietnam. But if you want a place where we need to be in terms of our national strategy, a focus, the greatest strategic threat that we have right now is resolving our relationship with China. And we need to do this because of their aggression in the region. We need to do it because of the way they treat their own people.COOPER: Senator...WEBB: And I would say this. I've been waiting for 10 minutes. I will say this.COOPER: You're over your time as of now.WEBB: I will -- well, you've let a lot of people go over their time. I would say this...COOPER: You agreed to these debate rules.WEBB: ... to the unelected, authoritarian government of China: You do not own the South China Sea. You do not have the right to conduct cyber warfare against tens of millions of American citizens. And in a Webb administration, we will do something about that.COOPER: Senator Sanders, I want you to be able to respond.SANDERS: Pardon me?COOPER: I'd like you to be able to respond and get in on this.SANDERS: Well, I think Mr. Putin is going to regret what he is doing. I think that when he gets into that...COOPER: He doesn't seem to be the type of guy to regret a lot.SANDERS: Well, I think he's already regretting what he did in Crimea and what he is doing in the Ukraine. I think he is really regretting the decline of his economy. And I think what he is trying to do now is save some face. But I think when Russians get killed in Syria and when he gets bogged down, I think the Russian people are going to give him a message that maybe they should come home, maybe they should start working with the United States to rectify the situation now.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, on the campaign trail, Governor Webb has said that he would never have used military force in Libya and that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was inevitable. Should you have seen that attack coming?CLINTON: Well, let's remember what was going on. We had a murderous dictator, Gadhafi, who had American blood on his hands, as I'm sure you remember, threatening to massacre large numbers of the Libyan people. We had our closest allies in Europe burning up the phone lines begging us to help them try to prevent what they saw as a mass genocide, in their words. And we had the Arabs standing by our side saying, ""We want you to help us deal with Gadhafi.""Our response, which I think was smart power at its best, is that the United States will not lead this. We will provide essential, unique capabilities that we have, but the Europeans and the Arabs had to be first over the line. We did not put one single American soldier on the ground in Libya. And I'll say this for the Libyan people...COOPER: But American citizens did lose their lives in Benghazi.CLINTON: But let -- I'll get to that. But I think it's important, since I understand Senator Webb's very strong feelings about this, to explain where we were then and to point out that I think President Obama made the right decision at the time.And the Libyan people had a free election the first time since 1951. And you know what, they voted for moderates, they voted with the hope of democracy. Because of the Arab Spring, because of a lot of other things, there was turmoil to be followed.But unless you believe the United States should not send diplomats to any place that is dangerous, which I do not, then when we send them forth, there is always the potential for danger and risk.Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton at the Democratic presidential debate on Oct. 13 defends the Obama administration's actions leading up to the attack on American diplomats in Benghazi in 2012. (CNN)COOPER: Governor O'Malley?O'MALLEY: Anderson, I think we are learning...(CROSSTALK)O'MALLEY: Anderson, I think there's lessons to be learned from Benghazi. And those lessons are that we need to do a much better job as a nation of having human intelligence on the ground so that we know who the emerging next generation leaders are that are coming up to replace a dictator when his time on this planet ends.And I believe that's what Chris Stevens was trying to do. But he did not have the tools. We have failed as a country to invest in the human intelligence that would allow us to make not only better decisions in Libya, but better decisions in Syria today.And it's a huge national security failing.COOPER: Senator Webb, I want you to be able to respond.WEBB: Thank you.(CROSSTALK)COOPER: Senator Webb? WEBB: This is not about Benghazi per se. To me it is the inevitability of something like Benghazi occurring in the way that we intervened in Libya. We had no treaties at risk. We had no Americans at risk. There was no threat of attack or imminent attack.There is plenty of time for a president to come to the Congress and request authority to use military force in that situation. I called for it on the Senate floor again and again. I called for it in Senate hearings.It is not a wise thing to do. And if people think it was a wise thing to do, try to get to the Tripoli airport today. You can't do it.COOPER: Secretary (sic) Webb, you served in Vietnam. You're a marine. Once a marine, always a marine. You served as a marine in Vietnam. You're a decorated war hero. You eventually became secretary of the navy.During the Vietnam War, the man standing next to you, Senator Sanders, applied for status as a conscientious objector. Given his history, can he serve as a credible commander-in-chief?WEBB: Everybody makes their decisions when the time there is conscription. And as long as they go through the legal process that our country requires, I respect that. And it would be for the voters to decide whether Senator Sanders or anyone else should be president.I will say this, coming from the position that I've come from, from a military family, with my brother a marine, my son was a marine in Iraq, I served as a marine, spending five years in the Pentagon, I am comfortable that I am the most qualified person standing up here today to be your commander-in-chief.COOPER: Senator Sanders, tell an American soldier who is watching right now tonight in Afghanistan why you can be commander-in- chief given that you applied for conscientious objector status.SANDERS: Well, first of all, let me applaud my good friend Jim Webb for his service to this country in so many ways.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Jim and I, under Jim's leadership, as he indicated, passed the most significant veterans education bill in recent history. We followed suit with a few years later passing, under my leadership, the most significant veterans' health care legislation in the modern history of this country.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: When I was a young man -- I'm not a young man today. When I was a young man, I strongly opposed the war in Vietnam. Not the brave men like Jim who fought in that war, but the policy which got us involved in that war. That was my view then.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I am not a pacifist, Anderson. I supported the war in Afghanistan. I supported President Clinton's effort to deal with ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. I support air strikes in Syria and what the president is trying to do.Yes, I happen to believe from the bottom of my heart that war should be the last resort that we have got to exercise diplomacy. But yes, I am prepared to take this country into war if that is necessary.Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders says war should be ""the last result"" after he was asked about objecting to the Vietnam War. (CNN)(CROSSTALK)COOPER: Very quickly, 30 seconds for each of you. Governor Chafee, who or what is the greatest national security threat to the United States? I want to go down the line.CHAFEE: OK. I just have to answer one thing that Senator Webb said about the Iran deal, because I'm a strong proponent of what President Obama -- and he said that because of that the Iran deal that enabled Russia to come in.No, that's not true, Senator Webb. I respect your foreign policy chops. But Russia is aligned with Iran and with Assad and the Alawite Shias in Syria. So that Iran deal did not allow Russia to come in.COOPER: OK. Senator, I can give you 30 seconds to respond.WEBB: I believe that the signal that we sent to the region when the Iran nuclear deal was concluded was that we are accepting Iran's greater position on this very important balance of power, among our greatest ally Israel, and the Sunnis represented by the Saudi regime, and Iran. It was a position of weakness and I think it encouraged the acts that we've seen in the past several weeks.COOPER: Thirty seconds for each of you. Governor Chafee, what is the greatest national security threat to the United States?CHAFEE: It's certainly the chaos in the Middle East. There's no doubt about it.COOPER: OK.CHAFEE: And it all started with the Iraq invasion.COOPER: Governor O'Malley?O'MALLEY: I believe that nuclear Iran remains the biggest threat, along with the threat of ISIL; climate change, of course, makes cascading threats even more (inaudible).COOPER: Secretary Clinton, the greatest national security threat?CLINTON: I -- I think it has to be continued threat from the spread of nuclear weapons, nuclear material that can fall into the wrong hands. I know the terrorists are constantly seeking it, and that's why we have to stay vigilant, but also united around the world to prevent that.COOPER: Senator Sanders, greatest national security threat?SANDERS: The scientific community is telling us that if we do not address the global crisis of climate change, transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to sustainable energy, the planet that we're going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren may well not be habitable. That is a major crisis.COOPER: Senator Webb?WEBB: Our greatest long-term strategic challenge is our relation with China. Our greatest day-to-day threat is cyber warfare against this country. Our greatest military-operational threat is resolving the situations in the Middle East.COOPER: All right. We're going to take a short break. Do these candidates see eye to eye on an issue that is driving a big wedge between Republicans? That is next.We'll be right back.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)COOPER: And welcome back. We are live in Nevada, in Las Vegas, at the Wynn Resort for the first Democratic presidential debate. The questions continue.We begin with Secretary Clinton. Secretary Clinton, you are going to be testifying before Congress next week about your e-mails. For the last eight months, you haven't been able to put this issue behind you. You dismissed it; you joked about it; you called it a mistake. What does that say about your ability to handle far more challenging crises as president?CLINTON: Well, I've taken responsibility for it. I did say it was a mistake. What I did was allowed by the State Department, but it wasn't the best choice.And I have been as transparent as I know to be, turning over 55,000 pages of my e-mails, asking that they be made public. And you're right. I am going to be testifying. I've been asking to testify for some time and to do it in public, which was not originally agreed to.But let's just take a minute here and point out that this committee is basically an arm of the Republican National Committee.(APPLAUSE)It is a partisan vehicle, as admitted by the House Republican majority leader, Mr. McCarthy, to drive down my poll numbers. Big surprise. And that's what they have attempted to do.I am still standing. I am happy to be part of this debate.(APPLAUSE)And I intend to keep talking about the issues that matter to the American people. You know, I believe strongly that we need to be talking about what people talk to me about, like how are we going to make college affordable? How are we going to pay down student debt?COOPER: Secretary...CLINTON: How are we going to get health care for everybody...(CROSSTALK)COOPER: Secretary Clinton, Secretary Clinton, with all due respect, it's a little hard -- I mean, isn't it a little bit hard to call this just a partisan issue? There's an FBI investigation, and President Obama himself just two days ago said this is a legitimate issue.CLINTON: Well, I never said it wasn't legitimate. I said that I have answered all the questions and I will certainly be doing so again before this committee.But I think it would be really unfair not to look at the entire picture. This committee has spent $4.5 million of taxpayer money, and they said that they were trying to figure out what we could do better to protect our diplomats so that something like Benghazi wouldn't happen again. There were already seven committee reports about what to do. So I think it's pretty clear what their obvious goal is.COOPER: Thank you.CLINTON: But I'll be there. I'll answer their questions. But tonight, I want to talk not about my e-mails, but about what the American people want from the next president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Let me say this.(APPLAUSE)Let me say -- let me say something that may not be great politics. But I think the secretary is right, and that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Thank you. Me, too. Me, too.Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders responded to a question about Hillary Clinton's e-mails. (CNN)SANDERS: You know? The middle class -- Anderson, and let me say something about the media, as well. I go around the country, talk to a whole lot of people. Middle class in this country is collapsing. We have 27 million people living in poverty. We have massive wealth and income inequality. Our trade policies have cost us millions of decent jobs. The American people want to know whether we're going to have a democracy or an oligarchy as a result of Citizens Union. Enough of the e-mails. Let's talk about the real issues facing America.(APPLAUSE)Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders did not mince words at the first Democratic debate in Las Vegas, where he talked about Wall Street, NSA surveillance and climate change. (Victoria M. Walker/The Washington Post)CLINTON: Thank you, Bernie. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: It's obviously very popular in this crowd, and it's -- hold on.(APPLAUSE)I know that plays well in this room. But I got to be honest, Governor Chafee, for the record, on the campaign trail, you've said a different thing. You said this is a huge issue. Standing here in front of Secretary Clinton, are you willing to say that to her face?CHAFEE: Absolutely. We have to repair American credibility after we told the world that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which he didn't. So there's an issue of American credibility out there. So any time someone is running to be our leader, and a world leader, which the American president is, credibility is an issue out there with the world. And we have repair work to be done. I think we need someone that has the best in ethical standards as our next president. That's how I feel.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?CLINTON: No.Governor O'Malley...(APPLAUSE)Governor, it's popular in the room, but a lot of people do want to know these answers.Governor O'Malley, you expressed concern on the campaign trail that the Democratic Party is, and I quote, ""being defined by Hillary Clinton's email scandal.""You heard her answer, do you still feel that way tonight?O'MALLEY: I believe that now that we're finally having debates, Anderson, that we don't have to be defined by the email scandal, and how long -- what the FBI's asking about. Instead, we can talk about affordable college, making college debt free, and all the issues. Which is why -- and I see the chair of the DNC here, look how glad we are actually to be talking about the issues that matter the most to people around the kitchen table.We need to get wages to go up, college more affordable...COOPER: ...Thank you, governor.O'MALLEY: ...we need to make American 100 percent clean electric by 2050.COOPER: I want to talk about issues of race in America, for that I want to start of with Don Lemon.LEMON: Alright, Anderson, thank you very much. I'm not sure how to follow that, but this question is about something that has tripped some of the candidates up out on the campaign trail. Can you hear me?Can't hear me in the room. OK, here we go again, as I said...WILKINS: ...law school. My question for the candidates is, do black lives matter, or do all lives matter?COOPER: The question from Arthur...LEMON: ...There we go...COOPER: ...Do black lives matter, or do all lives matter? Let's put that question to Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Black lives matter.(CHEERING)SANDERS: And the reason -- the reason those words matter is the African American community knows that on any given day some innocent person like Sandra Bland can get into a car, and then three days later she's going to end up dead in jail, or their kids...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: ...are going to get shot. We need to combat institutional racism from top to bottom, and we need major, major reforms in a broken criminal justice system...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: ...In which we have more people in jail than China. And, I intended to tackle that issue. To make sure that our people have education and jobs rather than jail cells.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Governor O'Malley, the question from Arthur was do black lives matter, or do all lives matter?O'MALLEY: Anderson, the point that the Black Lives Matter movement is making is a very, very legitimate and serious point, and that is that as a nation we have undervalued the lives of black lives, people of color.When I ran for Mayor of Baltimore -- and we we burying over 350 young men ever single year, mostly young, and poor, and black, and I said to our legislature, at the time when I appeared in front of them as a mayor, that if we were burying white, young, poor men in these number we would be marching in the streets and there would be a different reaction.Black lives matter, and we have a lot of work to do to reform our criminal justice system, and to address race relations in our country.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Secretary Clinton, what would you do for African Americans in this country that President Obama couldn't?CLINTON: Well, I think that President Obama has been a great moral leader on these issues, and has laid out an agenda that has been obstructed by the Republicans at every turn, so...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: ...So, what we need to be doing is not only reforming criminal justice -- I have talked about that at some length, including things like body cameras, but we also need to be following the recommendations of the commissioner that President Obama empanelled on policing. There is an agenda there that we need to be following up on.Similarly, we need to tackle mass incarceration, and this may be the only bi-partisan issue in the congress this year. We actually have people on both sides of the aisle who have reached the same conclusion, that we can not keep imprisoning more people than anybody else in the world.But, I believe that the debate, and the discussion has to go further, Anderson, because we've got to do more about the lives of these children. That's why I started off by saying we need to be committed to making it possible for every child to live up to his or her god given potential. That is...COOPER: ...Thank you, Senator...CLINTON: ...really hard to do if you don't have early childhood education...COOPER: Senator...CLINTON: ...if you don't have schools that are able to meet the needs of the people, or good housing, there's a long list...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: ...We need a new New Deal for communities of color...COOPER: Senator Webb?WEBB: I hope I can get that kind of time here. As a President of the United States, every life in this country matters. At the same time, I believe I can say to you, I have had a long history of working with the situation of African Americans.We're talking about criminal justice reform, I risked my political life raising the issue of criminal justice reform when I ran for the Senate in Virginia in 2006. I had democratic party political consultants telling me I was committing political suicide.We led that issue in the congress. We started a national debate on it. And it wasn't until then that the Republican Party started joining in.I also represented a so-called war criminal, an African American Marine who was wounded -- who was convicted of murder in Vietnam, for six years. He took his life three years into this. I cleared his name after -- after three years.COOPER: Thanks, sir.WEBB: And I put the African American soldier on the Mall. I made that recommendation and fought for it. So, if you want someone who is -- can stand up in front of you right now and say I have done the hard job, I have taken the risks, I am your person.COOPER: Senator Sanders, let's talk about income inequality. Wages and incomes are flat. You've argued that the gap between rich and poor is wider than at any time since the 1920s. We've had a Democratic president for seven years. What are you going to be able to do that President Obama didn't?SANDERS: Well, first of all, let's remember where we were when Bush left office. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month. And I know my Republican friends seem to have some amnesia on this issue, but the world's financial crisis was on -- the world's financial markets system was on the verge of collapse. That's where we were.Are we better off today than we were then? Absolutely. But the truth is that for the 40 years, the great middle class of this country has been disappearing. And in my view what we need to do is create millions of jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure; raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour; pay equity for women workers; and our disastrous trade policies, which have cost us millions of jobs; and make every public college and university in this country tuition free.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Secretary Clinton...(CROSSTALK)COOPER: I'll let you jump in a moment. Everybody will get in on this in a moment.Secretary Clinton, how would you address this issue? In all candor, you and your husband are part of the one percent. How can you credibly represent the views of the middle class?CLINTON: Well, you know, both Bill and I have been very blessed. Neither of us came from wealthy families and we've worked really hard our entire lives. And I want to make sure every single person in this country has the same opportunities that he and I have had, to make the most of their God-given potential and to have the chances that they should have in America for a good education, good job training, and then good jobs.I have a five point economic plan, because this inequality challenge we face, we have faced it at other points. It's absolutely right. It hasn't been this bad since the 1920s. But if you look at the Republicans versus the Democrats when it comes to economic policy, there is no comparison. The economy does better when you have a Democrat in the White House and that's why we need to have a Democrat in the White House in January 2017.COOPER: Governor O'Malley, (inaudible).O'MALLEY: Yes. Anderson, I want to associate myself with many of the items that the senator from Vermont mentioned, and I actually did them in our state. We raised the minimum wage, passed the living wage, invested more in infrastructure, went four years in a row without a penny's increase in college tuition.But there's another piece that Senator Sanders left out tonight, but he's been excellent about underscoring that. And that is that we need to separate the casino, speculative, mega-bank gambling that we have to insure with our money, from the commercial banking -- namely, reinstating Glass-Steagall.Secretary Clinton mentioned my support eight years ago. And Secretary, I was proud to support you eight years ago, but something happened in between, and that is, Anderson, a Wall Street crash that wiped out millions of jobs and millions of savings for families. And we are still just as vulnerable Paul Volcker says today.We need to reinstate Glass-Steagall and that's a huge difference on this stage among us as candidates.COOPER: Just for viewers at home who may not be reading up on this, Glass-Steagall is the Depression-era banking law repealed in 1999 that prevented commercial banks from engaging in investment banking and insurance activities.Secretary Clinton, he raises a fundamental difference on this stage. Senator Sanders wants to break up the big Wall Street banks. You don't. You say charge the banks more, continue to monitor them. Why is your plan better?CLINTON: Well, my plan is more comprehensive. And frankly, it's tougher because of course we have to deal with the problem that the banks are still too big to fail. We can never let the American taxpayer and middle class families ever have to bail out the kind of speculative behavior that we saw.But we also have to worry about some of the other players -- AIG, a big insurance company; Lehman Brothers, an investment bank. There's this whole area called ""shadow banking."" That's where the experts tell me the next potential problem could come from.CLINTON: So I'm with both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley in putting a lot of attention onto the banks. And the plan that I have put forward would actually empower regulators to break up big banks if we thought they posed a risk. But I want to make sure we're going to cover everybody, not what caused the problem last time, but what could cause it next time.(CROSSTALK)COOPER: Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton just said that her policy is tougher than yours.SANDERS: Well, that's not true.(LAUGHTER)COOPER: Why?SANDERS: Let us be clear that the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of Wall Street, where fraud is a business model, helped to destroy this economy and the lives of millions of people.(APPLAUSE)Check the record. In the 1990s -- and all due respect -- in the 1990s, when I had the Republican leadership and Wall Street spending billions of dollars in lobbying, when the Clinton administration, when Alan Greenspan said, ""what a great idea it would be to allow these huge banks to merge,"" Bernie Sanders fought them, and helped lead the opposition to deregulation.(APPLAUSE)Today, it is my view that when you have the three...COOPER: Senator...SANDERS: ...largest banks in America -- are much bigger than they were when we bailed them out for being too big to fail, we have got to break them up.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you have to be able to respond. He brought you up.CLINTON: Yeah.You know, I -- I respect the passion an intensity. I represented Wall Street, as a senator from New York, and I went to Wall Street in December of 2007 -- before the big crash that we had -- and I basically said, ""cut it out! Quit foreclosing on homes! Quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors.""I took on the Bush administration for the same thing. So I have thought deeply and long about what we're gonna do to do exactly what I think both the senator and the governor want, which is to rein in and stop this risk.And my plan would have the potential of actually sending the executives to jail. Nobody went to jail after $100 billion in fines were paid...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: ...and would give regulators the authority to go after the big banks.COOPER: Thank you. Thank you. Senator Sanders...CLINTON: But I'm telling you -- I will say it tonight. If only you look at the big banks, you may be missing the forest for the trees.(CROSSTALK)WEBB: Bernie, say my name so I can get into this.SANDERS: I will, just a second.WEBB: OK. Thank you.(LAUGHTER)SANDERS: I'll tell him.In my view, Secretary Clinton, you do not -- Congress does not regulate Wall Street. Wall Street regulates Congress.(APPLAUSE)And we have gotta break off these banks. Going to them...CLINTON: So...SANDERS: ...and saying, ""please, do the right thing""...CLINTON: ...no, that's not what...SANDERS: ...is kind of naive.CLINTON: ...that -- I think Dodd-Frank was a very...WEBB: Anderson, I need to jump in (inaudible).CLINTON: ...good start, and I think that we have to implement it. We have to prevent the Republicans from ripping it apart. We have to save the Consumer Financial Protection board, which is finally beginning to act to protect consumers.(APPLAUSE)We have work to do. You've got no argument from me. But I know, if we don't come in with a very tough and comprehensive approach, like the plan I'm recommending, we're gonna be behind instead of ahead...COOPER: Governor O'Malley? Where do you stand?CLINTON: ...on what the next crisis could be.O'MALLEY: Anderson, look, this is -- the big banks -- I mean, once we repealed Glass-Steagall back in the late 1999s (ph), the big banks, the six of them, went from controlling, what, the equivalent of 15 percent of our GDP to now 65 percent of our GDP.And -- (inaudible) right before this debate, Secretary Clinton's campaign put out a lot of reversals on positions on Keystone and many other things. But one of them that we still have a great difference on, Madam Secretary, is that you are not for Glass-Steagall.You are not for putting a firewall between this speculative, risky shadow banking behavior. I am, and the people of our country need a president who's on their side, willing to protect the Main Street economy from recklessness on Wall Street.We have to fulfill...COOPER: I have to let you respond.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, you know, everybody on this stage has changed a position or two. We've been around a cumulative quite some period of time.(LAUGHTER)You know, we know that if you are learning, you're gonna change your position. I never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone.But I have been on the forefront of dealing with climate change, starting in 2009, when President Obama and I crashed (ph) a meeting with the Chinese and got them to sign up to the first international agreement to combat climate change that they'd ever joined.So I'm...CLINTON: ...not taking a back seat to anybody on my values...COOPER: Thank...CLINTON: ...my principles and the results that I get.COOPER: Senator Sanders...(APPLAUSE)Senator Sanders, in 2008, congressional leaders were told, without the 2008 bailout, the U.S. was possibly days away from a complete meltdown. Despite that, you still voted against it.As president, would you stand by your principles if it risked the country's financial stability?SANDERS: Well, I remember that meeting very well. I remember it like it was yesterday. Hank Paulson, Bernanke came in, and they say, ""guys, the economy is going to collapse because Wall Street is going under. It's gonna take the economy with them.""And you know what I said to Hank Paulson? I said, ""Hank, your guys -- you come from Goldman Sachs. Your millionaire and billionaire friends caused this problem. How about your millionaire and billionaire friends paying for the bailout, not working families in this country?""So to answer your question, no, I would not have let the economy collapse. But it was wrong to ask the middle class to bail out Wall Street. And by the way, I want Wall Street now to help kids in this country go to college, public colleges and universities, free with a Wall Street speculation tax.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: We're going to talk about that in a minute.But, Senator Webb, I want to get you in. You have said neither party has the guts to take on Wall Street. Is the system rigged?WEBB: There is a reality that I think we all need to recognize with respect to the power of the financial sector.And let me just go back a minute and say that on this TARP program, I introduced a piece of legislation calling for a windfall profits tax on the executives of any of these companies that got more than $5 billion, that it was time for them, once they got their compensation and their bonus, to split the rest of the money they made with the nurses and the truck drivers and the soldiers who bailed them out. With respect to the financial sector, I mean, I know that my time has run out but in speaking of changing positions and the position on how this debate has occurred is kind of frustrating because unless somebody mentions my name I can't get into the discussion.COOPER: You agreed to these rules and you're wasting time. So if you would finish your answer, we'll move on.WEBB: All right. Well, I'm trying to set a mark here so maybe we can get into a little more later on. This hasn't been equal time.But if you want to look at what has happened, if we look at the facts in terms of how we're going to deal with this, since that crash, in the last 10 years, the amount of the world's capital economy that Wall Street manages has gone from 44 percent to 55 percent.That means the Wall Street money managers are not risking themselves as the same way the American people are when they're going to get their compensation. They're managing money from all over the world.We have to take that into consideration when we're looking at ways to regulate it.COOPER: Governor Chafee, you have attacked Secretary Clinton for being too close to Wall Street banks. In 1999 you voted for the very bill that made banks bigger.CHAFEE: The Glass-Steagall was my very first vote, I'd just arrived, my dad had died in office, I was appointed to the office, it was my very first vote.COOPER: Are you saying you didn't know what you were voting for?CHAFEE: I'd just arrived at the Senate. I think we'd get some takeovers, and that was one. It was my very first vote, and it was 92-5. It was the...COOPER: Well, with all due respect, Governor...CHAFEE: But let me just say...COOPER: ... what does that say about you that you're casting a vote for something you weren't really sure about?CHAFEE: I think you're being a little rough. I'd just arrived at the United States Senate. I'd been mayor of my city. My dad had died. I'd been appointed by the governor. It was the first vote and it was 90-5, because it was a conference report.But let me just say about income inequality. We've had a lot of talk over the last few minutes, hours, or tens of minutes, but no one is saying how we're going to fix it. And it all started with the Bush tax cuts that favored the wealthy.So let's go back to the tax code. And 0.6 percent of Americans are at the top echelon, over 464,000, 0.6 Americans. That's less than 1 percent. But they generate 30 percent of the revenue. And they're doing fine.At the Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas, candidate Lincoln Chafee tried to excuse his voting record on Glass-Steagall as his ""very first vote"" in Senate after his father died. (CNN)COOPER: Thank you, Governor.CHAFEE: So there's still a lot more money to be had from this top echelon. I'm saying let's have another tier and put that back into the tax bracket. And that will generate $42 billion.COOPER: I want to bring in Dana Bash.CHAFEE: And then we can help the middle class and hard-earning Americans -- hard-working Americans.COOPER: Dana?BASH: Thank you.CNN visited college campuses, along with Facebook. And not surprisingly college affordability was among the most pressing issue.Senator Sanders, you've mentioned a couple of times you do have a plan to make public colleges free for everyone. Secretary Clinton has criticized that in saying she's not in favor of making a college free for Donald Trump's kids.Do you think taxpayers should pick up the tab for wealthy children?SANDERS: Well, let me tell you, Donald Trump and his billionaire friends under my policies are going to pay a hell of a lot more in taxes today -- taxes in the future than they're paying today.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: But in terms of education, this is what I think. This is the year 2015. A college degree today, Dana, is the equivalent of what a high school degree was 50 years ago.And what we said 50 years ago and a hundred years ago is that every kid in this country should be able to get a high school education regardless of the income of their family. I think we have to say that is true for everybody going to college.I think we don't need a complicated system, which the secretary is talking about, the income goes down, the income goes down, if you're poor you have to work, and so forth and so on.I pay for my program, by the way, through a tax on Wall Street speculation, which will not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, it will substantially lower interest rates on college debt, a major crisis in this country.(APPLAUSE)BASH: And, Secretary Clinton, it's not just college tuition that Senator Sanders is talking about, expanding Social Security and giving all Americans Medicare. What's wrong with that?CLINTON: Well, let me address college affordability, because I have a plan that I think will really zero in on what the problems are. First, all the 40 million Americans who currently have student debt will be able to refinance their debt to a low interest rate. That will save thousands of dollars for people who are now struggling under this cumbersome, burdensome college debt.As a young student in Nevada said to me, the hardest thing about going to college should not be paying for it. So then we have to make it more affordable. How do we make it more affordable? My plan would enable anyone to go to a public college or university tuition free. You would not have to borrow money for tuition.But I do believe -- and maybe it's because I worked when I went through college; I worked when I went through law school -- I think it's important for everybody to have some part of getting this accomplished. That's why I call it a compact.BASH: Secretary Clinton...CLINTON: But, yes, I would like students to work 10 hours a week...BASH: Can you answer the...SANDERS: ... in order to make it possible for them to afford their education. And I want colleges to get their costs down. They are outrageously high in what they're charging.BASH: Secretary Clinton, the question was not just about tuition, though. It was about Senator Sanders' plan to expand Social Security, to make Medicare available to all Americans. Is that something that you would support? And if not, why not?CLINTON: Well, I fully support Social Security. And the most important fight we're going to have is defending it against continuing Republican efforts to privatize it.BASH: Do you want to expand it?CLINTON: I want to enhance the benefits for the poorest recipients of Social Security. We have a lot of women on Social Security, particularly widowed and single women who didn't make a lot of money during their careers, and they are impoverished, and they need more help from the Social Security system.And I will focus -- I will focus on helping those people who need it the most. And of course I'm going to defend Social Security. I'm going to look for ways to try to make sure it's solvent into the future. And we also need to talk about health care at some time, because we agree on the goals, we just disagree on the means.SANDERS: When the Republicans -- when the Republicans in the Congress and some Democrats were talking about cutting Social Security and benefits for disabled veterans, for the so-called chained CPI, I founded a caucus called the Defending Social Security Caucus.My view is that when you have millions of seniors in this country trying to get by -- and I don't know how they do on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year -- you don't cut Social Security, you expand it. And the way you expand it is by lifting the cap on taxable incomes so that you do away with the absurdity of a millionaire paying the same amount into the system as somebody making $118,000. You do that, Social Security is solvent until 2061 and you can expand benefits.(CROSSTALK)COOPER: Senator Sanders, I want to bring it over to Juan Carlos Lopez from CNN en Espanol. We're obviously in Nevada. It's had the highest percentage of undocumented immigrants of any state in the country as of last year. Juan Carlos?LOPEZ: Gracias, Anderson. Senator Sanders, in 2013, you voted for immigration reform. But in 2007, when Democrats controlled Congress and the Bush White House was onboard, you voted against it. Why should Latino voters trust you now when you left them at the altar at the moment when reform was very close?SANDERS: I didn't leave anybody at the altar. I voted against that piece of legislation because it had guest-worker provisions in it which the Southern Poverty Law Center talked about being semi-slavery. Guest workers are coming in, they're working under terrible conditions, but if they stand up for their rights, they're thrown out of the country. I was not the only progressive to vote against that legislation for that reason. Tom Harkin, a very good friend of Hillary Clinton's and mine, one of the leading labor advocates, also voted against that.LOPEZ: Tom Harkin isn't running for president. You are.SANDERS: I know that. But point being is that progressives did vote against that for that reason. My view right now -- and always has been -- is that when you have 11 million undocumented people in this country, we need comprehensive immigration reform, we need a path toward citizenship, we need to take people out of the shadows.O'MALLEY: And Juan Carlos -- Juan Carlos...LOPEZ: Secretary Clinton -- Secretary Clinton, Governor O'Malley wants to open up Obamacare to millions of undocumented immigrants and their children, including almost 90,000 people right here in Nevada. Do you?CLINTON: Well, first of all, I want to make sure every child gets health care. That's why I helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, and I want to support states that are expanding health care and including undocumented children and others.I want to open up the opportunity for immigrants to be able to buy in to the exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. I think to go beyond that, as I understand what Governor O'Malley has recommended, so that they would get the same subsidies.I think that is -- it raises so many issues. It would be very difficult to administer, it needs to be part of a comprehensive immigration reform, when we finally do get to it.LOPEZ: Governor O'Malley?O'MALLEY: Juan Carlos, I think what you've heard up here is some of the old thinking on immigration reform, and that's why it's gridlocked. We need to understand that our country is stronger in every generation by the arrival of new American immigrants. That is why I have put out a policy for comprehensive immigration reform, that is why I would go further than President Obama has on DACA, and DAPA.I mean, we are a nation of immigrants, we are made stronger by immigrants. Do you think for a second that simply because somebody's standing in a broken que on naturalization they're not going to go to the hospital, and that care isn't going to fall on to our insurance rates? I am for a generous, compassionate America that says we're all in this together. We need comprehensiveCOOPER: Senator Webb...O'MALLEY: ...immigration reform. It'll make wages go up in America $250 for every year...LOPEZ: Senator Webb, do you support the undocumented immigrants getting Obamacare?WEBB: I wouldn't have a problem with that. Let me start by saying my wife is an immigrant. She was a refugee, her family escaped from Vietnam on a boat-- her entire extended family, after the communists took over, when hundreds of thousands of people were out there and thousands of them were dying. Went to two refugee camps, she never spoke English in her home, and she ended, as I said, graduating from Cornell Law School. That's not only American dream, that's a value that we have with a good immigration system in place. No country has -- is a country without defining its borders. We need to resolve this issue. I actually introduced an amendment in the 2007 immigration bill...LOPEZ: ...Thank you, Senator.WEBB: ...Giving a pathway to citizenship to those people who had come here, and put down their roots, and met as a series of standards...COOPER: ...Thank you, Senator.WEBB: ...lost (ph) -- I introduced that in 2007 -- We need a comprehensive reform, and we need to be able to define our borders.COOPER: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: I want to follow up because I think underneath Juan Carlos' important questions, there is such a difference between everything you're hearing here on this stage, and what we hear from the Republicans.(APPLAUSE)O'MALLEY: Here. Here.(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Demonize hard-working immigrants who have insulted them. You know, I came to Las Vegas in, I think, May. Early may. Met with a group of DREAMers, I wish everybody in America could meet with this young people, to hear their stories, to know their incredible talent, their determination, and that's why I would go further...COOPER: ...Secretary...CLINTON: ...than even the executive orders that President Obama has signed when I'm president.(CROSS TALK)COOPER: Secretary Clinton, let me ask you. Two of your rivals from your left, Governor O'Malley, and Senator Sanders, want to provide instate college tuition to undocumented immigrants. Where do you stand on that?CLINTON: My plan would support any state that takes that position, and would work with those states and encourage more states to do the same thing.COOPER: So, on the record, you believe that undocumented immigrants should get instate college tuition.CLINTON: If their states agree, then we want more states to do the same thing.COOPER: Governor O'Malley?O'MALLEY: Anderson, we actually did this in my state of Maryland. We passed...(APPLAUSE)O'MALLEY: We passed a state version of the DREAM Act...(CHEERING)O'MALLEY: ...And a lot of the xenophobes, the immigrant haters like some that we've heard like, Donald Trump, that carnival barker in the Republican party...(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)O'MALLEY: Tried to mischaracterize it as free tuition for illegal immigrants. But, we took our case to the people when it was petitioned to referendum, and we won with 58 percent of the vote. The more our children learn, the more they will earn, and that's true of children who have yet to be naturalized...COOPER: ...Senator...O'MALLEY: ...but will become American citizens...COOPER: Senator Sanders, you talked about your record on the Veteran affairs committee. You served on that committee for the last eight years, including two years as its chairman while veterans died waiting for health care. You and Senator McCain ultimately addressed the issue with bi-partisan legislation. Why did it take 18 Inspector General reports, and a CNN investigation, and others, before you and your colleagues took action?SANDERS: Well, I was chairman for two years, and when I was chairman we did take action. What we did is pass a $15 billion dollar piece of legislation which brought in many, many new doctors, and nurses into the V.A. so that veterans in this country could get the health care when they needed it, and not be on long waiting lines.And, the other part of that legislation said that if a veteran is living more than 40 miles away from a V.A. facility, that veteran could get health care from the community health center, or the private sector. As a result of that legislation, we went further in than any time in recent history in improving health care for the men and women of this country who put their lives on the line to defend them.COOPER: Governor Chafee, you and Hillary Clinton both voted for the Patriot Act which created the NSA surveillance program. You've emphasized civil liberties, privacy during your campaign. Aren't these two things in conflict?CHAFEE: No, that was another 99 to one vote for the Patriot Act, and it was seen as at the time modernizing our ability to do what we've always done to tap phones which always required a warrant. And I voted for that.COOPER: Do you regret that vote?CHAFEE: No, no. As long as you're getting a warrant, I believe that under the Fourth Amendment, you should be able to do surveillance, but you need a warrant. That's what the Fourth Amendment says. And in the Patriot Act, section 215 started to get broadened too far. So I would be in favor of addressing and reforming section 215 of the Patriot Act.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, do you regret your vote on the Patriot Act?CLINTON: No, I don't. I think that it was necessary to make sure that we were able after 9/11 to put in place the security that we needed. And it is true that it did require that there be a process. What happened, however, is that the Bush administration began to chip away at that process. And I began to speak out about their use of warrantless surveillance and the other behavior that they engaged in.We always have to keep the balance of civil liberties, privacy and security. It's not easy in a democracy, but we have to keep it in mind.COOPER: Senator -- Senator Sanders, you're the only one on this stage who voted against the Patriot Act in 2001...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: It was 99 to one and I was maybe the one. I don't know.COOPER: ... and the reauthorization votes. Let me ask you, if elected, would you shut down the NSA surveillance program?SANDERS: I'm sorry?COOPER: Would you shut down the NSA surveillance program?SANDERS: Absolutely. Of course.COOPER: You would, point blank.SANDERS: Well, I would shut down -- make -- I'd shut down what exists right now is that virtually every telephone call in this country ends up in a file at the NSA. That is unacceptable to me. But it's not just government surveillance. I think the government is involved in our e-mails; is involved in our websites. Corporate America is doing it as well.If we are a free country, we have the right to be free. Yes, we have to defend ourselves against terrorism, but there are ways to do that without impinging on our constitutional rights and our privacy rights.O'MALLEY (?): Anderson, the NSA...COOPER: Governor Chafee, Edward Snowden, is he a traitor or a hero?CHAFEE: No, I would bring him home. The courts have ruled that what he did -- what he did was say the American...(CROSSTALK)COOPER: Bring him home, no jail time?CHAFEE: ... the American government was acting illegally. That's what the federal courts have said; what Snowden did showed that the American government was acting illegally for the Fourth Amendment. So I would bring him home.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, hero or traitor?CLINTON: He broke the laws of the United States. He could have been a whistleblower. He could have gotten all of the protections of being a whistleblower. He could have raised all the issues that he has raised. And I think there would have been a positive response to that.COOPER: Should he do jail time?ClINTON: In addition -- in addition, he stole very important information that has unfortunately fallen into a lot of the wrong hands. So I don't think he should be brought home without facing the music.COOPER: Governor O'Malley, Snowden?(APPLAUSE)O'MALLEY: Anderson, Snowden put a lot of Americans' lives at risk. Snowden broke the law. Whistleblowers do not run to Russia and try to get protection from Putin. If he really believes that, he should be back here.COOPER: Senator Sanders, Edward Snowden?SANDERS: I think Snowden played a very important role in educating the American people to the degree in which our civil liberties and our constitutional rights are being undermined.COOPER: Is he a hero?SANDERS: He did -- he did break the law, and I think there should be a penalty to that. But I think what he did in educating us should be taken into consideration before he is (inaudible).COOPER: Senator Webb, Edward Snowden?WEBB: I -- well, I -- I would leave his ultimate judgment to the legal system. Here's what I do believe. We have a serious problem in terms of the collection of personal information in this country. And one of the things that I did during the FISA bill in 2007, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, was introduce with Russ Feingold two amendments basically saying, ""We understand the realities of how you have to collect this broad information in the Internet age, but after a certain period of time, you need to destroy the personal information that you have if people have not been brought -- if criminal justice proceedings have not been brought against them.""We've got a vast data bank of information that is ripe for people with bad intentions to be able to use. And they need to be destroyed.COOPER: Another -- another question for each of you, starting with Governor Chafee.Name the one thing -- the one way that your administration would not be a third term of President Obama.CHAFEE: Certainly, ending the wars. We've got to stop these wars. You have to have a new dynamic, a new paradigm. We just spent a half-billion dollars arming and training soldiers, the rebel soldiers in Syria. They quickly join the other side. We bombed the...(CROSSTALK)COOPER: President Obama's generals right now are suggesting keeping troops in Afghanistan after the time he wanted them pulled out. Would you keep them there?CHAFEE: I'd like to finish my question -- my answer.And also we just bombed a hospital. We've had drone strikes that hit civilian weddings. So I would change how we -- our approach to the Middle East. We need a new paradigm in the Middle East.COOPER: Governor O'Malley, how would you be different than President Obama's administration?O'MALLEY: I would follow through on the promise that the American people thought we made as Democratic Party, to protect the Main Street economy from recklessness on Wall Street. I would push to separate out these too-big-to-jail, too-big-to-fail banks, and put in place Glass-Steagall, a modern Glass-Steagall that creates a firewall so that this wreckage of our economy can never happen again.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, how would you not be a third term of President Obama?CLINTON: Well, I think that's pretty obvious. I think being the first woman president would be quite a change from the presidents we've had up until this point, including President Obama.Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton says that becoming the nation's first female president would be ""quite a change."" She was asked how her presidency would differ from President Obama's. (CNN)COOPER: Is there a policy difference?CLINTON: Well, there's a lot that I would like to do to build on the successes of President Obama, but also, as I'm laying out, to go beyond. And that's in my economic plans, how I would deal with the prescription drug companies, how I would deal with college, how I would deal with a full range of issues that I've been talking about throughout this campaign to go further.COOPER: Senator Sanders?SANDERS: I have a lot of respect for president Obama. I have worked with him time and time again on many, many issues. But here's where I do disagree. I believe that the power of corporate America, the power of Wall Street, the power of the drug companies, the power of the corporate media is so great that the only way we really transform America and do the things that the middle class and working class desperately need is through a political revolution when millions of people begin to come together and stand up and say: Our government is going to work for all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Senator Webb, how would you not be a third term for Obama?WEBB: I got a great deal of admiration and affection for Senator Sanders, but I -- Bernie, I don't think the revolution's going to come. And I don't think the Congress is going to pay for a lot of this stuff. And if there would be a major difference between my administration and the Obama administration, it would be in the use of executive authority.I came up as a committee counsel in the Congress, used to put dozens of bills through the House floor every year as a committee counsel on the Veterans Committee. I have a very strong feeling about how our federal system works and how we need to lead and energize the congressional process instead of allowing these divisions to continue to paralyze what we're doing. So I would lead -- working with both parties in the Congress and working through them in the traditional way that our Constitution sets (ph).COOPER: Senator Sanders, he cited you. You don't hear a lot of Democratic presidential candidates talking about revolution. What do you mean?SANDERS: What I mean is that we need to have one of the larger voter turnouts in the world, not one of the lowest. We need to raise public consciousness. We need the American people to know what's going on in Washington in a way that today they do not know.(APPLAUSE)And when people come together in a way that does not exist now and are prepared to take on the big money interest, then we could bring the kind of change we need.O'MALLEY: Anderson, I actually have talked about a revolution. What we need is a green energy revolution. We need to move America to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way.COOPER: And we want to -- and we're going to talk more about climate change and environmental issues coming up. Some of the candidates have tried marijuana, as have pretty much -- probably everybody in this room.(LAUGHTER)Others have not. Does that influence -- does it influence their views on legalization? Find out that and others ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)COOPER: And welcome back to this CNN Democratic presidential debate. It has been quite a night so far. We are in the final block of this debate. All the candidates are back, which I'm very happy to see.(LAUGHTER)COOPER: It's a long story. Let's continue, shall we?Secretary Clinton, welcome back.(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: You know, it does take me a little longer. That's all I can say.COOPER: That's right. Secretary Clinton, Governor O'Malley says the presidency is not a crown to be passed back and forth between two royal families. This year has been the year of the outsider in politics, just ask Bernie Sanders. Why should Democrats embrace an insider like yourself?CLINTON: Well, I can't think of anything more of an outsider than electing the first woman president, but I'm not just running because I would be the first woman president.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I'm running because I have a lifetime of experience in getting results and fighting for people, fighting for kids, for women, for families, fighting to even the odds. And I know what it takes to get things done. I know how to find common ground and I know how to stand my ground. And I think we're going to need both of those in Washington to get anything that we're talking about up here accomplished.So I'm very happy that I have both the commitment of a lifetime and the experience of a lifetime to bring together to offer the American people.Democratic presidental candidate Hillary Clinton says there is a lot she would do ""to build on the successes of President Obama,"" but says her proposed plans go beyond his current politics. (CNN)COOPER: Governor O'Malley, do you want to tell Secretary Clinton why she shouldn't get the crown?O'MALLEY: Well, actually, you know, we had this conversation. And I will share with you that I've traveled all around the country, Anderson, and there's two phrases I keep hearing again and again and again. And they're the phrases ""new leadership"" and ""getting things done.""We cannot be this dissatisfied with our gridlocked national politics and an economy where 70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago, and think that a resort to old names is going to move us forward.I respect what Secretary Clinton and her husband have done for our country. But our country needs new leadership to move forward.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you have to be able to respond, if you want.CLINTON: Well, I would not ask anyone to vote for me based on my last name. I would ask them to listen to what I'm proposing, look at what I've accomplished in the Senate, as secretary of of state, and then draw your own conclusion.I certainly am not campaigning to become president because my last name is Clinton. I'm campaigning because I think I have the right combination of what the country needs, at this point, and I think I can take the fight to the Republicans, because we cannot afford a Republican to succeed Barack Obama as president of the United States.COOPER: (inaudible).(APPLAUSE)Senator Sanders, does she have the right stuff?SANDERS: I think -- I think that there is profound frustration all over this country with establishment politics. I am the only candidate running for president who is not a billionaire, who has raised substantial sums of money, and I do not have a super PAC.(APPLAUSE)I am not raising money from millionaires and billionaires, and in fact, tonight, in terms of what a political revolution is about, there are 4,000 house parties -- 100,000 people in this country -- watching this debate tonight who want real change in this country.COOPER: we've got -- we -- a lot of questions we've got about climate change, and we're gonna go to Don Lemon. Don?LEMON: All right. This one is for Martin O'Malley. Anderson, Governor O'Malley, this is from Anna Bettis from Tempe, Arizona. Here it is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)QUESTION: As a young person, I'm very concerned about climate change and how it will affect my future. As a presidential candidate, what will you do to address climate change?(END VIDEO CLIP)LEMON: So, Governor O'Malley, please tell Anna how you would protect the environment better than all the other candidates up on that stage.O'MALLEY: Yeah.Anna, I have put forward a plan -- and I'm the only candidate, I believe, in either party to do this -- to move America forward to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050.We did not land a man on the moon with an all-of-the-above strategy. It was an intentional engineering challenge, and we solved it as a nation. And our nation must solve this one.So I put forward the plan that would extend the investor tax credits for solar and for wind. If you go across Iowa, you see that 30 percent of their energy now comes from wind. We're here in Las Vegas, one of the most sustainable cities in America, doing important things in terms of green building, architecture and design.We can get there as a nation, but it's going to require presidential leadership. And as president, I intend to sign as my very first order in office the -- an order that moves us as a nation and dedicates our resources to solving this problem and moving us to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050.COOPER: Governor...O'MALLEY: We can do it.COOPER: ...Governor O'Malley, thank you very much.(APPLAUSE)Senator Webb, you have a very different view than just about anybody else on this stage, and unlike a lot of Democrats. You're pro-coal, you're pro-offshore drilling, you're pro-Keystone pipeline. Are -- again, are you -- the question is, are you out of step with the Democratic party?WEBB: Well, the -- the question really is how are we going to solve energy problems here and in the global environment if you really want to address climate change?And when I was in the Senate, I was an all-of-the-above energy voter. We introduced legislation to bring in alternate energy as well as nuclear power. I'm a strong proponent of nuclear power. It is safe, it is clean. And really, we are not going to solve climate change simply with the laws here.We've done a good job in this country since 1970. If you look at China and India, they're the greatest polluters in the world. Fifteen out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are in one of those two countries. We need to solve this in a global way. It's a global problem and I have been very strong on -- on doing that. The -- the agreements -- the so-called agreements that we have had with China are illusory in terms of the immediate requirements of the -- of the Chinese government itself.So let's solve this problem in an international way, and then we really will have a -- a way to address climate change.COOPER: Senator Sanders, are you tougher on -- on climate change than Secretary Clinton?SANDERS: Well, I will tell you this. I believe -- and Pope Francis made this point. This is a moral issue. The scientists are telling us that we need to move extremely boldly.I am proud that, along with Senator Barbara Boxer, a few years ago, we introduced the first piece of climate change legislation which called for a tax on carbon.And let me also tell you that nothing is gonna happen unless we are prepared to deal with campaign finance reform, because the fossil fuel industry is funding the Republican Party, which denies the reality of climate change...(APPLAUSE)...and certainly is not prepared to go forward aggressively.This is a moral issue. We have got to be extremely aggressive in working with China, India, Russia.COOPER: Senator -- thank you, Senator.SANDERS: The planet -- the future of the planet is at stake.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, I want you to be able to respond, then I'm gonna go to (ph) (inaudible).CLINTON: Well, that -- that's exactly what I've been doing. When we met in Copenhagen in 2009 and, literally, President Obama and I were hunting for the Chinese, going throughout this huge convention center, because we knew we had to get them to agree to something. Because there will be no effective efforts against climate change unless China and India join with the rest of the world.They told us they'd left for the airport; we found out they were having a secret meeting. We marched up, we broke in, we said, ""We've been looking all over for you. Let's sit down and talk about what we need to do."" And we did come up with the first international agreement that China has signed.Thanks to President Obama's leadership, it's now gone much further.COOPER: Thank you.CLINTON: And I do think that the bilateral agreement that President Obama made with the Chinese was significant. Now, it needs to go further, and there will be an international meeting at the end of this year, and we must get verifiable commitments to fight climate change from every country gathered there.COOPER: Dana Bash?BASH: Secretary Clinton, you now support mandated paid family leave.CLINTON: Mm-hmm.BASH: Carly Fiorina, the first female CEO of a Fortune 50 company, argues, if the government requires paid leave, it will force small businesses to, quote, ""hire fewer people and create fewer jobs."" What do you say not only to Carly Fiorina, but also a small-business owner out there who says, you know, I like this idea, but I just can't afford it?CLINTON: Well, I'm surprised she says that, because California has had a paid leave program for a number of years. And it's...BASH: It's on the federal level.CLINTON: Well, but all -- well, on a state level, a state as big as many countries in the world. And it has not had the ill effects that the Republicans are always saying it will have. And I think this is -- this is typical Republican scare tactics. We can design a system and pay for it that does not put the burden on small businesses.I remember as a young mother, you know, having a baby wake up who was sick and I'm supposed to be in court, because I was practicing law. I know what it's like. And I think we need to recognize the incredible challenges that so many parents face, particularly working moms.I see my good friend, Senator Gillibrand, in the front row. She's been a champion of this. We need to get a consensus through this campaign, which is why I'm talking about it everywhere I go, and we need to join the rest of the advanced world in having it.BASH: But Secretary -- Secretary Clinton, even many people who agree with you might say, look, this is very hard to do, especially in today's day and age. There are so many people who say, ""Really? Another government program? Is that what you're proposing? And at the expense of taxpayer money?""CLINTON: Well, look, you know, when people say that -- it's always the Republicans or their sympathizers who say, ""You can't have paid leave, you can't provide health care."" They don't mind having big government to interfere with a woman's right to choose and to try to take down Planned Parenthood. They're fine with big government when it comes to that. I'm sick of it.(APPLAUSE)You know, we can do these things.(APPLAUSE)We should not be paralyzed -- we should not be paralyzed by the Republicans and their constant refrain, ""big government this, big government that,"" that except for what they want to impose on the American people. I know we can afford it, because we're going to make the wealthy pay for it. That is the way to get it done.COOPER: Thank you. Senator Sanders?SANDERS: Yeah, Dana, here's the point: Every other major country on Earth, every one, including some small countries, say that when a mother has a baby, she should stay home with that baby. We are the only major country. That is an international embarrassment that we do not provide family -- paid family and medical leave.(APPLAUSE)Second of all, the secretary is right. Republicans tell us we can't do anything except give tax breaks to billionaires and cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. That's not what the American people want.COOPER: Governor O'Malley?O'MALLEY: Anderson, in our state, we actually expanded family leave. And I have to agree with Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders. Look, the genius of our nation is that we find ways in every generation to include more of our people more fully in the economic life of our country, and we need to do that for our families, and especially so that women aren't penalized in having to drop out of the workforce. My wife, Katie, is here with our four kids. And, man, that was a juggle when we had little kids and -- and keeping jobs and moving forwards. We would be a stronger nation economically if we had paid family leave.COOPER: Governor, thank you. The issue now, particularly in this state, is recreational marijuana. I want to go to Juan Carlos Lopez.LOPEZ: Thank you, Anderson.Senator Sanders, right here in Nevada, there will be a measure to legalize recreational marijuana on the 2016 ballot. You've said you smoked marijuana twice; it didn't quite work for you. If you were a Nevada resident, how would you vote?SANDERS: I suspect I would vote yes.(APPLAUSE)And I would vote yes because I am seeing in this country too many lives being destroyed for non-violent offenses. We have a criminal justice system that lets CEOs on Wall Street walk away, and yet we are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana. I think we have to think through this war on drugs...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: ...which has done an enormous amount of damage. We need to rethink our criminal justice system, we we've got a lot of work to do in that area.O'MALLEY: Juan Carlos?(APPLAUSE)LOPEZ: Secretary Clinton, you told Christiane Amanpour you didn't smoke pot when you were young, and you're not going to start now.(LAUGHTER)LOPEZ: When asked about legalizing recreational marijuana, you told her let's wait and see how it plays out in Colorado and Washington. It's been more than a year since you've said that. Are you ready to take a position tonight?CLINTON: No. I think that we have the opportunity through the states that are pursuing recreational marijuana to find out a lot more than we know today. I do support the use of medical marijuana, and I think even there we need to do a lot more research so that we know exactly how we're going to help people for whom medical marijuana provides relief.So, I think we're just at the beginning, but I agree completely with the idea that we have got to stop imprisoning people who use marijuana. Therefore, we need more states, cities, and the federal government to begin to address this so that we don't have this terrible result that Senator Sanders was talking about where we have a huge population in our prisons for nonviolent, low-level offenses that are primarily due to marijuana.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, thank you. I want to go to Don Lemon with another Facebook question.LEMON: Alright, Anderson. This is for Senator Sanders, OK? This is from Carrie (ph) Kang (ph) from Manassas, Virginia, would like would like to ask the Senator, ""President Obama has had a difficult time getting Republicans to compromise on just about every agenda. How will you approach this going forward, and will it be any different?""Senator?SANDERS: The Republican party, since I've been in the Senate, and since President Obama has been in office, has played a terrible, terrible role of being total obstructionists. Every effort that he has made, that some of us have made, they have said no, no, no.Now, in my view, the only way we can take on the right wing republicans who are, by the way, I hope will not continue to control the Senate and the House when one of us elected President...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: ...But the only way we can get things done is by having millions of people coming together. If we want free tuition at public colleges and universities, millions of young people are going to have to demand it, and give the Republicans an offer they can't refuse.If we want to raise the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour, workers are going to have to come together and look the Republicans in the eye, and say, ""We know what's going on. You vote against us, you are out of your job.""(APPLAUSE)COOPER: We're going to hear from all the candidates coming up. We're going to take a short break. More from the candidates in a moment.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)COOPER: And welcome back to the final round of the CNN Democratic presidential debate.This is a question to each of you. Each of you, by the way, are going to have closing statements to make. Each of you will have 90 seconds. But a final question to each of you. If you can, just try to -- 15 seconds if you can.Governor Chafee, Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said, ""I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."" You've all made a few people upset over your political careers. Which enemy are you most proud of?(LAUGHTER)CHAFEE: I guess the coal lobby. I've worked hard for climate change and I want to work with the coal lobby. But in my time in the Senate, tried to bring them to the table so that we could address carbon dioxide. I'm proud to be at odds with the coal lobby.COOPER: Governor O'Malley?O'MALLEY: The National Rifle Association.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, in addition to the NRA, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the Iranians.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Senator Sanders?SANDERS: As someone who has taken on probably every special interest that there is in Washington, I would lump Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry at the top of my life of people who do not like me.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Senator Webb?WEBB: I'd have to say the enemy soldier that threw the grenade that wounded me, but he's not around right now to talk to.During the first Democratic debate on CNN, candidates were asked to name an enemy made during their politics careers. Former Virginia senator Jim Webb chose a soldier whom he killed in Vietnam. (CNN)COOPER: All right. Time for closing statements. Each of you will have 90 seconds.Governor Chafee, let's begin with you.CHAFEE: Thank you, Anderson. Thank you, CNN. And thank you, Facebook, for sponsoring this debate.America has many challenges confronting us -- ending the perpetual wars, addressing climate change, addressing income inequality, funding education, funding infrastructure, funding healthcare, helping black Americans, helping Native Americans. We have many challenges. Who is best able to confront these challenges?I've served in government at many levels. I know what it's like to solve problems at the local level because I did it as mayor. I know how to get legislation passed through Congress because I did it as a senator. I know how to turn around a state because I did as governor of Rhode Island.But what I'm most proud of is that in 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals. I have high ethical standards. And what I'm most proud of is my judgment, particularly in the Iraq war vote. There was a lot of pressure -- political pressure, public pressure. But I did my homework and I did not believe that the evidence was there that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. And we live now with the consequences.CHAFEE: So that kind of judgment is what we want in a president going forward. And I'm running for president to end the wars. I want to be the peacemaker. I am a proven peacemaker. Please go to Chafee 2016 to learn more about me. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Governor Chafee, thank you very much. Senator Webb, your final statement for 90 seconds.WEBB: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, it's been a pleasure to be with you tonight. You've heard a lot of promises up here; you've heard a lot of rhetoric. They all seem to happen during campaigns, and then once the election's over, people start from scratch again and try to get things done.One of the things I can promise you, if you look at my record, in and out of government, is that I've always been willing to take on a complicated, something unpopular issues, and work them through, the complex issues, and work them through in order to have the solution.We did it with criminal justice reform. We've had a lot of discussion here about criminal justice reform. We did it in other ways. We need a national political strategy for our economy, for our social policy, for social justice, and, by the way, for how you run and manage the most complex bureaucracy in the world, which is the federal government.I know how to lead. I did it in Vietnam, I did it in the Pentagon, I did it in the Senate, and if you will help me overcome this cavalcade of -- of financial irregularities and money that is poisoning our political process, I am ready to do that for you in the White House.COOPER: Senator Webb, thank you very much.Governor O'Malley, you have 90 seconds.O'MALLEY: Anderson, thank you.I am very, very grateful to have been able to be on this stage with this distinguished group of candidates tonight. And what you heard tonight, Anderson, was a very, very -- and all of you watching at home -- was a very, very different debate than from the sort of debate you heard from the two presidential Republican debates.(APPLAUSE)On this stage -- on this stage, you didn't hear anyone denigrate women, you didn't hear anyone make racist comments about new American immigrants, you didn't hear anyone speak ill of another American because of their religious belief.What you heard instead on this stage tonight was an honest search for the answers that will move our country forward, to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050, to take the actions that we have always taken as Americans so that we can actually attack injustice in our country, employ more of our people, rebuild our cities and towns, educate our children at higher and better levels, and include more of our people in the economic, social, and political life of our country.I truly believe that we are standing on the threshold of a new era of American progress. Unless you've become discouraged about our gridlock in Congress, talk to our young people under 30, because you'll never find among them people that want to bash immigrants or people that want to deny rights to gay couples.(APPLAUSE)That tells me we are moving to a more connected, generous, and compassionate place, and we need to speak to the goodness within our country.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Governor O'Malley, thank you very much.Senator Sanders, final, closing thoughts, 90 seconds.SANDERS: This is a great country, but we have many, many serious problems. We should not be the country that has the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country and more wealth and income inequality than any other country.We should not be the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all of our people as a right of citizenship and we should not be the only major country that does not provide medical and -- and parental leave -- family and parental leave to all of our families.Now, at the end of our day, here is the truth that very few candidates will say, is that nobody up here, certainly no Republican, can address the major crises facing our country unless millions of people begin to stand up to the billionaire class that has so much power over our economy and our political life.Jim Webb is right: Money is pouring in to this campaign through super PACs. We are doing it the old-fashioned way: 650,000 individual contributions. And if people want to help us out, BernieSanders.com. We are averaging $30 bucks apiece. We would appreciate your help.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Thank you very much, Anderson. And thanks to all the viewers who tuned in tonight.I think what you did see is that, in this debate, we tried to deal with some of the very tough issues facing our country. That's in stark contrast to the Republicans who are currently running for president.What you have to ask yourself is: Who amongst us has the vision for actually making the changes that are going to improve the lives of the American people? Who has the tenacity and the ability and the proven track record of getting that done?Now, I revere my late mother, and she gave me a lot of good advice. But one of the best pieces of advice she gave me was, you know, the issue is not whether or not you get knocked down. It's whether you get back up.America's been knocked down. That Great Recession, 9 million people lost their jobs, 5 million lost their homes, $13 trillion in wealth disappeared. And although we've made progress, we're standing but not running the way America needs to.My mission as president will be to raise incomes for hard-working middle-class families and to make sure that we get back to the basic bargain I was raised with: If you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead.Please join me in this campaign. Please come and make it clear that America's best days are still ahead. Thank you very much.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Well, that does it for this Democratic presidential debate. On behalf of everyone at CNN, we want to thank the candidates, our debate partners at Facebook, the Wynn Resort, and the Democratic National Committee. Thanks also to Dana Bash, Juan Carlos Lopez, and Don Lemon. We'll be back in Las Vegas December 15th, when CNN hosts our next Republican presidential debate. That will be moderated by my colleague, Wolf Blitzer.1 of 5"

HISD reports a graduation rate of 80%. First, the calculation to say that Lee’s graduation rate is 45% (272/608) does NOT take into consideration the 178 students who left and have documented enrollment in other Texas public schools and the 101 students who joined Lee during the 4 years of the cohort. So it is inaccurate. Secondly, if you remove the 178 from the cohort (who enrolled in other Texas public schools) and add the 101 (who joined during the cohort years), our my calculation (if you don’t account for other leavers) gets a graduation rate of 51% (272/531), and conversely, a dropout rate of 49%. This too is fallacious, especially since 35 students remained for a 5th year of enrollment. Thirdly, the 186 other leavers should indeed be removed from the cohort since these are students with documents/affidavits in their files supporting that they: enrolled in schools in other states, began home schooling, enrolled in Texas private schools, graduated outside of Texas, or returned to their home country, all of which are state recognized leaver codes and not considered dropouts. When you remove these students and 5 students with coding errors that could not be tracked, the graduation rate becomes 80% (272/340). Lastly, if you were to inappropriately count the 69 students who went back to their home country as dropouts and keep them in the cohort, this would make the graduation rate 67% (272/409).

Missouri state Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, D-University City, wrote during a morning Facebook exchange, referring to Republican President Donald Trump.She quickly deleted her post, but not quickly enough. By midafternoon, the political verdicts of her own party were rolling in:U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.: I condemn it. Its outrageous. And she should resign.U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-St. Louis: (C)alling for the assassination of the President is a federal crime. ... (She is) an embarrassment to our state. She should resign immediately.Missouri Democratic Party Chair Stephen Webber: The ... Party will absolutely not tolerate calls for the assassination of the President. I believe she should resign.Missouri Senate Democratic Caucus leader Sen. Gina Walsh: (She) should be ashamed of herself for adding her voice to this toxic environment.Republican Gov. Eric Greitens said in a statement: We can have differences in our country, but no one should encourage political violence. The senator should resign.Lt. Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, and state Auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democrat, also called for Chappelle-Nadals resignation.In an interview, Chappelle-Nadal acknowledged she wrote the offending line on her personal Facebook page in response to another commenter before deleting it.I didnt mean what I put up. Absolutely not. I was very frustrated. Things have got to change, Chappelle-Nadal told the Post-Dispatch. It was in response to the concerns that I am hearing from residents of St. Louis. I have deleted it, and it should have been deleted, but there is something way more important that we should be talking about.She added later: I am not resigning ... What I said was wrong, but I am not going to stop talking about what led to that, which is the frustration and anger that many people across America are feeling right now.Chappelle-Nadal said her comment stemmed from frustration over the events in Charlottesville over the weekend, in which a white supremacist protester allegedly rammed his car into a group of counterprotesters, killing a 32-year-old woman. +1 Trumps reaction to the tragedy, which included the assertion that both sides of the protests were to blame for the violence, has drawn criticism across the political spectrum.There are people who are afraid of white supremacists in the aftermath of Charlottesville, she said. There are people who are having nightmares. There are people who are afraid of going out in the streets. Its worse than even Ferguson.According to a screenshot of the now-deleted conversation obtained by the Post-Dispatch, another commenter named Christopher Gagne was writing about a cousin of his who he said was on Trumps Secret Service detail.But, what I posted earlier, I truly believe will happen, sooner ... not later, he wrote.In a subsequent interview with the Post-Dispatch, Gagne said that wasnt a reference to assassination, but to his earlier-stated belief that Vice President Mike Pence will use the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to have Trump removed from office.Damn, Gagne then wrote, now Ill probably get a visit from the Secret Service. He followed that comment with smdh, an abbreviation for shaking my damn head.Chappelle-Nadal responded: No. I will. I hope Trump is assassinated!The U.S. Secret Services St. Louis field office is looking into this, the office confirmed Thursday.Kristina Schmidt, special agent in charge, told the Post-Dispatch that hypothetically in such investigations, agents try to determine intent, to determine if there was a violation of federal law. If there is, then we refer it to the U.S. attorney.Our primary goal is to determine if there is intent and meaning behind it, Schmidt said.Richard Callahan, former U.S. attorney in St. Louis, said that generally in cases involving such threats, we try to distinguish between stupid and (actual) intent. He said the bottom line is the question of whether the person was serious about making the threatened action happen.Another factor, he said, is whether its a person of influence. You look at the persons station in life, whether they might have influence over others.In addition to partywide condemnation of Chappelle-Nadals post, state Rep. Joshua Peters, D-St. Louis, issued a formal request Thursday to the Missouri Senate committee that deals with member ethics asking for Chappelle-Nadals removal from office, calling her an embarrassment nationally for the Missouri General Assembly.The furious responses from Chappelle-Nadals own party might at least partly reflect her history of internal political strife as an outspoken critic of people on both sides of the aisle.First elected to the House in 2004, she served three terms before winning a four-way primary for the Senates 14th District in 2010.In January 2015, she filed a proposal in the Senate seeking the ouster of former Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, for his actions in relation to the August 2014 death of a black teenager in Ferguson by a white police officer. In her proposal, she said Nixon seems only to acknowledge the existence of the African-American community on or about election day.The measure went nowhere. But her attacks on Nixon never dimmed. In a tweet at the time of the protests in Ferguson, Chappelle-Nadal wrote: You dont know s*** because you never communicate. F* you, governor!Shes also tried to exert political payback against her foes. She spent nearly $20,000 on negative ads against Rep. Joe Adams, whom she had defeated in her race for the Senate five years previously.She got into a fight with Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, at a Lil Wayne concert at Scottrade Center in 2011 over legislation regarding local control of the city police department.Last year, she unsuccessfully challenged Clay, the St. Louis-based congressman, in the Democratic primary.During the most recent legislative session, Chappelle-Nadal focused her efforts on a controversial buyout program for homeowners in the Spanish Village neighborhood of Bridgeton who have been impacted by pollution in the nearby Westlake Landfill.Initially, she wanted her colleagues to approve a $12 million program and threatened to shut down the Senate with a filibuster if it didnt move forward. She backed off when the Senate endorsed a $1 million pilot program. But the House didnt agree and she left the Capitol in May with nothing.Kurt Erickson and Joe Holleman of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.#ndn-video-player-3.ndn_embedded .ndn_floatContainer { margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; }

['Fake news']	http://now8news.com/	http://now8news.com/united-airlines-flight-attendant-slaps-crying-baby/	2017/04/18	Posted By: Now8NewsDuring a flight from New York City to Chicago, violence erupted after a flight attendant assaulted a 7 month-old baby boy. This comes just hours after a man was dragged off of an overbooked United Airlines flight when he refused to get off the plane. He was pulled out of his seat and thrown into the aisle as seen on a video released on Monday.The baby, whose name has not been released, was left with a welt mark across his face due to the assault. Eyewitnesses say the little boy was screaming for about 38 minutes straight and the parents were asked by the flight attendant several times to “quiet that annoying ass baby down.”After the 4th attempt to get the parents to comply, the flight attendant erupted into a rage grabbing the baby from the mother’s arms and slapping him in the face. It took several passengers to subdue the United Airlines employee.The flight attendant was restrained in the back of the plane until the Pilot could make an emergency landing in Missouri. United Airlines released a statement saying the employee acted in a way that does not represent their company and has been fired.The little boy is said to be in stable condition with no life-threatening injuries. The parents say they are reaching out to an attorney, refusing to give any further statements. 
http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2017/aug/18/andrew-cuomo/yes-one-three-us-adults-have-criminal-record/	"""70 million Americans have a criminal record — that’s one in three adults."""	half-true	['Criminal Justice', 'Jobs']	https://www.linkedin.com/	https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/employers-often-unwilling-hire-someone-convicted-crime-andrew-cuomo	2017/08/18	Main content starts below.Photo: Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesEmployers are often unwilling to hire someone convicted of a crime. That's a problem — and it needs to change.Published onSign in to follow this author56th Governor of New York StateBy Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and Jostein Solheim , CEO of Ben & Jerry’sEmployers can often be hesitant to hire someone with a criminal conviction. Unsubstantiated rumors of increased violence in the workplace, theft, or incompetence often stand in the way of giving someone with a record a chance. Yet employers that do hire formerly incarcerated individuals end up reaping the benefits: loyal employees with higher retention rates, tax benefits, and increased economic mobility for their staff.70 million Americans have a criminal record—that’s 1 in 3 adults. There are currently 2.3 million people behind bars in this country, 95 percent of whom will reenter our communities. 640,000 people are released from prison each year, creating a huge untapped workforce available to fill jobs. Yet, in New York State, 53 percent of people on parole have yet to find a job. Employers are often uncomfortable hiring people who have been convicted of a crime—one study found that, in New York City, a criminal record reduced the likelihood of a callback or job offer by nearly 50 percent.This is a problem. Joblessness is the number one predictor of recidivism—the less likely it is for a formerly incarcerated person to find a job, the more likely it is that they end up back in prison, with all the costs associated with incarceration, including a price tag of $60,000 per inmate per year in New York. These barriers to reentry have a negative trickle effect not only on the lives of these individuals, preventing them from providing for themselves and their families, but on society as a whole. Studies have shown that excluding formerly incarcerated individuals from the workforce results in a GDP loss of $78-87 billion thanks to lost tax revenue, and that if states can reduce recidivism rates by just 10 percent, they could save an average of $635 million annually.That’s why my administration has launched the Work for Success Pledge —an online pledge in which companies, like Ben and Jerry’s or VICE Media, whose VICE Apprenticeship Program hires and trains formerly incarcerated people for production, editorial and creative jobs at the company, commit to consider hiring qualified candidates with criminal convictions. New York is the first state in the nation to develop such a pledge. So far, 80 companies have signed on and shown their commitment to hiring those with a criminal conviction—but we need more to pledge their support! It just makes good business sense.Companies like Ben & Jerry’s recognize that hiring formerly incarcerated individuals and working with suppliers that do the same is important for our business, our culture, and our bottom line. Studies have shown that those with a criminal conviction can often make the best employees—they are retained at higher rates than those with no criminal record, saving companies costs associated with hiring and training, which can be as much as $4,000 per employee. Additionally, companies that hire people with criminal convictions are eligible for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC), which provides a maximum tax credit of $2,400 per employee.Formerly incarcerated individuals are often the most motivated at work. A study of army enlistees found that enlistees with felony records were 33 percent more likely to be promoted to sergeant than those with no conviction history, a testament to their dedication and motivation.Ben & Jerry’s is incredibly proud of our long relationship with the Greyston Bakery in Yonkers. It was Ben who heard about the bakery and came up with one of our most successful flavors, Chocolate Fudge Brownie, specifically to allow our company to work with and expand the impact of the baker which, through its open hiring process, has helped thousands of returning citizens and their families rebuild their lives and their dignity. It is in part because of our long relationship with the Greyston Bakery that we’ve made changes to our hiring and recruiting process so that people are judged by their skill and qualifications, not the mistakes of the past. There is no doubt, with 1 in 3 Americans having been convicted of a crime, if we were to use criminal conviction as screen for recruiting, we would be leaving very qualified candidates out of our process. That’s just a bad business decision.Across New York, the Cuomo administration has long been dedicated to providing employment for those with criminal convictions. In 2012, we launched the Work for Success Program , which matches qualified and appropriately trained job applicants with criminal convictions to open job listings. In the last five years, we have placed more than 18,000 people in jobs, and each new company that signs on to our Work for Success Pledge also commits to listing job openings with the program.In 2015, the Council on Community Reentry and Reintegration took further steps to ensure equity in hiring by setting uniform guidelines that evaluate qualified applicants for state occupational licenses and adopting “fair chance hiring” for New York State agencies, meaning agencies will not ask about a job applicant’s criminal convictions until and unless the agency has interviewed the candidate and is interested in hiring him or her. As a result of Reentry Council efforts in 2016, New York is also the first in the nation to prohibit insurance companies from denying insurance coverage to businesses that hire people with criminal convictions.These are small steps that can make a huge difference. Together, by signing the Work for Success Pledge , businesses have a real opportunity to not only provide a helping hand to those who have been cut off from opportunities, but to also improve our bottom line. New York State is dedicated to creating a true “state of opportunity” for everyone.FollowFollowingUnfollowAndrew Cuomo

And if you'd like to join in the annotating, make sure you have a Genius account so you can get startedLAUER: Good evening, everyone, from the Carrier Intrepid here in New York City. In just a couple of short months, Americans are going to vote in a critical election. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are vying not only to become president of the United States, but one of them will become the leader of the most potent military force the world has ever seen.I'm standing in a place where I can actually see the site of the World Trade Center. Fifteen years ago this week, the worst terror attack on American soil changed the world and launched this nation into years of war. Tonight's forum is a great opportunity for these nominees to talk about national security and the complex global issues that face our nation. And they'll get to tell you why they are ready for the role of commander-in-chief.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KENNEDY: It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States.JOHNSON: I have today ordered to Vietnam the Air Mobile Division.REAGAN: Air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against the headquarters and military assets that support Moammar Gadhafi.GEORGE H.W. BUSH: No president can easily commit our sons and daughters to war.BILL CLINTON: We can and will succeed because our mission is clear and our troops are strong.GEORGE W. BUSH: I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.OBAMA: I can report to the American people the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaida.(END VIDEO CLIP)ANNOUNCER: The Commander-in-Chief Forum, live from the Carrier Intrepid in New York. Here now is Matt Lauer.LAUER: Good evening, everyone. The decisions a commander-in- chief makes can have a profound and lasting impact on all Americans, but none more so than the brave men and women who serve, fight, and die for our country. What makes tonight's forum unique, some of the questions will be asked by U.S. military veterans who are in our audience. The presidential nominees will appear back-to-back tonight. After a coin toss yesterday won by Mr. Trump, he chose to go second. So that means we begin tonight with the Democratic nominee for president. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Hillary Clinton.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Matt, how are you? Good to see you. Thank you. Hi. How are you?LAUER: Good to have you.(APPLAUSE)Nice to see you. Good evening.CLINTON: Thank you very much.

Melina Mara/The Washington PostBuy PhotoWait 1 second to continue.LAUER: Let me -- thank you very much, I'm happy to be here. Let me ask you something ahead of time that I'll ask Mr. Trump in a half an hour. To the best of your ability tonight, can we talk about your qualities and your qualifications to be commander-in-chief and not use this as an opportunity to attack Mr. Trump, all right? And I'll ask him the exact same thing.CLINTON: I think that's an exactly right way to proceed.LAUER: OK.CLINTON: This is a very important decision for our country. And each of us should be presenting our experience, our expertise, and our plans to protect and defend the United States and our allies around the world.LAUER: What is the most important characteristic that a commander-in-chief can possess?CLINTON: Steadiness. An absolute rock steadiness, and mixed with strength to be able to make the hard decisions. Because I've had the unique experience of watching and working with several presidents. And these are not easy decisions. If they were, they wouldn't get to the president in the first place.And when you're sitting in the Situation Room, as I have on numerous occasions, particularly with respect to determining whether to recommend the raid against bin Laden, what you want in a president, a commander-in-chief, is someone who listens, who evaluates what is being told to him or her, who is able to sort out the very difficult options being presented...LAUER: You're talking about judgment.CLINTON: ... and then makes the decision. Makes the decision, that's right.LAUER: So judgment is a key.CLINTON: Temperament and judgment, yes.LAUER: The word ""judgment"" has been used a lot around you, Secretary Clinton, over the last year-and-a-half, and in particular concerning your use of your personal e-mail and server to communicate while you were secretary of state. You've said it's a mistake.CLINTON: Mm-hmm.LAUER: You said you made not the best choice. You were communicating on highly sensitive topics. Why wasn't it more than a mistake? Why wasn't it disqualifying, if you want to be commander-in- chief?CLINTON: Well, Matt, first of all, as I have said repeatedly, it was a mistake to have a personal account. I would certainly not do it again. I make no excuses for it. It was something that should not have been done.But the real question is the handling of classified material, which is I think what the implication of your question was. And for all the viewers watching you tonight, I have a lot of experience dealing with classified material, starting when I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee going into the four years as secretary of state. Classified material has a header which says ""top secret,"" ""secret,"" ""confidential."" Nothing -- and I will repeat this, and this is verified in the report by the Department of Justice -- none of the e-mails sent or received by me had such a header.LAUER: Were some of the e-mails sent or received by you referring to our drone program, our covert drone program?CLINTON: Yes, because -- of course, there were no discussions of any of the covert actions in process being determined about whether or not to go forward. But every part of our government had to deal with questions, and the secretary of state's office was first and foremost. So there are ways of talking about the drone program...(CROSSTALK)LAUER: And you said you thought your communications on that were fairly routine?CLINTON: Well, let me say, the FBI just released their report about their investigation, they discussed drone matters in the unclassified section of their report.LAUER: But Director Comey also said this after reviewing all the information. He said there is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation.CLINTON: Well, Matt, I just respectfully point to the hundreds of experienced foreign policy experts, diplomats, defense officials who were communicating information on the unclassified system because it was necessary to answer questions and to be able publicly to go as far as we could, which was not acknowledging the program.But I would be in Pakistan, as I was on several occasions. There might very well have been a strike. I would be asked in a public setting, in an interview, about it. It was known to have happened. We had to have an answer that did not move into classified area. And I think we handled that appropriately.LAUER: You mentioned you're in Pakistan. Some of the e-mails you sent and received happened while you were overseas. And Director Comey also said that while they have no proof, we assessed that it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal e-mail accounts.CLINTON: Matt, there is no evidence. Of course anything is possible. But what is factual is the State Department system was hacked. Most of the government systems are way behind the curve. We've had hacking repeatedly, even in the White House. There is no evidence my system was hacked.LAUER: Let us bring in Hallie Jackson of NBC News who's been covering this campaign. She's getting questions from our veterans. Hallie, who are you with?JACKSON: Hi, Matt. I'm with Lieutenant Jon Lester (ph), who will stand with me here. He began his military career by enlisting in the Air Force and then switched over to the Navy before he retired, where he flew P-3 Orions in Desert Storm and in Desert Shield. He's a Republican, and he has this question for you, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Thank you.QUESTION: Secretary Clinton, thank you very much for coming tonight. As a naval flight officer, I held a top secret sensitive compartmentalized information clearance. And that provided me access to materials and information highly sensitive to our warfighting capabilities. Had I communicated this information not following prescribed protocols, I would have been prosecuted and imprisoned.Secretary Clinton, how can you expect those such as myself who were and are entrusted with America's most sensitive information to have any confidence in your leadership as president when you clearly corrupted our national security?CLINTON: Well, I appreciate your concern and also your experience. But let me try to make the distinctions that I think are important for me to answer your question.First, as I said to Matt, you know and I know classified material is designated. It is marked. There is a header so that there is no dispute at all that what is being communicated to or from someone who has that access is marked classified.And what we have here is the use of an unclassified system by hundreds of people in our government to send information that was not marked, there were no headers, there was no statement, top secret, secret, or confidential.I communicated about classified material on a wholly separate system. I took it very seriously. When I traveled, I went into one of those little tents that I'm sure you've seen around the world because we didn't want there to be any potential for someone to have embedded a camera to try to see whatever it is that I was seeing that was designated, marked, and headed as classified.LAUER: Let us...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: So I did exactly what I should have done and I take it very seriously, always have, always will.LAUER: Sir, thank you. Thank you very much for your question. Secretary Clinton, let's talk about your vote in favor of the war in Iraq. You've since said it was a mistake.CLINTON: Mm-hmm.LAUER: Obviously, it was not something you said you would do again. I asked before for people to raise their hand if you served in Iraq. Can you do it again? How do you think these people feel when the person running to be their commander-in-chief says her vote to go to war in Iraq was a mistake?CLINTON: Look, I think that the decision to go to war in Iraq was a mistake. And I have said that my voting to give President Bush that authority was, from my perspective, my mistake. I also believe that it is imperative that we learn from the mistakes, like after- action reports are supposed to do, and so we must learn what led us down that path so that it never happens again. I think I'm in the best possible position to be able to understand that and prevent it.But I will say this. I'm asking to be judged on the totality of my record, what I've done for our veterans as first lady, as senator, what I've done for Gold Star Families, working with them to increase the death benefit from $12,000 to $100,000, working with Republicans, like Lindsey Graham, to get TRICARE for our National Guard members who didn't have health care unless they were deployed, working to provide more support for the care of our veterans, those who are wounded, working with the Fisher family, now into the third generation of caring for our fallen heroes, working with John McCain to raise money for Brooke Medical Center's Intrepid Center to take care of those who are coming back with profound injuries, working on TBI and PTSD and so much more, working with groups to end veteran suicide, like TAPS. So, yes...LAUER: I'm going to get on to that subject in a second.CLINTON: There was -- there was a mistake. Now, my opponent was for the war in Iraq. He says he wasn't. You can go back and look at the record. He supported it. He told Howard Stern he supported it. So he supported it before it happened, he supported it as it was happening, and he is on record as supporting it after it happened. I have taken responsibility for my decision.LAUER: Let me go to another...CLINTON: He refuses to take responsibility for his support. That is a judgment issue.LAUER: Let me go to another question. Hallie?JACKSON: (OFF-MIKE) who served in the Air Force for nearly a decade, where she was an intelligence specialist, specializing in countering violent extremism. Like you, Secretary Clinton, she's a Democrat and she has this question for you.QUESTION: Thank you. Secretary Clinton, to your point, you have had an extensive record with military intervention. How do you respond to progressives like myself who worry and have concerns that your hawkish foreign policy will continue? And what is your plan to end wasteful war campaigns in which our peers, servicewomen and men, continue to be killed and wounded?CLINTON: Well, I assume you're talking about Iraq, because of my vote, and you probably are talking about Libya, because of the role that I played in the administration's decision about whether to take on Gadhafi.CLINTON: But before I get to that, let me say very clearly: I view force as a last resort, not a first choice. I will do everything in my power to make sure that our men and women in the military are fully prepared for any challenge that they may have to face on our behalf.But I will also be as careful as I can in making the most significant decisions any president and commander-in-chief can make about sending our men and women into harm's way.With respect to Libya, again, there's no difference between my opponent and myself. He's on record extensively supporting intervention in Libya, when Gadhafi was threatening to massacre his population. I put together a coalition that included NATO, included the Arab League, and we were able to save lives. We did not lose a single American in that action.And I think taking that action was the right decision. Not taking it, and permitting there to be an ongoing civil war in Libya, would have been as dangerous and threatening as what we are now seeing in Syria.LAUER: I'm going to jump in. Thank you very much for your question. Let me ask you about the Iran nuclear deal. It was signed under Secretary Kerry; it was begun under you. You started those talks.CLINTON: Right, I did.LAUER: You have said you expect the Iranians to cheat, you think they'll buy time, and perhaps stay along their course to building a nuclear weapon. If they cheat, Secretary Clinton, will you have any course of action other than a military course of action? Would you enter into negotiations with again (ph)? Would you go back to economic sanctions knowing they cheated and are then closer to a nuclear weapon?CLINTON: Matt, look, let me put this in context, because this is one of the most important strategic questions we face. When I became secretary of state, the Iranians were on a fast track to acquiring the material necessary to get a nuclear weapon. That had happened the prior eight years. They mastered the nuclear fuel cycle, they built covert facilities, they stocked them with centrifuges, and they were moving forward.What was our decision? Our decision was to try to put together an international coalition that included Russia and China to exert the kind of pressure through sanctions that the United States alone could not do.LAUER: Right, but you've said that you think they're going to cheat...CLINTON: Now, wait, let me -- look, this is an important issue. I know we're on TV and we don't have a lot of time.LAUER: I want to get to a lot of questions.CLINTON: I will talk quickly. But I want people to understand this. So, yes, I put together the coalition. We imposed the sanctions. We got them to the negotiating table. And after I left, we got the agreement. That agreement put a lid on their nuclear weapons program and imposed intrusive inspections. I have said we are going to enforce it to the letter.LAUER: Do you think they're playing us?CLINTON: On the nuclear issue, no. I think we have enough insight into what they're doing to be able to say we have to distrust but verify. What I am focused on is all the other malicious activities of the Iranians -- ballistic missiles, support for terrorists, being involved in Syria, Yemen, and other places, supporting Hezbollah, Hamas.But here's the difference, Matt. I would rather as president be dealing with Iran on all of those issues without having to worry as much about their racing for a nuclear weapon. So we have made the world safer; we just have to make sure it's enforced.LAUER: Hallie?JACKSON: I'm with Kenneth Anderson (ph). He's one of our undecided voters here. He considers himself an independent. He earned the rank of sergeant in the Marine Corps, where he was an Arabic translator during three tours in Iraq. Kenneth, you have a question for Secretary Clinton.QUESTION: Yes, Secretary Clinton, last October you said that surveys of veterans show that they're overall satisfied with their treatment and that the problems with the V.A. aren't as widespread as they're made out to be. So do you think the problems with the V.A. have been made to seem worse than they really are?CLINTON: Look, I was outraged by the stories that came out about the V.A. And I have been very clear about the necessity for doing whatever is required to move the V.A. into the 21st century, to provide the kind of treatment options that our veterans today desperately need and deserve. And that's what I will do as president.But I will not let the V.A. be privatized. And I do think there is an agenda out there, supported by my opponent, to do just that. I think that would be very disastrous for our military veterans. So I'm going to do everything I can -- I'm going to have a meeting every week in the Oval Office. We're going to bring the V.A. people, we're going to bring the DOD people, because we've got to have a better fit between getting mustered out and getting into the V.A. system, sometimes -- and you probably know this, Sergeant -- I've met so many vets who get mustered out, who leave the service, they can't find their records from DOD, and those records never make it to the V.A. They feel like they're living in a funhouse. They have to go over the same things over and over.We're living in a technological world. You cannot tell me we can't do a better job getting that information. And so I'm going to focus on this. I'm going to work with everybody. I'm going to make them work together.LAUER: And I'm going to jump in.CLINTON: And we're going to fix the problems in the V.A.LAUER: Sergeant, thank you very much for your question. Let's talk about veterans and suicide.CLINTON: Yes, let's, please.LAUER: It's an alarming, alarming story. The population of veterans has a rate of suicide far above the general population.CLINTON: Twenty -- twenty suicides a day.LAUER: What are you going to do to stop it?CLINTON: Well, this month is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month. And I've spent a lot of time with family members, survivors, who've lost a loved one after he or she came home, sometimes suffering from PTSD or TBI or sexual assault, being handed bags of opioids, not being given an appropriate treatment to help that particular person, which is something, to go back to the sergeant's question, we have to change.So I rolled out my mental health agenda last week, and I have a whole section devoted to veterans' mental health. And we've got to remove the stigma. We've got to help people currently serving not to feel that if they report their sense of unease, their depression, that somehow it's going to be a mark against them.We have to do more about addiction, not only drugs, but also alcohol. So I have put forth a really robust agenda, working with a lot of the VSOs and other groups, like TAPS, who have been thinking about this and trying to figure out what we're going to do to help our veterans re-enter civilian life and live full, productive lives.LAUER: Hallie?JACKSON: I'm with Ernie Young. Come on up here with me, a former Army captain, who led troops during tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan. He's an independent voter. And you have a question for the secretary.QUESTION: Secretary Clinton, as an Army veteran, a commander-in- chief's to empathize with servicemembers and their families is important to me. The ability to truly understand implications and consequences of your decisions, actions, or inactions. How will you determine when and where to deploy troops directly into harm's way, especially to combat ISIS?LAUER: As briefly as you can.CLINTON: We have to defeat ISIS. That is my highest counterterrorism goal. And we've got to do it with air power. We've got to do it with much more support for the Arabs and the Kurds who will fight on the ground against ISIS. We have to squeeze them by continuing to support the Iraqi military. They've taken back Ramadi, Fallujah. They've got to hold them. They've got to now get into Mosul.We're going to work to make sure that they have the support -- they have special forces, as you know, they have enablers, they have surveillance, intelligence, reconnaissance help.They are not going to get ground troops. We are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again. And we're not putting ground troops into Syria. We're going to defeat ISIS without committing American ground troops. So those are the kinds of decisions we have to make on a case-by-case basis.And, remember, when I became secretary of state, we had 200,000 troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. And I'm very grateful that we have brought home the vast majority of those. We have a residual force, as you know, in Afghanistan. We have built up several thousands of the folks that I've talked about who are assisting in the fight against ISIS.But it is in our national security interest to defeat ISIS. And I intend to make that happen.LAUER: Thank you very much for your question.CLINTON: And as part of it, we're going after Baghdadi, the leader, because it will help us focus our attention, just like going after bin Laden helped us focus our attention...LAUER: Secretary...CLINTON: ... in the fight against Al Qaida in the Afghanistan- Pakistan theater.LAUER: Secretary Clinton, I am fast running out of time. I want to get to one of the concerns just about everybody in this country, and that is terror attacks on our soil.CLINTON: Right.LAUER: Either directed by ISIS or inspired by ISIS. Would your message as the next president of the United States or potential next president be to Americans that we simply are living in the reality that those attacks will happen? And can you guarantee people that after four years of a Clinton presidency, they will be safer on the streets of San Bernardino or Boston than they are today?CLINTON: Well, Matt, I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure that that's the result. I'm not going to, you know, promise something that I think most thinking Americans know is going to be a huge challenge, and here's why. We've got to have an intelligence surge. We've got to get a lot more cooperation out of Europe, out of the Middle East. We have to do a better job of not only collecting and analyzing the intelligence we do have, but distributing it much more quickly down the ladder to state and local law enforcement.We also have to do a better job combating ISIS online, where they recruit, where they radicalize. And I don't think we're doing as much as we can. We need to work with Silicon Valley. We need to work with our experts in our government. We have got to disrupt, we have got to take them on in the arena of ideas that, unfortunately, pollute and capture the minds of vulnerable people. So we need to wage this war against ISIS from the air, on the ground, and online, in cyberspace.And here at home, for goodness's sakes, we have to finally pass a law prohibiting people on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in the United States of America. So we've got work to do. I know we can do that work. I'm meeting with a group of terror experts, counterterrorism experts.But I want to just say one additional thing.LAUER: I've got 30 seconds left.CLINTON: Matt Olsen, the former director of the National Center on Counterterrorism, has a great article out today saying the last thing we need to do is to play into the hands of ISIS. Going after American Muslims, defaming a Gold Star family, the family of Captain Khan, making it more difficult for us to have a coalition with Muslim majority nations...LAUER: And we tried to have an agreement...CLINTON: ... that is not going to help us to succeed in defeating ISIS and protecting our American homeland.LAUER: Secretary Hillary Clinton, thank you very much.CLINTON: Thank you. Thank you all.(APPLAUSE)Thank you so much. Too short a time.LAUER: I know. We're going to take a break. We're going to have much more with her competitor, Donald Trump, right after this. You're watching NBC News special, the Commander-in-Chief Forum.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)LAUER: We welcome you back now to this NBC News special, the Commander-in-Chief Forum. Tonight we're speaking with the two major party presidential nominees to find out where they stand on the critical issues. Now, please welcome the Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)LAUER: Good to see you.TRUMP: Thank you, Matt.LAUER: Thank you very much for joining us.TRUMP: Thank you.LAUER: You heard me say to Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, and it didn't completely work out toward the end there, as much as possible I'd like you to tell our veterans and our people at home why you are prepared for the role of commander-in-chief and try to keep the attacks to a minimum. We've had a year of that and maybe 60 more days of it.TRUMP: To a minimum, absolutely.LAUER: OK, perfect. To a minimum. I guess that's a question of definition.TRUMP: I guess.LAUER: Any time you interview a president, sitting or past president, they will tell you that the most daunting...TRUMP: Was I supposed to answer this question?LAUER: No, no, no, I mean just keep the attacks to a minimum. Any time you talk to a president, they'll tell you the most daunting part of the job is the role of commander-in-chief.TRUMP: Right. LAUER: What have you experienced in your personal life or your professional life that you believe prepares you to make the decisions that a commander-in-chief has to make?TRUMP: Well, I've built a great company. I've been all over the world. I've dealt with foreign countries. I've done very well, as an example, tremendously well dealing with China and dealing with so many of the countries that are just ripping this country. They are just taking advantage of us like nobody's ever seen before.And I've had great experience dealing on an international basis. I look today and I see Russian planes circling our planes. They're taunting us. I see in Iran, I see the boats taunting our ships, our destroyers, and I think...(CROSSTALK)LAUER: But what have you done in your life that prepares you to send men and women of the United States into harm's way?TRUMP: Well, I think the main thing is I have great judgment. I have good judgment. I know what's going on. I've called so many of the shots. And I happened to hear Hillary Clinton say that I was not against the war in Iraq. I was totally against the war in Iraq. From a -- you can look at Esquire magazine from '04. You can look at before that.And I was against the war in Iraq because I said it's going to totally destabilize the Middle East, which it has. It has absolutely been a disastrous war, and by the way, perhaps almost as bad was the way Barack Obama got out. That was a disaster.LAUER: People talk about you and commander-in-chief, and not just Secretary Clinton, but some of your Republican opponents in the primary season, and they wonder about your temperament. They say, does Donald Trump have the temperament to be commander-in-chief?You said something recently that I found interesting. You admitted that sometimes in the heat of a debate or when you're talking about a lot of issues you say things that you later regret. So can we afford that with a commander-in-chief -- to have a commander-in-chief who says things that he later regrets?TRUMP: Well, when you say regret, yeah, sure, I regret. But in the meantime, I beat 16 people and here I am. So, you know, to a certain extent there is a regret. I would have liked to have done it in a nicer manner. But I had 16 very talented people that I had to go through. And that was a lot of people.LAUER: But when you say...TRUMP: That was a record, Matt. That was a record in the history of Republican politics. I was able to get more votes than anybody ever has gotten in the history of Republican politics.LAUER: But when you say inflammatory things... (CROSSTALK)LAUER: ... in a presidential campaign, it's different than saying them when you're commander-in-chief. If you say things you regret...TRUMP: I agree with you.LAUER: ... when you're commander-in-chief, you can spark a conflict, you can destabilize a region, you can put American lives at risk. Can we afford to take that risk with you?TRUMP: Well, I think absolutely. I think if you saw what happened in Mexico the other day, where I went there, I had great relationships, everything else. I let them know where the United States stands. I mean, we've been badly hurt by Mexico, both on the border and with taking all of our jobs or a big percentage of our jobs.And if you look at what happened, look at the aftermath today where the people that arranged the trip in Mexico have been forced out of government. That's how well we did.LAUER: Back in August...TRUMP: And that's how well we're going to have to do, Matt.LAUER: Back in August, when you admitted that you regret some of the things you said, you also said this. ""I can promise you this: I will always tell you the truth.""TRUMP: It's true.LAUER: So let me read some of the things you've said. ""I know more about ISIS than the generals do. Believe me."" Was that the truth?TRUMP: Well, the generals under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have not been successful. ISIS...LAUER: Do you know more about ISIS than they do?TRUMP: I think under the leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the generals have been reduced to rubble. They have been reduced to a point where it's embarrassing for our country. You have a force of 30,000 or so people. Nobody really knows. But probably 30,000 people. And I can just see the great -- as an example- General George Patton spinning in his grave as ISIS we can't beat. We had the greatest...(CROSSTALK)LAUER: Yeah, you've said if we had MacArthur today or if we had Patton today, we would not have ISIS, that the rise of these military commanders that we have today, they come up the chain of command, and by the time they get to the top, they're too politically correct. And we know that's not a compliment coming from you. Have you lost faith in the military commanders?TRUMP: I have great faith in the military. I have great faith in certain of the commanders, certainly. But I have no faith in Hillary Clinton or the leadership. You look at what's happened. And, you know, when she comes in and starts saying, oh, I would have done this, I would have -- she's been there for 30 years. I mean, we need change, Matt. We have to have it, and we have to have it fast.LAUER: Let's go to Hallie Jackson in our crowd. Hallie?JACKSON: I'm with Phillip Clay (ph), who was a public affairs officer in the Marine Corps. He spent a year in Anbar province in Iraq. He left the military with the rank of captain, service that inspired him to write a book. He's a Democrat, and he has this question for you, Mr. Trump.QUESTION: Mr. Trump, over the past 15 years, a lot of U.S. troops have bled and died securing towns and provinces from Iraq to Afghanistan, only to have insurgent groups like ISIS spring back the moment we leave. Now, you've claimed to have a secret plan to defeat ISIS. But you're hardly the first politician to promise a quick victory and a speedy homecoming. So assuming we do defeat ISIS, what next? What is your plan for the region to ensure that a group like them doesn't just come back?TRUMP: Sure. I mean, part of the problem that we've had is we go in, we defeat somebody, and then we don't know what we're doing after that. We lose it, like as an example, you look at Iraq, what happened, how badly that was handled. And then when President Obama took over, likewise, it was a disaster. It was actually somewhat stable. I don't think could ever be very stable to where we should have never gone into in the first place.But he came in. He said when we go out -- and he took everybody out. And really, ISIS was formed. This was a terrible decision. And frankly, we never even got a shot. And if you really look at the aftermath of Iraq, Iran is going to be taking over Iraq. They've been doing it. And it's not a pretty picture.The -- and I think you know -- because you've been watching me I think for a long time -- I've always said, shouldn't be there, but if we're going to get out, take the oil. If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS, because ISIS formed with the power and the wealth of that oil.LAUER: How were we going to take the oil? How were we going to do that?TRUMP: Just we would leave a certain group behind and you would take various sections where they have the oil. They have -- people don't know this about Iraq, but they have among the largest oil reserves in the world, in the entire world.And we're the only ones, we go in, we spend $3 trillion, we lose thousands and thousands of lives, and then, Matt, what happens is, we get nothing. You know, it used to be to the victor belong the spoils. Now, there was no victor there, believe me. There was no victor. But I always said: Take the oil.One of the benefits we would have had if we took the oil is ISIS would not have been able to take oil and use that oil...LAUER: Let me stay on ISIS...TRUMP: ... to fuel themselves.LAUER: Let me stay on ISIS. When we've met in the past and we've talked, you say things like I'm going to bomb the expletive out of them very quickly. And when people like me press you for details like that gentleman just said on what your plan is, you very often say, I'm not going to give you the details because I want to be unpredictable.TRUMP: Absolutely. The word is unpredictable.LAUER: But yesterday, you actually told us a little bit about your plan in your speech. You said this. Quote, ""We're going to convene my top generals and they will have 30 days to submit a plan for soundly and quickly defeating ISIS."" So is the plan you've been hiding this whole time asking someone else for their plan?TRUMP: No. But when I do come up with a plan that I like and that perhaps agrees with mine, or maybe doesn't -- I may love what the generals come back with. I will convene...LAUER: But you have your own plan?TRUMP: I have a plan. But I want to be -- I don't want to -- look. I have a very substantial chance of winning. Make America great again. We're going to make America great again. I have a substantial chance of winning. If I win, I don't want to broadcast to the enemy exactly what my plan is.LAUER: But you're going to...TRUMP: And let me tell you, if I like maybe a combination of my plan and the generals' plan, or the generals' plan, if I like their plan, Matt, I'm not going to call you up and say, ""Matt, we have a great plan."" This is what Obama does. ""We're going to leave Iraq on a certain day.""LAUER: But you're going to convene a panel of generals, and you've already said you know more about ISIS than those generals do.TRUMP: Well, they'll probably be different generals, to be honest with you. I mean, I'm looking at the generals, today, you probably saw, I have a piece of paper here, I could show it, 88 generals and admirals endorsed me today.(CROSSTALK)LAUER: It's a numbers game. Hillary Clinton claims more numbers.TRUMP: Well, it's not really -- it's not -- yeah, numbers. People that have been losing for us for a long period of time. I mean, the fact is, we have had the worst and you could even say the dumbest foreign policy. Our results are so bad. We would have been better off had we never, ever spent $2 in that part of the world.LAUER: You recently -- you recently received two intelligence briefings.TRUMP: Yes, I did.LAUER: Did anything in that briefing, without going into specifics, shock or alarm you?TRUMP: Yes. Very much so.LAUER: Did you learn new things in that briefing?TRUMP: First of all, I have great respect for the people that gave us the briefings. We -- they were terrific people. They were experts on Iraq and Iran and different parts of -- and Russia. But, yes, there was one thing that shocked me. And it just seems to me that what they said President Obama and Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, who is another total disaster, did exactly the opposite.LAUER: Did you learn anything in that briefing -- again, not going into specifics -- that makes you reconsider some of the things you say you can accomplish, like defeating ISIS quickly?TRUMP: No, I didn't learn anything from that standpoint. What I did learn is that our leadership, Barack Obama, did not follow what our experts and our truly -- when they call it intelligence, it's there for a reason -- what our experts said to do. LAUER: Hallie?TRUMP: And I was very, very surprised. In almost every instance. And I could tell you. I have pretty good with the body language. I could tell they were not happy. Our leaders did not follow what they were recommending.LAUER: Hallie?JACKSON: I'm with former Army Captain Sue Fulton, who was a member of the First West Point class to include women. She served as a signal corps officer in Germany.(APPLAUSE)She's a Democrat, and she has this question for you, Mr. Trump.QUESTION: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Hi, thank you very much.QUESTION: Thank you. Do you believe that an undocumented person who serves -- who wants to serve in the U.S. armed forces deserves to stay in this country legally?TRUMP: I think that when you serve in the armed forces, that's a very special situation, and I could see myself working that out, absolutely.LAUER: So she's saying has already served in the armed forces or wants to serve, plans to serve?QUESTION: Plans to serve. Plans to serve in the armed forces. As you know, under DACA, we already have people who are undocumented who are serving.TRUMP: I think military is a very special thing. If they plan on serving, if they get in, I would absolutely hold those people -- now, we have to be very careful. We have to vet very carefully. Everybody would agree with that. But the answer is, it would be a very special circumstance, yes. Thank you.LAUER: Thank you very much for your question. Hallie, you have another one?JACKSON: I do. Alex Gronkowski (ph) was an Army staff sergeant assigned in special operations. He was stationed at Fort Bragg and was deployed to Afghanistan and other places across the Middle East. He has not decided who he will vote for yet in November. And you have a question for Mr. Trump.QUESTION: I do. Mr. Trump, as you know, tensions between the United States and Russia have been at the highest level since the Cold War. In your first 120 days of presidency, how would you de-escalate the tensions? And more importantly, what steps would you take to bring Mr. Putin and the Russian government back to negotiating table? TRUMP: I think I would have a very good relationship with many foreign leaders. I think it's very sad, when you look at Barack Obama, as an example, lands Air Force One in China, and they don't want to put out stairs to get off the plane. And he has to use the stairs that mechanics use to get up and down to fix the plane. They wouldn't give him stairs.I think it's very sad, when he lands in Saudi Arabia, and he lands in Cuba, and there aren't high officials to even greet him. This is the first time in the history -- the storied history of Air Force One.I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Putin. And I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Russia.As I said, take a look today. Take a look at what happened with their fighter jets circling one of our aircraft in a very dangerous manner. Somebody said less than 10 feet away. This is hostility.And I saw, just two or three days ago, they looked like they were not exactly getting along, but I looked at President Obama and Putin staring at each other. These were not two people that were getting along.And, you know, the beautiful part of getting along, Russia wants to defeat ISIS as badly as we do. If we had a relationship with Russia, wouldn't it be wonderful if we could work on it together and knock the hell out of ISIS? Wouldn't that be a wonderful thing?LAUER: Let me ask you about some of the things you've said about Vladimir Putin. You said, I will tell you, in terms of leadership, he's getting an A, our president is not doing so well. And when referring to a comment that Putin made about you, I think he called you a brilliant leader, you said it's always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his country and beyond.TRUMP: Well, he does have an 82 percent approval rating, according to the different pollsters, who, by the way, some of them are based right here. Look, look...LAUER: He's also a guy who annexed Crimea, invaded Ukraine, supports Assad in Syria, supports Iran, is trying to undermine our influence in key regions of the world, and according to our intelligence community, probably is the main suspect for the hacking of the DNC computers...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Well, nobody knows that for a fact. But do you want me to start naming some of the things that President Obama does at the same time?LAUER: But do you want to be complimented by that former KGB officer? TRUMP: Well, I think when he calls me brilliant, I'll take the compliment, OK? The fact is, look, it's not going to get him anywhere. I'm a negotiator. We're going to take back our country. You look at what's happening to our country, you look at the depleted military. You look at the fact that we've lost our jobs. We're losing our jobs like we're a bunch of babies. We're going to take back our country, Matt. The fact that he calls me brilliant or whatever he calls me is going to have zero impact.LAUER: But the fact that you say you can get along with him, do you think the day...TRUMP: I think I'd be able to get along with him.LAUER: Do you think the day that you become president of the United States, he's going to change his mind on some of these key issues?TRUMP: Possibly. It's possible. I don't know, Matt. It's possible. And it's not going to have any impact. If he says great things about me, I'm going to say great things about him. I've already said, he is really very much of a leader. I mean, you can say, oh, isn't that a terrible thing -- the man has very strong control over a country.Now, it's a very different system, and I don't happen to like the system. But certainly, in that system, he's been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader. We have a divided country. We have a country where you have Hillary Clinton with her e-mails that nobody's ever seen where she deletes 33,000 e-mails, and that's after getting a subpoena from Congress. If you do that in private business, you get thrown in jail.LAUER: Hallie?JACKSON: Steve Korea (ph), here with me, was in the Army Reserves and spent 10 months in Iraq right at the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He is a Republican and has this question for you.QUESTION: Good evening, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Hi.QUESTION: I like what you say about supporting veterans and how they're important. But I haven't heard what the actual plans are to continue that support beyond words. How do you translate those words to action after you take office?TRUMP: Well, I love that question, because I've been very close to the vets. You see the relationship I have with the vets just by looking at the polls. In fact, today a poll came out. And my relationship has been very good.I have a very, very powerful plan that's on my website that you possibly saw. One of the big problems is the wait time. Vets are waiting six days, seven days, eight days. And by the way, Hillary Clinton six months ago said the vets are being treated essentially just fine, there's no real problem, it's over-exaggerated. She did say that.LAUER: No, no, she went on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the V.A.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Look, I mean, she made up half of the things she said about me. I'm telling you, this is -- she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration.Now, under my plan, if you've got to wait -- and, by the way, people are dying on line. They're dying, waiting, waiting to get to see a doctor. They're waiting five days and six days.Under a part of my plan, if they have that long wait, they walk outside, they go to the local doctor, they choose the doctor, they choose the hospital, whether it's public or private, they get themselves better. In many cases, it's a minor procedure or a pill or just a prescription. And they end up dying because they can't get to see the doctor. We will pay the bill. They go outside, they get a doctor, they get a prescription, they do what they have to do, and we pay the bill.That is something that I have been praised -- and, by the way, I never said take the V.A. -- take the Veterans Administration private. I wouldn't do that. Too much respect for our people. I would never do that.LAUER: OK.TRUMP: I heard it was said that I said that. I would not do that. But I do believe -- I do believe, when you're waiting in line for six, seven days, you should never be in a position like that. You go out, you see the doctor, you get yourself taken care of.LAUER: Hallie, you've got another question.JACKSON: I do. Rachel Fredericks (ph), who specialized in aviations operations in the Marine Corps, serving stateside, she lost two friends to suicide. And you now struggle yourself with PTSD. She's a Republican, but leaning towards you, still undecided a little bit. Rachel, you have a question for Mr. Trump.QUESTION: I do. Mr. Trump, I wanted to ask what your plan will be to stop 20 veterans a day from killing themselves.TRUMP: And actually it's 22. And it's almost impossible to conceive that this is happening in our country, 20 to 22 people a day are killing themselves. A lot of it is they're killing themselves over the fact that they can't -- they're under tremendous pain and they can't see a doctor.We're going to speed up the process. We're going to create a great mental health division. They need help. They need help. They need tremendous help. And we're doing nothing for them.The V.A. is really almost, you could say, a corrupt enterprise. If you look at what's going on, as an example, Matt, in Arizona, where they caught people stealing, and they can't even do anything about it, they can't even fire the people. So we are going to make it efficient and good. And if it's not good, you're going out to private hospitals, public hospitals, and doctors. Thank you very much.LAUER: Hallie, one more?JACKSON: Donald Day (ph) here, who served as a radio operator in the Marine Corps in the Vietnam era. He had tours of duty in Southeast Asia and in Europe. He's also a Democrat and has this question for you.QUESTION: Mr. Trump, I have a daughter who is interested in joining the service, but when she researched the military, she saw the stats on sexual assault and decided not to go. I have a concern about the rape of women in our armed forces. As president, what specifically would you do to support all victims of sexual assault in the military?TRUMP: It's a great question. And it's a massive problem. The numbers are staggering, hard to believe, even. But we're going to have to run it very tight. I at the same time want to keep the court system within the military. I don't think it should be outside of the military. But we have to come down very, very hard on that.And your daughter is absolutely right, it is a massive problem. But we have to do something about that problem. And the best thing we can do is set up a court system within the military. Right now, the court system practically doesn't exist. It takes too long.LAUER: In 2013, on this subject, you tweeted this, quote, ""26,000 unreported sexual assaults in the military, only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men and women together?""TRUMP: Well, it is -- it is -- it is a correct tweet. There are many people that think that that's absolutely correct. And we need to have a...(CROSSTALK)LAUER: So this should have been expected? And does that mean the only way to fix it is to take women out of the military?TRUMP: Well, it's happening, right? And, by the way, since then, it's gotten worse. No, not to take them out, but something has to be happen. Right now, part of the problem is nobody gets prosecuted. You have reported and -- the gentleman can tell you, you have the report of rape and nobody gets prosecuted. There are no consequence.When you have somebody that does something so evil, so bad as that, there has to be consequence for that person. You have to go after that person. Right now, nobody's doing anything. Look at the small number of results. I mean, that's part of the problem.LAUER: So many of the issues that we've talked about with you, Mr. Trump, tonight, and Secretary Clinton, are so complex that even career military people and career diplomats and politicians have trouble getting their arms around them.TRUMP: Right.LAUER: You've had a very different background, in business. So nobody would expect you to have taken over the last 20 years really deep dives into some of these issues. But I'm curious about what you're doing now. What kind of research are you doing now? What kind of homework are you doing? What kind of things are you reading as you prepare for the day in two months where you might be elected the next president of the United States?TRUMP: Sure. Well, in the front row, you have four generals. You have admirals. We have people all throughout the audience that I'm dealing with. Right here is a list that was just printed today of 88 admirals and generals that I meet with and I talk to.LAUER: How much time are you spending on this?TRUMP: I'm also -- a lot. A lot. And I'm doing a lot of different things. Don't forget, we're running a big campaign. We're doing very well. I'm also, you know, and I'm very much giving it to my children and my executives to run, I'm also partially running a business. I'm campaigning, I'm running a business. I've got a lot of hats right now.But we're doing very well. But in the meantime, I am studying. And I'm meeting constantly -- you see -- you see General Flynn and you see some of the folks that we have, and they're scattered throughout the audience. So we have admirals, we have generals, we have colonels. We have a lot of people that I respect.And I think I've learned a lot. But I think, also, I certainly -- I really feel I have a common sense on the various issues that you're talking about, Matt.LAUER: You said in the speech today, you said history shows that when America is not prepared is when the danger is the greatest.TRUMP: And we're not prepared.LAUER: Will you be prepared on day one, if you're elected president of the United States, to tackle these complex national security issues?TRUMP: One hundred percent. Hey, Matt, again, she made a mistake on Libya. She made a terrible mistake on Libya. And the next thing, I mean, not only did she make the mistake, but then they complicated the mistake by having no management once they bombed you know what out of Gadhafi. I mean, she made a terrible mistake on Libya. And part of it was the management aftereffect. I think that we have great management talents, great management skills. LAUER: But you are prepared?TRUMP: And I have to tell you -- totally prepared. But remember this. I found this subject and these subjects of interest all of my life, Matt. This hasn't been over the last 14 months. I've found these substantiates of tremendous interest. That's why they were asking me about Iraq 14 years ago. They were asking me these questions. They don't ask businesspeople those questions.LAUER: Let me end in kind of the same place I started. Have you given much thought, Mr. Trump, if you're elected president and commander-in-chief, to that moment where you're going to have to make that first decision that puts American men and women in harm's way?TRUMP: I think it's the most difficult decision you can possibly ever make. You're talking about death. And we're talking death to not just our side. We're talking death all over. I would be very, very cautious. I think I'd be a lot slower. She has a happy trigger. You look, she votes for the wars, she goes in Libya...(CROSSTALK)LAUER: Have you thought about personally the emotional burden of that moment?TRUMP: I think it's a tremendous burden. I think there is no greater burden that anybody could have. I've been preparing this for a long time. And, you know, my theme is make America great again. We're going to make America great again. But, Matt, we've also got to make America strong again. And right now, we are not strong. Believe me. We have a depleted military. We have the greatest people in the world in our military. But it is very sadly depleted.LAUER: The Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald Trump.TRUMP: Thank you, Matt.LAUER: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)We're going to be much -- we'll be back with much more from the Intrepid carrier on this Commander-in-Chief Forum right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)LAUER: There's a lot of people we want to thank for making tonight a success, the presidential nominees themselves, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. We want to thank the many veterans in our audience for their questions and, most importantly, for their service. We want to thank our hosts at the IAVA, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, and, of course, the Intrepid Sea, Air, and Space Museum, this amazing venue.The first presidential debate will be held on September 26th right here on NBC. It'll be hosted by my colleague, Lester Holt. We hope you'll tune in for that. And more importantly, we hope you get out and vote this November.

See them all at PolitiFact.com.UpdatesPresident Donald Trump, shown in the Oval Office of the White House on May 10, 2017. (Washington Post)Trump 'might' release returns 'when I'm out of office'By John Kruzel on Friday, May 12th, 2017 at 10:31 a.m.President Donald Trump has reneged on a pledge to release his tax returns after an IRS audit, confirming what many have long suspected: that the real obstacle to disclosure is Trump himself.The tax returns came up in a May 4 discussion with The Economist when a reporter asked the president if he would be willing to trade his tax returns for Democratic votes on a tax plan.After incorrectly saying that only reporters care about his returns, Trump said he ""might release them after I'm out of office."" That was new to us given Trump had previously said he would not release them because he is under an audit.""I'm under a routine audit, and it'll be released, and as soon as the audit is finished it will be released,"" Trump said at the first presidential debate in September.The back-and-forth between The Economist, Trump and several administration members is worth reading in full (emphasis ours):The Economist: ""If you do need Democratic support for your ideal tax plan, and the price of that the Democrats say is for you to release your tax returns, would you do that?""Trump: ""I don't know. That's a very interesting question. I doubt it. I doubt it. Because they're not going to…nobody cares about my tax return except for the reporters. Oh, at some point I'll release them. Maybe I'll release them after I'm finished, because I'm very proud of them actually. I did a good job.""Hope Hicks, White House director of strategic communication: ""Once the audit is over.""Trump: ""I might release them after I'm out of office.""Three things are noteworthy about the end of this exchange. First is Hicks' attempt to prod Trump back on script about his IRS audit being the grounds for nondisclosure, and second is Trump's sidestepping of this cue. The most remarkable point is Trump's new position that he reserves the right not to release his tax returns until after he's left office.This contrasts sharply with campaign messaging that saw Trump and his surrogates give more than a dozen excuses for why he was the first presidential nominee in nearly 40 years not to release his tax returns, with new reasons tacked on after he was elected.One such argument was that Trump's financial disclosures more than make up for not releasing his tax returns -- and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin alluded to this in the Economist interview. But as we've shown before , this is a red herring because tax returns may reveal financial information like charitable giving and income sources not necessarily covered in Trump's financial disclosure.Eventually Trump's refusal came to rest upon the IRS audit, which he even alluded to later in the Economist interview. The IRS, however, has said nothing precludes a president from releasing tax returns while under audit ( Nixon did ).But here the president has indicated for the first time that he will not necessarily release his tax returns after the IRS audit. Rather, he reserves the right to keep his tax returns under seal during his time in the White House.They say sunlight's the best disinfectant, and despite Trump's alternative facts about lagging public interest, most voters want to see his shrouded tax returns exposed to the light of day. In fact, two in three voters now believe Congress should pass a law requiring future presidential candidates to release the previous few years of their tax returns.But given Trump's backpedaling, Americans will be kept in the dark for the foreseeable future — and not for the reason previously described. We rate this Promise Broken.Sources:The Economist, ""Transcript: Interview with Donald Trump,"" May 11, 2017Washington Post, ""The first Trump-Clinton presidential debate transcript, annotated,"" Sept. 26, 2016Washington Post, ""All the excuses Trump has given for why he won't release his tax returns,"" Sept. 15, 2016PolitiFact, ""Donald Trump says his financial disclosures more than make up for lack of releasing tax returns,"" Sept. 7, 2016PolitiFact, ""Tim Kaine correctly notes Richard Nixon released tax returns despite audit,"" Oct. 5, 2017Bloomberg-Morning Consult Poll, April 4-5, 2017Quinnipiac Poll, March 22, 2017President Donald Trump ""has no intention"" of releasing his taxes returns to the public, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said April 26. (AP)Trump has 'no intention' of releasing tax returns, Steve Mnuchin saysBy Lauren Carroll on Wednesday, April 26th, 2017 at 7:13 p.m.The 2017 tax filing season has come and gone, and President Donald Trump still hasn't made his tax returns public.According to his Treasury secretary, it's not going to happen.A reporter asked Steve Mnuchin if Trump will release his own returns during an April 26 press conference to lay out Trump's tax plan.""The president has no intention,"" Mnuchin replied. ""The president has released plenty of information and, I think, has given more financial disclosure than anybody else. I think the American population has plenty of information.""Trump was the first major presidential nominee in 40 years not to release his tax returns, citing a routine audit.However, nothing prevents someone from making their tax returns public while undergoing an audit. President Richard Nixon, in fact, released his returns during one.Trump promised that when the audit was over, he would release his returns.Earlier in April, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump's audit was still ongoing, so there was no timeline on when he would release his, tax returns.""We're under the same audit that existed, and so nothing has changed,"" Spicer said in an April 17 press briefing.An interesting note: Since the 1970s and the Watergate era, all presidential tax returns undergo an IRS audit — ""mandatory examination"" — according to the IRS manual .So the taxes Trump filed in 2017 actually do face an audit, but it's unknown how many past years of Trump's tax returns remain under audit. We'll only know Trump's audit is over if and when he decides to inform to the public.Congressional Democrats have warned that if Trump doesn't release his personal returns, it will be difficult to accomplish tax reform. And the New York Times counted more than a dozen Republican lawmakers who say Trump should release them, not to mention broad public support .Given Mnuchin's statement and the fact that the White House continues to drag its feet on releasing any of Trump's tax returns, we rate this promise Stalled.Sources:CQ, Mnuchin and Cohn press briefing, April 26, 2017CQ, White House press briefing, April 17, 2017"

The state legislature is scrambling to pass a budget that would close a projected $400 million shortfall in the next fiscal year. The fiscal crisis is the result of red ink that started gushing after the state passed massive tax cuts in 2012. Back then, Gov. Sam Brownback, a Republican, predicted , ""Our new pro-growth tax policy will be like a shot of adrenaline into the heart of the Kansas economy.""As natural economic experiments go, this was a pretty bold one. The top personal income tax rate was reduced from 6.5 percent to 4.9 percent — and eliminated for small business owners who file as individuals. The reduction was ""the biggest tax cut of any state, relative to the size of its economy, in recent history,"" according to Andrew Wilson, a fellow at the Show-Me Institute, a free-market think tank in Missouri. Economist Arthur Laffer, a Brownback adviser and the ""supply-side"" architect of the 1980s Reagan tax cuts, called it ""a revolution in a cornfield. Brownback and his whole group there, it's an amazing thing they're doing. Truly revolutionary.""But it's hard to see any economic revolution in the data — at least not yet.Over the past two years, Kansas' jobless rate has fallen by 1.1 percentage point — from 5.4 percent to 4.3 percent — versus a 1.5-point drop for its four neighboring states and a 2.2 point drop for the U.S. economy overall. And the Sunflower State's labor force participation rate has been flat. Nor does the Kansas economy appear to be gaining much momentum as the tax cuts' supposed pro-growth effects finally ""kick in."" Over the past six months, the Philadelphia Fed's economic activity tracker finds Kansas again lagging the overall U.S. economy. And in April, Kansas wage and income growth trailed the national average.The reaction to these numbers by Democrats and left-wing pundits has been, unsurprisingly, scathing. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman calls the Kansas experiment a ""spectacular policy failure"" that the GOP will fail to learn from because ""gold bugs and Austrians are more dominant in GOP circles than they were before seven years of wrongly predicting runaway inflation.""Let's set aside the liberal hyperbole for a moment, and instead ask a serious question: What should Republicans learn from the Kansas experiment, especially the GOP's crop of White House wannabes who have plans to deeply cut top tax rates?First, don't expect tax cuts to pay for themselves or even come close. They almost never do . That should be clear not only from the Kansas experiment, but the Bush tax cuts in the 2000s and the Reagan tax cuts in the 1980s. Tax cuts need to be accompanied by budget cuts or some other tax increases or risk bigger deficits.Second, don't expect an immediate economic boom. This is one reason why tax cuts don't pay for themselves. Republicans often favor high-end tax cuts, but such reductions may be more likely to change long-term incentives than provide short-term stimulus. If you're looking for a quick fillip, recent research by University of Chicago economist Owen Zidar finds the ""stimulative effects of income tax cuts are largely driven by tax cuts for the bottom 90 percent."" Also, the link between job growth and tax changes for upper-income earners appears to be ""weak to negligible"" over the business cycle.Third, focus on the long term. Whatever their fiscal impact, the Kansas tax cuts may yet earn some significant economic benefits. A new paper by Enrico Moretti and Daniel Wilson, ""The Effect of State Taxes on the Geographical Location of Top Earners: Evidence from Star Scientists,"" finds that state taxes ""have a significant effect on the geographical location of star scientists and possibly other highly skilled workers."" They calculate, for instance, the effect of New York cutting its marginal tax rate on the top 1 percent of earners in 2006 was ""12 fewer star scientists moving away and 12 more stars moving into New York, for a net increase of 24 stars, a 2.1 percent increase."" Now, that may not sound like much bang for the buck, but it only took the arrival of two pretty smart guys, Bill Gates and Paul Allen, to launch Seattle's tech boom. Likewise, while the Reagan tax cuts may have not boosted U.S. productivity in the 1980s, a case can be made that changing incentives played a key role in the 1990s tech boom. The lesson from Kansas should not be that we ought never, ever cut taxes for rich people or business.And indeed, there may already be some green shoots. As Wilson points out in a Wall Street Journal op-ed , the state has significantly improved its private-sector job growth versus other states.So be patient, Kansas. And while you're waiting, get those bills paid! ADVERTISEMENT"

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/22/barack-obama/updated-eight-houses-for-john-and-cindy-mccain/	John McCain has seven houses.	mostly true	['Candidate Biography']	http://www.nytimes.com/	http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/11/us/politics/11web-nagourney.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin	2008/08/22	But it is a theme that his aides believe proved to be successful, and they are planning to use it aggressively ahead through the Republican convention and into the fall. ( Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, whose appearance in the first celebrity ad drew ridicule from Democrats and Ms. Hilton, will be retired from future spots — after helping draw huge attention in the form of news coverage and nearly 2 million You Tube hits). “The American people are likely not going to want to elect someone to the presidency based on their ability to transform themselves into a celebrity,” said Steve Schmidt, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain. “The advertising is effective because it speaks to a truth that people instantly get. This was inspired by what Mr. McCain’s advisers — and some Democrats - suspect was one mistake Mr. Obama made on his otherwise well-received overseas trip: appearing at a rally before 200,000 Germans in Berlin, an event that lead Mr. McCain’s advisers to describe Mr. Obama as presumptuous and provided the footage for the first so-called celebrity ads (expect to more of that in future ads, highlighted by Mr. Obama presenting himself as a “fellow citizen of the world). If this kind of attack does strike a chord, then Mr. Obama might find he gave Republicans a bit of a gift with his decision to deliver his convention acceptance speech before 76,000 people at a stadium in Denver, an appearance (think tail-gate parties) that seems to have potential to underline the Republican message. Implicit in this approach is an attempt to portray Mr. Obama as different, or alien, from many Americans, reinforcing a reluctance that polls suggest many Americans have about voting for this newcomer. Hence the references to his years at Harvard, his years in Chicago’s Hyde Park, his affection for frequent gym visits and the food he eats, or to the McCain camp’s use of words intended to make Mr. Obama seem elite or effete.

Will all this work? Mr. Obama’s advisers argue that public polling data shows no evidence that it is taking hold, and that the public has little tolerance for this kind of attack at a time when there are so many serious issues facing the nation. “Their intent is obvious, but I don’t see any evidence that they are gaining with this,” said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama’s senior strategist. He said he did not believe that Mr. McCain, of all candidates, could succeed in painting Mr. Obama as elitist. “Obviously, his strategists met on the portico of the McCain estate in Sedona — or maybe in one of his six other houses — and decided what line of attack they were going to use,” he said. While Mr. McCain has used this summer to figure out a way to go after Mr. Obama, Mr. Obama used it to patch up a hole in his resume with his overseas trip. It produced images of Mr. Obama meeting with foreign leaders and visiting troops that even Republicans say would go a long way to addressing voter concerns about his foreign policy credentials. And they permitted Mr. Obama to dominate political coverage for much of July. In downplaying the effectiveness of the Republican attacks on Mr. Obama, Mr. Axelrod was echoing the way Mr. Schmidt and other McCain advisers downplayed the effect of Mr. Obama’s trip. In both cases, the campaigns pointed to polls as evidence that voters weren’t impressed. . But now may not be the time to judge the effectiveness of these tactics; things campaigns do in the summer often are not done with an eye to the daily Gallup tracking poll, but rather for setting the table for the fall. “Some people are paying attention,” said Charlie Black, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain. “But you are laying the foundation for the debate for the fall. Even if people don’t pay enough attention to say, ‘I’m changing my vote’ or ‘I’m making up my mind,’ they do absorb the information. The fact that Mr. McCain’s campaign continues to push this line of attack it trotted out this summer suggests that his camp thinks it works. And Mr. Obama’s campaign, which has seemed both awfully confident and at times hesitant in responding to Mr. McCain, may have learned a lesson that it can put to use this fall. “We need to make sure that he is paying a price for his negativity,” said David Plouffe, Mr. Obama’s campaign manager. “The lesson here is that the media is definitely going to cover the theater of the absurd. And we have to be very mindful of that. George Bush didn’t have to worry so much about that, but John McCain is viewed by some independent voters as a different kind of politician.

In an interview Monday morning, Clinton was visibly frustrated with the ongoing Benghazi investigation.""There have been seven investigations led mostly by Republicans in the Congress,"" Clinton said. ""And they were nonpartisan, and they reached conclusions that, first of all, I and nobody did anything wrong, but there were changes we could make. This committee was set up, as they have admitted, for the purpose of making a partisan political issue out of the deaths of four Americans.""Is Clinton correct that there have been seven and now eight investigations into Benghazi? We started counting and found she was largely accurate.Here’s what we found.BackgroundClinton was secretary of state when Islamic extremists attacked a U.S. diplomatic mission and a CIA compound in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012. U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans died in the barrage.In the weeks following the attack, the White House was heavily questioned for its response to the terrorist attack. Many debated, among conflicting reports from intelligence officials, what role al-Qaeda played in the attack and how much the White House knew about the group’s involvement. Critics also questioned whether Clinton and the State Department could have better addressed security at the U.S. facilities before they were attacked. The debate got more partisan as time went on, as Republicans began speaking of conspiracy theories and cover-ups .The seven probes mentioned by Clinton include only those conducted by Congress, but there was at least one more. After the attack, Clinton convened an Accountability Review Board to investigate the incident -- something she was legally required to do. The Board’s report found no fault in the State Department for the terrorist attacks but acknowledged ""systematic failures and leadership and management deficiencies"" that left Benghazi vulnerable. Four State Department officials were temporarily suspended and ultimately reassigned within the department.It should be noted that each congressional committee that investigated the Benghazi attack looked into different aspects of the event. After the attack, Republican Speaker John Boehner directed the House Committees on Oversight and Government Reform, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, Armed Services and Intelligence to investigate the issues within their jurisdictions. The House investigations were led by Republicans. Two bipartisan Senate Committees also investigated the attack.Clinton said the committees found that she and her department had not committed wrongdoing but suggested changes. Actually, almost every committee report found her department did not adequately address security concerns in Libya or could have done more to prevent the attack. Clinton’s words give the best possible spin to the various committee findings, but she’s also essentially accurate.Here’s a list of all the congressional investigations and what they found.Investigation 1: The House Committee on Oversight and Government ReformThe House Oversight Committee was one of the first committees to question Clinton following the Benghazi attack. On Sept. 16, 2013, the Republican-led committee released an interim report on the Accountability Review Board appointed by Clinton. The report raised questions about the independence and integrity of the Accountability Review Board (since Clinton appointed the board to investigate her own department) and criticized the conclusions in the board’s final report.Investigation 2: The Senate Committee On Homeland Security And Governmental AffairsThis bipartisan committee released a report in December 2012 detailing the ""high risk"" of a terrorist attack at the U.S. facilities in Libya. While the report criticized the State Department for not addressing the security concerns leading up to the attack, it also found ""administration officials were inconsistent in stating publicly that the deaths in Benghazi were the result of a terrorist attack."" The report attributed the State Department’s security failures to intelligence problems and a failure ""to imagine the type of attack that occurred.""Investigation 3: The Senate Select Committee on IntelligenceThe Senate Intelligence Committee released a bipartisan report in January 2014 calling the Benghazi attacks ""preventable."" Among other findings, the committee concluded the State Department had received ample warning about deteriorating security in Libya and failed to adequately increase security in the weeks leading up to the attack. The report also faulted intelligence officials for not relaying information on the CIA annex to the U.S. military.Investigation 4: The House Committee on Foreign AffairsClinton testified before this House committee on Jan. 23, 2013 (she also testified in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier that day). The House Committee on Foreign Affairs later released a report criticizing Clinton and other high-ranking officials who they said were ""provided extensive warning of the deteriorating security environment in eastern Libya."" The report also criticized the State Department’s Accountability Review Board, which ""was seriously deficient in several respects,"" especially in its failure to comment on the actions of the department’s highest ranking officials, including Clinton.Investigation 5: The House Committee on the JudiciaryThe focus of the Committee on the Judiciary’s probe was the FBI investigation that followed the terrorist attack. The committee released its findings in April 2013 as part of an interim progress report in conjunction with the five other Republican-led committees investigating Benghazi. The report detailed how the FBI did not investigate the scene until three weeks after the attack and spent less than one day collecting evidence in Benghazi. The committee also faulted Clinton for reducing security at the Benghazi consulate, despite her testimony that she ""had no knowledge"" of security requests from the compound.Investigation 6: The House Committee on Armed ServicesThe Armed Services Committee began its investigation ""immediately after the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya… to evaluate the response of the Department of Defense"" to the attack, according to a February 2014 committee report . The Republican-led committee bashed the Obama administration’s failure to address security threats in Benghazi, asserting that the military was unprepared for possible violence in Libya.Investigation 7: The House Permanent Select Committee on IntelligenceThe House Intelligence Committee concluded its two-year Benghazi investigation in November 2014 when it released a report exonerating the Obama administration of wrongdoing in its response to the attack. The report found evidence of contradicting intelligence among government officials and concluded officials did not intentionally mislead the public with information in the days following the attack.Ongoing Investigation 8: The House Select Committee on BenghaziThe Republican-led House created the House Select Committee on Benghazi in May 2014 after a conservative watchdog group discovered new State Department emails about the attacks. The committee includes seven Republicans and five Democrats. The group released an interim progress report in May 2015, but the committee’s Democrats have been outspoken on the committee’s lack of progress.Clinton, who has faced more scrutiny over Benghazi after it was discovered she used a private email server while serving as Secretary of State, is set to testify before the Benghazi panel on Oct. 22.Our rulingClinton said, ""There have been seven investigations (of Benghazi) led mostly by Republicans in the Congress"" that concluded ""nobody did anything wrong, but there were changes we could make.""Clinton’s number is correct: there were seven previous congressional probes into the Benghazi attack. Saying these committees were led ""mostly by Republicans"" is also a fair assertion: the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs were the only two committees not led by Republicans. As for her comment that there was no overt wrongdoing, just room for improvement, that’s a rosy assessment. But it is also largely accurate. We rate this claim Mostly True.Advertisement"

The United States ordered the EU to impose sanctions and frankly we have overestimated the independence of the European Union [from the US].”“Sanctions are a sign of irritation, they are not the instrument of serious policies,” he added.Lavrov also hit out at the US Congress, which on Saturday unanimously approved the Ukraine Freedom Support Act in both houses, which includes fresh sanctions against Moscow.When asked if he believed the US was trying to impose regime change in Moscow by undermining the Russian economy, Lavrov said he had “very serious reasons to believe this is the case”.“If you look at US Congress, 80 percent of them have never left the USA, so I’m not surprised about Russophobia in Congress,” he said.Lavrov insisted Russia was determined to find a solution for the Ukrainian crisis and that Russia “supports the territorial integrity of Ukraine”.But when asked if this included Crimea, which split from Ukraine in March 2014, Lavrov said: “Crimea is unique, it is the one and only, it is Russian land. It was the will of the [Crimean people].”Lavrov also discussed Russian policy towards NATO, which has “cut practically all ties with Russia” while moving “close to the Russian border” but still wanted Russian help training Afghan pilots.“It’s childish – but what to do?” he said. “Sometimes the big boys play games.”On the subject of France’s decision to suspend the delivery of two Mistral-class warships to Russia over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Lavrov said he would not comment on a deal that “is about a signed legal contract and the dignity of the French nation”.

For example, focusing on the Texas-only data actually obscures rather than illuminates if you are trying to help Texans gauge the risk. Two of the big dangers to us are sea level rise and Gulf hurricanes. Those risks are going to be driven by polar region warming (ice melt) and ocean surface temperatures (thermal expansion of ocean water and hurricane-fueling hot ocean surfaces) vs. average land temps in Texas. Flooding in Central Texas would also be affected by ocean temps and the regional weather dynamics they set up. In short: the fact that we may not set a record in a given year here in Texas won't protect us from the impacts of a record-setting year globally, so the global temps should get our attention.

(AP)The myth that President Barack Obama is a Muslim refuses to die. Seven years after a full debunking in the 2008 election, nearly 3 out of 10 people still believe it, according to a recent CNN poll . Among Republicans, the number rises to over 4 out of 10. Donald Trump’s supporters seem particularly attached to the notion. Over 60 percent of them hold on to this falsehood, based on a survey by the Democratic-leaning group Public Policy Polling .The idea is strong enough that even 15 percent of Democrats think it’s true. Oddly, some Democrats played a role in spreading it, and some have asserted that Hillary Clinton is among that group.The topic got play two days in a row on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. On Monday , Sept. 21, 2015, host Joe Scarborough and a guest stated firmly that the rumor actually began with Clinton during the bruising race for the Democratic nomination.""This started with Hillary Clinton, and it was spread by the Clinton team in 2008,"" Scarborough said.The next day, the show dialed it down a bit.They played a clip of Clinton rejecting the lie about Obama’s religion in a 2008 interview. Somewhat cautiously, Clinton explained why she didn’t think Obama was a Muslim.""There is no basis for that,"" she said. ""I take him on the basis of what he says.""Ron Fournier of National Journal said Clinton was dancing around a flap that had emerged shortly before that interview.""There's stuff going on behind-the-scenes,"" Fournier said on MSNBC. ""People working for the Clintons in part of the rings of the circle were spreading the rumors. That's where it started.""As Scarborough quickly noted, the email rumors date back to 2004. But to some extent, Fournier had a point. There’s a distant tie to Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign. It isn’t much of a connection, but it’s not totally absent either.In the fall of 2007, it was clear that Clinton was losing ground in Iowa. The presumptive front runner was vulnerable and people in the campaign knew it. On Dec. 5, 2007, the online magazine Politico posted the text of an email that had been forwarded by Judy Rose, the volunteer chair of the Clinton campaign in Jones County Iowa on Nov. 21, 2007. The email was a quintessential smear that offered a distorted biography of Obama’s early years. Rose offered no commentary on it. She simply passed it along.""Obama takes great care to conceal the fact that he is a Muslim,"" the email said, and it ended with, ""The Muslims have said they plan on destroying the U.S. from the inside out, what better way to start than at the highest level - through the President of the United States , one of their own!!!!""Rose, sent this to eight of her fellow Democrats. One of them was Clinton campaign staffer Ryan Callanan who replied to the email on the same day in November.""I’ve gotten this forward before,"" Callanan wrote. ""It’s racist and ignorant. I can’t believe that people believe this stuff.""The public airing of the email brought a quick reaction from the Clinton campaign. On Dec. 6, 2007, the Associated Press reported that Rose had resigned as chair of her county committee.""There is no place in our campaign, or any campaign, for this kind of politics,"" Clinton campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle said. ""A volunteer county coordinator made the mistake of forwarding an outrageous and offensive chain e-mail. This was wholly unauthorized and we were totally unaware of it.""A few days later, a second volunteer in a different county stepped down when it was learned that she had forwarded a similar email in October.These are the only two instances where Clinton campaign volunteers, much less staff, are known to have spread the false story about Obama’s religion. The number of recipients totalled 19 people.Danielle Allen is director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University. Allen supported Obama, and in 2008, she tracked the origins of this claim to a perennial candidate and litigant in Illinois named Andy Martin in 2004. Allen said bloggers took some ideas from Martin and embellished them over the years. In October 2007, Politico reported that versions of the slur were circulating in South Carolina, apparently with zero connection to the Clinton campaign.Allen characterized the Clinton emails in Iowa as ""low-level, opportunistic use, pretty quickly squelched, of something that emerged on the right.""The episode in Iowa fueled a testy exchange between Obama and Clinton on the tarmac of Reagan National Airport in December 2007. According to accounts from people who were there, Obama complained about the emails and Clinton boiled over in anger.When asked about Clinton and the Obama-Muslim myth, Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for the Clinton’s current campaign, told us ""Clinton never pushed that.""There are actually two intertwined falsehoods about Obama. One is that he is a Muslim and the other is that he was not born in the United States, also known as the birther movement. After Clinton conceded the primary to Obama, a relative handful of renegade Clinton backers jumped on the birther bandwagon to desperately snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Trump became the birther movement’s loudest megaphone when he toyed with a presidential bid in 2011.Trump accused Clinton of starting the birther movement, a claim we rated False . Obama’s Hawaiian birth certificate is rock solid, and there is no sign that the Clinton campaign ever had anything to do with questioning that.As for the myth that Obama is a Muslim, the record shows that a couple of Clinton campaign volunteers in Iowa passed along emails with that claim. Such emails had been circulating for several months. The volunteers did not share this rumor widely, and at least one paid Clinton staffer immediately renounced it. The Clinton campaign moved quickly to remove the volunteers. We could find no evidence of a deeper connection to Clinton or her campaign.Related rulings:— Donald Trump, Tuesday, September 22nd, 2015.See related rulings"

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. KARL: Let's make a deal. SEN. ROBERT MENENDEZ, R-N.J.: All of the major issues have largely been agreed to. KARL: Congress is finally moving forward on immigration. Plus... SEN. PATRICK J. TOOMEY, R-PA.: I don't consider criminal background checks to be gun control. KARL: A bipartisan breakthrough on guns. But will either deal survive? We've got key players on all sides. Republicans Marco Rubio, and Jeff Sessions, and Democrat Chuck Schumer. Then our powerhouse roundtable on all the week's politics. The president jumps into the budget battle. OBAMA: I've already met Republicans more than halfway. BOEHNER: Listen, why don't we do what we can agree to do? KARL: And, Jay-Z's rap on his Cuba flap. Plus, we celebrate Jackie Robinson's legacy with baseball legend, Mariano Rivera, only on this week. ANNOUNCER: From ABC News, This Week with George Stephanopoulos. Reporting from the Museum in Washington is Chief White House Correspondent, Jonathan Karl. KARL: Hello again. George is off, and it's great to have you with us. The last session of Congress was the least productive in history, but there are signs that may be about to change. There is a lot of talk about bipartisan compromise this week, including indications that the long awaited immigration bill is about to be revealed. So, what's in the plan? We're joined by the Republican Party's point man on immigration, Florida Senator Marco Rubio. Senator Rubio, thank you for joining us. RUBIO: Thank you, Jonathan. KARL: So you are considered the key to getting immigration reform passed. My question this morning is, do we have a deal? RUBIO: Well, first of all, let me say, I am not the key. I think there's 92 other senators and eight (ph) that I've worked, so (ph) many (ph) others that I've worked with that are key to this as well. So I am just here today to communicate to you the importance of this issue, and hopefully what we've agreed to. Let me say this about - you asked me if there was an agreement. The answer is, we've been working very hard, and I think we have come to a position now where we've been able to tell our staffs to draft something. We need to read that, and that's what we're in the process of doing. But I am very optimistic that we're going to have something very positive to share with the American people here very, very soon, perhaps as early as this week. KARL: But to be clear, you're talking about something that will give a path to citizenship for those that are in the country illegally right now, and in fact, give them legal status six months after this becomes law. RUBIO: Well, first of all, I think it's important to understand it does not give anything. It allows people access to the legal immigration system. Number two, some people won't qualify. They haven't been here long enough; they've committed very serious crimes. They won't be able to stay. Number three is all people will get an opportunity to apply for things, to apply for a legal status, which isn't awarded on day one. I mean, there is a process for that. You have to pay an application fee and a fine, and you are going to have to stay in that status while you pay taxes and prove that you are not a public charge. And you don't qualify for any federal benefits. And after some period of time, over 10 years that's elapsed, the only thing you will get - assuming that the border is secure, that e-verify is in place, that an entry exit system is in place for tracking visas, then the only thing you get is the chance to apply for a green card, like everybody else does. The only thing you are earning here is an opportunity to apply for temporary status, and ultimately potentially to apply for a green card, the way everybody else does. And that's the process that we are outlining. KARL: But you are already taking heat from some of your own natural allies on the right. Congressman King, Steve King in the House is calling this amnesty. He said this week that what you're talking would, quote, ""pardon immigration lawbreakers and reward them with the object of their crime."" And Senator Ted Cruz, Republican in the Senate, was just as harsh. Listen to what he had to say. SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS: If we pass something that allows those here illegally to achieve citizenship, it means you're a chump for having stayed in your own country and followed the rules. KARL: So? Your response? RUBIO: Well, first of all, the existing law allows people that are here illegally to gain access to citizenship. What it says is you have to go back to your country of birth and you have to wait 10 years, and then you can apply for it. All we've done here is create an alternative to that that they can access, and the alternative we've created is going to be longer, more expensive and more difficult to navigate. It will actually be cheaper if they went back home, waited 10 years, and applied for a green card. And so, secondly, we've not awarding anything. All we're giving people the opportunity to eventually do is gain access to the same legal immigration system, the same legal immigration process that will be available to everybody else. And number three, in exchange for all of that, we are going to get the toughest enforcement measures in the history of this country. We're going to secure the border to the extent that's possible. We're going to have an entry and exit system to track visas, because 40 percent of our illegal immigrants are people that entered legally and overstayed, and we are going to have e-verify, universally, which means that you will not be able to find a job in the United States if you're not legally here. KARL: Now, one of your toughest Republican critics on this, Senator Sessions, is listening to this interview right now. And he asked the question, is this bill enforcement first or is it legalization first? And the bottom line is, with legalization being in just six months, the answer is, this is legalization first, isn't it? RUBIO: Well, first - yeah, but it's, well, but it's important to understand that. If you do just – that was my original position. The problem is what do we do in the meantime? While you're doing all these enforcement mechanisms, what do you do with the millions of people that are undocumented? Is it a big game of cat and mouse, where if we catch you, you have to leave, but if we don't catch you, in the future you get to apply? I want to know who's here now, and I want to freeze the problem in place so it does not get worse. That's the first thing. The second thing is we don't want a rush on the border. We don't want people to think, well, they are still doing this enforcement stuff, but at some point in a few years, they're going to actually start some process, so let me sneak in now to take advantage of it. We don't want that either. What I want is to freeze the problem that's in place. Look, I'm not happy about the fact that we have millions of people here illegally, and quite frankly, those decisions that led to that happening were made when I was in ninth grade. But that's what we have. This is not a theory, it is the reality, and what we have today is we don't do anything about it. It's de facto amnesty. What I'm saying is, let's bring these people out so we can figure out who needs to leave and who we're going to give a chance to earn their way towards one day being able to apply for a green card, the same way everybody else does. And I think that's why that is a better approach. KARL: All right, let's talk for a second about the politics here. What is at stake for the Republican party here? What will it do to your party if the conservatives who oppose this succeed in killing it? RUBIO: Well, first of all, look, I think that I am looking to the other 92 senators weighing in, because I think they're going to make it better. There are eight of us that have worked on this, and we've worked very hard, but there are 92 other people with their own ideas, and I have tried to incorporate as many of their ideas as possible, given the bills that they have filed in the past. Some of them have submitted letters that outlined concerns, and we have answers for all of those concerns. But I look forward to how they can improve this bill and this product. As far as the Republican Party is concerned, I just want the Republican Party to be what it's always been. I want the conservative movement to be what it's always been about, and that is solving problems in a way that's true to our values and the principles of the greatest nation on earth. And immigration is a problem. Even if we didn't have a single illegal immigrant in the United States, we'd have to do immigration reforms, because our legal immigration system is broken. Immigration is a problem because our laws are not enforced. They are not enforced. We have no way to track people that are overstaying their visas. We have no way to keep people from taking jobs away from Americans, and we have not secured our border, leading not just to our immigration problem, but to a national security sovereignty and humanitarian problem on the border. And this bill hopefully achieves progress on all three of those fronts, and I just hope that I can convince people that leaving things the way they are now is much worse than approaching it the way we've outlined. KARL: OK, I want to move to the other big bipartisan compromise that emerged last week or this week, which is the deal on guns. Now, when you were in the Florida state legislature, you supported background checks, and back in 2007, you said that - let me see if I can get the - ""if someone is a dangerous person who has shown a proclivity for using firearms to hurt other people, then we don't want them having a permit, much less ownership of a firearms. So my question to you is I assume you still believe that. You don't want dangerous people with a proclivity to commit crimes. RUBIO: Everybody believes that. KARL: So why not have background checks to buy a gun? What's wrong with having background checks at gun shows? RUBIO: First of all, we do have background checks. RUBIO: -- de facto background check. KARL: But Senator, we don't have background checks for all sales at gun shows. We don't have background checks for all sales online. What the Manchin-Toomey compromise would do would say all of those sales, too, have background checks. What's wrong with that? RUBIO: Well, first of all, do you want the background check, because the background check system right now does not work because it's not being enforced. Number two is, criminals don't care about the laws that we pass with regards to guns. They never follow the law. That's why they are criminals. Look, here is the bottom line. I think everyone is in favor of any law that could effectively keep criminals or dangerous people from getting access to guns. The problem is that all these laws that people are discussing will not effectively deal with that problem, but will infringe on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. And so, what we need to look for is a compromise that actually accomplishes that, that does not infringe or place additional burdens on law-abiding citizens, and in fact is effective at keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people, and that begins by enforcing it. Are we going to start prosecuting people that are trying to buy guns and fail a background check? Because they are not prosecuting those right now. Are we going to honor conceal-carry permits from across state lines? Because someone who has a conceal-carry permit has been background checked. That's why they have one. Are we going to honor those in a gun show in other parts of the country? I think that should be part of the bill. And here is my bigger point. This debate about guns, we are missing a golden opportunity to have the real debate we should be having, and that is a debate about violence. Guns are what they're using to commit the violence, but the problem is violence, and no one is focusing on why this society has become so violent, why young people in America are committing these horrifying acts, and we are missing a golden opportunity to discuss that, and not simply just focus on gun laws that only law-abiding people will follow. KARL: Senator, we're almost out of time, but I've got to ask you about the Cuban vacation for Jay-Z and Beyonce, going down to Cuba on a cultural visa from the Treasury Department. You obviously said you thought that was a mistake to allow them to go down there. Jay-Z was pretty harsh. You know what Jay-Z is saying, let's be clear, was pretty harsh about critics like you, saying what's wrong, he's not a criminal for simply going down to Cuba. So what's your message back to Jay-Z? You can rap it if you want. He rapped his message to you. RUBIO: Well, I won't rap it, but I'll say, I mean, first of all, I think Jay-Z needs to get informed. One of his heroes is Che Guevara. Che Guevara was a racist. Che Guevara was a racist that wrote extensively about the superiority of white Europeans over people of African descent, so he should inform himself on the guy that he's propping up. Secondly, I think if Jay-Z was truly interested in the true state of affairs in Cuba, he would have met people that are being oppressed, including a hip-hop artist in Cuba who is right now being oppressed and persecuted and is undergoing a hunger strike because of his political lyrics. And I think he missed an opportunity. But that's Jay-Z's issue. The bigger point is the travel policies. The travel policies need to be tightened because they are being abused. These are tourist trips, and they are – what they're doing is providing hard currency and funding so that a tyrannical regime can maintain its grip on the island of Cuba, and I think that's wrong. KARL: All right, Senator Rubio, thank you for joining us on ""This Week."" KARL: And we're joined now by another member of the gang of eight, New York Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer and Alabama Republican Senator Jeff Sessions. Senator Sessions, you heard Senator Rubio's pitch to conservatives like you, in fact you specifically. Are you convinced? SESSIONS: No, I'm not convinced. I know Senator Rubio's heart is exactly right. And I really respect the work of the gang of eight. But they have produced legislation, it appears -- although it looks like now it may be another week before we see it, that will give amnesty now, legalize everyone that's here effectively today and then there's a promise of enforcement in the future. Even if you pass laws today that appear to be effective, it doesn't mean they're going to be enforced. And we have in this administration, a failure to enforce. So that's a big deal right now. KARL: But doesn't Senator Rubio have a point that those that are here now effectively have amnesty? I mean, nobody is prosecuting the 11 million undocumented immigrants that are in the country right now. SESSIONS: You're exactly right. We have got a real problem with that situation. And what we need to do is to analyze how to handle it, how to make sure that we do the right thing for America. I think it's incumbent on Republicans, Democrats, and every one of us to ask what is going to happen to working Americans whose wages have been falling since 2000 who are unemployed at a very high rate. It will impact them adversely. We have to ask how the new flow of workers is going to be maybe double the current flow of legal workers in the future, in addition to those who will be legalized, 11 million. How that will impact them. So, I think the public interest is to figure out how we can deal with the crisis we face, how we can have a lawful system that serves the national interest without hammering, as the civil rights commission members have said, the average low-income worker, the African-American and Hispanic worker that's here. KARL: So, Senator Schumer, is this amnesty first? SCHUMER: No, not at all. This is a very balanced bill. The American people have told us to do two things. One, prevent future flows of illegal immigration and then, come up with a common sense solution for legal immigration. And that's what our bill does. You know, we've worked long and hard on this so, we're very, very close. Every major -- every significant disagreement among the eight of us is resolved. And I expect we will -- the eight of us will introduce a bill on Tuesday. Obviously, there have been problems. But last Friday night, this past Friday night, under Dianne Feinstein's leadership, the last problem, agriculture, was agreed to. The growers and the farm workers are there. So of course, we've all said, until the eight of us sign that bill, put our names on it, Tuesday, we don't have final agreement. But I see nothing in the way. And I think you'll see a major agreement that's balanced but fair, that will have the widespread support of the American people on Tuesday. KARL: But you know, Senator Schumer, I've talked to some of those who have been advocating this for a long time who say the Republican Party has their back against the wall on this, with Hispanic voters, that Democrats are driving this and that you guys are giving up too much. I mean, under this compromise, as I understand it, somebody would have to wait ten years before even getting a green card, 13 years before, at the very earliest, they could be eligible for citizenship. Even somebody who has been in the country for 20 years. Have you given up too much on this? SCHUMER: Well, I'm not going to get into specifics. But the eight of us have met in the middle. And I think that's where the American people are. They want a solution to immigration, as Marco Rubio said, and he's been a tremendous asset here. As Marco Rubio has said, the present situation is untenable. This is a balanced approach that both prevents future waves of illegal immigration, but has common sense solutions. Look at what we do now. We turn away people who could actually create jobs in America. And at the same time, we let people come across our border who take jobs away from Americans. Who wouldn't want to fix that in a fair and balanced way? And that's what we're doing. KARL: So, let me ask you, Senator Sessions, you have said there are just too many unanswered questions about what this does. You put out a bunch of them. You have got one of the principal architects of this compromise right here. Fire away. What's your question? SESSIONS: Well, I would ask Senator Schumer this, if this legislation is established by reputable economists as pulling down the wages of already suffering low-wage American workers, will you continue to push for it? SCHUMER: The bottom line, that's not going to happen, Jeff. SESSIONS: Well, you have to read the statistics. You didn't have hearings with these top economists who studied this over the years publicly, to determine the impact. And they say it will have that impact, as does the civil rights commission members. SCHUMER: First of all -- let me just answer. First of all, it's very logical, right now, who's pulling down wage rates? Illegal people who cross the border and will work because they're illegal and have no protections for much less than Americans will work for. Second, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, one of the most conservative true blue economists said this will raise wages and increase GDP. Cato institute, people who you usually agree with, Jeff, say this is going to be a shot in the arm for our economy because we'll take people in who will create jobs and prevent people who are coming in from lowering wages and taking away American jobs. It's such a logical approach. SESSIONS: Well, it's logical that if you bring in a massive supply of low-wage workers, you're going to pull the workers down. SCHUMER: They're already here, though, aren't they? SESSIONS: Well, you're talking about almost doubling the... SCHUMER: That's the point, isn't it? SESSIONS: You're bringing in huge more numbers of legal workers, Chuck. And the ag people that you've been listening to are getting what they want, others are getting what they want, but it will impact and... KARL: Very quickly, and then I have to move on -- Senator Schumer... SCHUMER: Jonathan, the bottom line is very simple, the number of illegal people will greatly decrease and the number of legal people will not equal the number of illegals who cross the border. But they will have to be part -- let me just finish. They will have to be part of our society. They will not be able to bring down wages, work for less than minimum wage, be in the shadows, et cetera. So, it's very good. Why do you think labor is supporting this proposal, not because it will bring down wages, but because it will be a real opportunity for Americans to gain more jobs. So, I need to move on to the other big compromise -- and I know you guys also don't see eye to eye on this, this guns compromise. And, Senator Schumer, obviously you were part of crafting this Toomey-Manchin agreement on background checks, which looks like it has a chance. But can you be blunt, honest, candid, forthright with me here, the other aspects of the president's agenda are going to go nowhere, right? We are not going to see an assault weapons ban come out of the senate, are we? SCHUMER: Well, look, we're going to fight as hard as we can for -- I am anyway, for assault weapons ban and limitation on clips. But the sweet spot is background checks. It will do the most good, according to all the experts, in terms of preventing criminals and those adjudicated mentally ill, from getting guns and at the same time, has the best chance of passing. Having said that, Jonathan, it's a hard road. Not all of the Republicans who voted to allow debate are going to vote with us on background checks. So, it's going to be a tough fight to even get the 60 votes we need for the Manchin-Toomey proposal. KARL: And in fact you're not going to have all of the Democrats. You had a number of red state Democrats who simply don't like what we're seeing, even on the background checks. Let me look at two of them, Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, said in our party -- in our part of the country, this isn't an issue, this is a way of life. This is how people feel. I'm going to represent my state. And Senator Max Baucus, Montana, said I don't support the bill. Montanans are opposed to this bill by a very large margin. How are you going to convince Democrats to get on board? SCHUMER: Well, we're going to have the overwhelming majority of Democrats be for this. But as you know well, Jonathan, in the senate, you can't get anything major done because you need 60 votes without bipartisan support. And we're working really hard to maximize both, the number of Democrats who will be the overwhelming majority of those who vote for it, and a number of Republicans. The key battle is with a handful of Republicans who voted for closing debate, but haven't yet committed on background checks, even the modifications that Manchin and Toomey have proposed. And there as a no, but both got A-ratings from the NRA in the past. KARL: Probably not any more. Senator Sessions, you obviously oppose this. Are you going to be able to stop it or are background checks going to pass? SESSIONS: Before I get that, I just want to say this bill as we understand it, on immigration, will increase the legal flow of low-skill, low-wage workers and it will adversely impact workers. KARL: But very quickly, are you going to be able to defeat the background checks? SESSIONS: I don't think it's going to pass. The president of the United States has allowed, each year he's been here, the prosecutions of gun cases to go down. I was a federal prosecutor. I prosecuted those. He needs to prosecute the laws that we have today. They've declined every year since President Bush left office. KARL: Senator Schumer, before we go, need to ask you about somebody who -- some have called your former protege, Anthony Weiner, obviously left congress in disgrace, now is considering a run for mayor. I don't expect you to make any endorsements in the mayor's race, but tell me, does Anthony Weiner deserve a second chance? SCHUMER: Look, I'm not going to comment on that. How did I know you'd ask that question, Jonathan? KARL: You're not going to comment at all? Do you think he... KARL: Not even whether he deserves a second chance? KARL: No comment at all? That is rare. We have Senator Schumer with a no comment. Thank you very much, senator. Appreciate it. Thank you for coming on ""This Week."" SCHUMER: Time and season for everything, Jonathan. SESSIONS: Thank you. I appreciate the talk and the work they've done. We've got a lot of work to do yet. And we need to read their bill. KARL: All right. Thank you very much. Coming up, our powerhouse roundtable on guns, immigration and the secret recordings of Mitch McConnell's campaign strategy sessions. Plus, our exclusive on Jackie Robinson's legacy, with another number 42, Yankee legend Mariano Rivera. KARL: Twitter got more crowded this week with President Bill Clinton jumping in, thanks toStephen Colbert. STEPHEN COLBERT, COLBERT REPORT: Would you like to break into the 21st Century right now and send your first tweet? BILL CLINTON, FRM. PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Just spent... COLBERT: ...just spent. CLINTON: ...amazing time with Colbert. CLINTON: Is -- question. Is he sane? Sir, welcome to the future. MANCHIN: I'm a parent. I'm a grandparent. I can't imagine, I just -- I can do something. I can do something. MICHELLE OBAMA, FIRST LADY: I urge them to use their lives to give meaning to Hadiya Pendleton's life. I urge them to dream as big as she did and work as hard as she did and live a life that honors every last bit of her God-given promise. KARL: That was the first lady and Senator Joe Manchin, part of an emotional week in the gun debate. We'll get to that in a moment, but first, we have our roundtable. George Will, as always, Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post, Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, Republican chairman of the judiciary committee, Luis Gutierrez, Democrat of Illinois, Kim Strassel with the Wall Street Journal. George, right to you. You heard a debate among Republicans on immigration, which side should the Republican Party come down on? GEORGE WILL, CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST: Every conservative sympathizes with what Jeff Sessions was saying about not rewarding law breaking, however, conservatism begins with facing facts. The facts are that of the 11 million people who are here illegally, two-thirds have been a decade or more, 30 percent, 15 years or more. They're woven into our society. They're not leaving. And the American people would not tolerate the police measures necessary to extract them from our community. Therefore, the great consensus has to be on the details of a path to citizenship. The most important thing Rubio said in your interview was, even if the system weren't broken, if you had no illegal immigrants, we'd still need to do something about this because we need the workers, as the baby boomers retire, and as the birthrate declines. We need something to replenish the workplace to sustain the welfare state. KARL: The framing from Rubio was interesting, saying we really already have amnesty. Nobody's prosecuting the undocumented immigrants here now. MARCUS: Absolutely, I want to say I'm going to really enjoy saying this next sentence. I completely agree with every syllable that George Will just said. And I think that the stars are in alignment for many of the reasons that he said. The issue is less of a hot button that it was, in part because net migration from Mexico is zero. Technology has been our friend on immigration, both in the workplace and in terms of drone surveillance on the border. It's easier to achieve enforcement. And Republicans, most of them, have realized not just the facts on the ground of immigration, but the political facts on the ground, that their party is going to have to get right on this issue. KARL: But Mr. Chairman we've been here before. I mean 2006, the Senate, 61 votes I think it was 62 votes passed Immigration Reform. And it died in the House. Because Republicans in the House wouldn't even bring it up. Is that going to happen again this time? KARL: But it passed in 2006. GOODLATTE: OK well look, the fact of the matter is we have to learn the lessons of both 1986 and 2007. In 1986 we passed an Immigration Law that allowed close to three million people to get here, to stay here and get permanent resident status. And if they wanted citizenship. --by every president, not just the current one, have been only honored in the breech. That is a key question that has to be addressed this time. The second time, 2007, I think it failed because it was done from the top down. And the Senate right now is at a critical point. KARL: Is that a problem for you? GOODLATTE: Not a problem for me. But it is a problem how they go from here. It is absolutely important that they follow regular order, Marco Rubio is right, that they have a full exposition of it. He said this morning to you, it would be wonderful to have the other 92 Senators have their full input in this process and bring it from the ground up. The same thing you see happen in the House. KARL: But a quick bottom line, do you think what he's talking about, what Rubio's talking about, could you envision it passing in the House? GOODLATTE: I think, I think the specifics of that bill will be different than the specifics of the bill in the House. But we have to address legal immigration and reform, we have to address enforcement. And we have to address what we do with 11 million or more people who are not lawfully here. And I think we can do that in a bipartisan way. We got to get the enforcement part right. And not just what the law says, but making sure that no one person, President of the United States, can flip a switch and not enforce the law as many presidents have done before. That's going to be a key, key question here. GUTIERREZ: I haven't seen in my memory, at least my 20 years, such a dramatic and sudden change in attitude towards a public policy issue, like the one we've seen after November 6, among the members of Congress and the House of Representatives. The fact that Chairman Goodlatte and I can be on this program together and agree that we're going to move forward on resolving our broken immigration system, I think demonstrates that sea change that exists. Look I've been working on this issue for 20 years. We're making real progress. I see real history being written in this Congress, and I see it written this year and signed by the President of the United States. Next Tuesday, next Monday, the 22nd, Representative Paul Ryan is going to come down from Michigan and join me before the City Club. KARL: You guys always hang out so, sure. GUTIERREZ: Ryan and Gutierrez are always the best (inaudible). Interestingly enough, they sold out in 12 minutes, they went online. KARL: So bipartisanship is breaking out on Capitol Hill. Kim, you're skeptical? STRASSEL: Just to put a little bit of downer on this. I think it is amazing what we have seen so far. And yes it's all incredibly optimistic. This is the point that things become difficult. Now you're going to have language in a bill, it's going to come out. You're going to have hearings. And I think one thing to keep your eye on too is that there has been some focus on Republicans being the ones who have not been in favor of this in the past. In fact, if you go back and you look back at the legislative record, the real problem with immigration is you've had common cause within those on the right and on the left. So on the right, those who don't want immigration, on the left, often unions, for instance, who don't want a guest worker program, who don't want some of this. And you've seen Republican and Democratic members come together to poison pill some of these pieces of legislation. We don't know if that's going to come out yet. It's good news the people who are leading this, are coming out very boldly and talking as strongly as they have been. And we also don't know too what role the White House is going to play in this yet. GUTIERREZ: In the House of Representatives, I mean Raul Labrador, from Idaho, a Tea Party favorite, is leading on this issue. There are, those, I mean I remember reading, they said, well you can't put Luis Gutierrez and Raul Labrador, an extreme left and an extreme right person in the room and reach a bipartisan. I think we are going to work to reach that. Let me just also suggest, 1,400 people are deported every day. So to say that the system doesn't have an ill effect on a community and that there is no enforcement, 1,400 will be today, tomorrow, 1.6 million. It's having a devastating effect. And to just follow up on what George Will said one of the things that he didn't mention that we could act, there are millions of American citizen children, their parents are the undocumented. We need to resolve this for those children. MARCUS: And I think Kim makes a really good point but it's the reason I'm optimistic. The usual frictions between labor and business, I think have been largely resolved. The business community, small business and big business, is much more unified than it has been. I think the civil rights community, the Latino community, the White House is in a very, very pragmatic approach. They're not insisting on an instant get citizenship tomorrow or five years from now. I think the big sticking point is going to be the trigger for enforcement. What will, is this going to be bring me the witches broomstick enforcement, where you'll never be able to certify, that yes you can have this path. That's a sticking point. But I'm feeling very optimistic. KARL: Kim and Ruth are both right. KARL: Here's the thing. If we don't get the enforcement right, not just from the standpoint of what the law says but how it's going to be carried out. We haven't yet talked about for example, are we just going to rely upon the federal government? A thin group of 5,000 Enforcement Agents across this large country, to enforce the law in the future, or are we going to allow state and local law enforcement to participate in this in a way they've not been allowed to in the past. GUTIERREZ: And I think we can do them both at the same time. Look here's what I believe, the community, the Immigrant community voted, the vote on November 6. It was to say, take the 11 million and put them in a safe place. That is, stop the deportations, allow those parents to raise those children, get them right with the law. Give them a Social Security card, put them on tax role. Give up their fingerprints. Everybody keeps telling me, well Republicans, they like this more, the more they hear about background checks for the immigrants. GUTIERREZ: But that's fine. There isn't a problem. Because what immigrants are saying to me is, where do I write the check out to pay the fine? Where do I take that English class so I can get right with the law? GOODLATTE: To answer your first question to George, I think the key to this is making sure that Conservatives understand that this is an opportunity to fix a broken system and get it right. And so when we see things in the Senate bill, when we see things that the House Group of Eight are working on in a bipartisan fashion, it's been going on for years by the way. When we see them, and we don't like them, we need to say, here is how we will fix that. As opposed to here is how we will be opposed and not address this problem. KARL: I've got to move on to the other big bipartisan thing we saw this week, which was gun control. The President had, did something extraordinary over the weekend. He turned over the weekly address to Francine Wheeler, her six-year-old son Ben, was killed at Newtown. Take a listen. WHEELER: In the four months since we lost our loved ones, thousands of other Americans have died at the end of a gun. Please help us do something before our tragedy becomes your tragedy."" KARL: So the NRA actually lost a vote this week. I mean, you know, the vote, procedural vote to move forward on gun control. But doesn't the NRA still hold the cards here? STRASSEL: Well I think gun rights are, people, gun owners out in the country are what most of these senators are concerned about. And that is the problem. You talked about a bipartisan compromise, you had one Republican Senator. KARL: Yeah but Pat Toomey is not exactly a squish. I mean this isn't like (inaudible). STRASSEL: No but here's the real issue on this. What you really want, and what happened in Newtown, it's worthy of all the emotion you're seeing this week OK? But there's an obligation to do something that is effective in actually dealing with this. I think one of the problems that this amendment is going to have is that what you want is a system whereby law abiding gun owners who make up the majority of people who own guns, have the ability to go, and you help them to be able to check and use a background system, if they need to, to see and reassure themselves that they are actually selling their gun to somebody who's not a bad person. That's not what this does. This expands the current system. Government, big government reach. You're also going to be required to keep records that law enforcement is going to be able to access. STRASSEL: This (inaudible) a huge no-no of gun owners, and it's, why because they decided to go as far as they did on this amendment, that you're not likely to get both a huge number of Republicans or even a lot of Democrats, as you mentioned. WILL: It should be, as Kim says, effective. It also should be congruent with the Bill of Rights of which the Second Amendment is a part. Now, it is part of the tragedy of this tragedy is that it occurred at Sandy Hook, immediately as the President began after the election. He has spent an inordinate amount of time and energy in what will be the most precious moments of his second term probably, the early months here, on this. We're not going to get a ban on what are meretriciously called assault weapons that are simply semi-automatic weapons. WILL: Forty percent of all weapons sold in the country. We are not going to get universal background checks. We're not going to get a ban on magazines. MARCUS: I do. Will it, I do not think we're going to get assault weapon ban. MARCUS: I do not think we're going to get magazine limits. I think we're at a rather extraordinary moment where it's easier for Republican and Democratic politicians to support same sex marriage than it is for them to support the same law that was passed in 1994. None and so there, to the extent that there is the possibility and I think there is the possibility of progress. It's going to be limited progress on expanding the background check system that is already in place. Would that have prevented Newtown? No. Could that prevent future Newtowns? Yes. Will it stop everybody who's determined to buy a guy who isn't entitled to buy a guy from getting one? No. Will it stop some people? Yes. The existing background check system where if you fail your background check, you can just go buy one at a gun show has gotten two million, stopped two million transactions. Some of those people went and got other guns. That would be harder under this. But some of them didn't go and get other guns. KARL: Well what's wrong with background checks? GOODLATTE: Well first of all, the issue is, are you going to require law abiding citizens to face greater burdens to no effect. That, in my opinion, is the issue here. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There you go. KARL: It's a quick check though isn't it? I mean, two days, maximum. MARCUS: It takes seven minutes. GOODLATTE: And there's no distinction between a sale online or a sale offline. There's no sense, you can't mail a gun through the mail from somebody after they buy it from you online. You still have to go and get it from them. It's illegal to mail the gun. GOODLATTE: And then enforce the law and work to get more data in the mix. GUTIERREZ: I'll tell you who is applauding and who's clapping any lack of success on gun control, gang bangers and drug dealers across this country. They're happy and delighted. Because they are murdering and killing young people each and every day. STRASSEL: But they don't follow the law now. GOODLATTE: You think they're going to do a background check? GUTIERREZ: Yet I think it is the beginning of a conversation we need to have in America to control guns. GUTIERREZ: I need to do everything I can to ensure that another young woman like (inaudible) doesn't get murdered on the streets of Chicago. GOODLATTE: I'm all for the First Amendment conversation, but not at the expense of the Second Amendment. GUTIERREZ: But it isn't at the expense. It's at the expense of our youth, our youth in this country. MARCUS: Don't get the issue that (inaudible) and I, (inaudible) and I are both big believers in the constitution, we interpret it slightly differently. What is the infringement on Second Amendment rights to ask people to have a background check and to keep some record of that? The government is going to go rifling willy-nilly through people's files. It's going to give them ability, if there is a crime committed with the gun you've sold, to maybe go back and trace it to you. Everybody should welcome that. GOODLATTE: Can I answer that? KARL: Sure, go ahead. GOODLATTE: So we have determined that the 76,000 people who were found to have liked on the background check in 2010, 4,700 were referred by the ATF for further investigation, prosecution, 62 of them were prosecuted. Every Republican on the House Judiciary Committee signed a letter to the President and the Attorney General asking why that is? And why there isn't greater enforcement. Enforcement's down 40 percent overall in his administration. The answer we got about the background checks was those are ""paper crimes."" Well they're not paper crimes, they're felonies because they're perjury and if you set the example of lying when you do a background check and prosecuting them, you'll have fewer people trying that. But why would the solution to that be in creating more paper crimes. GUTIERREZ: And so we should enforce the law also, and also make sure that we improve the law. So I'm with you on it. So just so that we get clear, George Bush's presidency had the same dismal record on enforcement of the background checks as this presidency has during the last four years. Let's improve it together so we can improve the quality of life. GUTIERREZ: I think 9 out of 10 people in America have said we can do reasonable background checks without infringing on people's right to bear arms. KARL: We're just about out of time. I do before we leave, want to talk about this Beyonce Jay-Z, there's a serious issue about whether or not we should have a Cuba Trade Embargo, Travel Ban. Jay-Z in his response on this said, I'm in Cuba, I love Cubans. The communist talk is so confusing when it's from China, the very mic that I'm using. I mean, he has a point George. This has been an odd policy. Trade with countries that are far worse on human rights than Cuba. WILL: The Cuban Embargo may have made a lot of sense during the Cold War. The Cold War is over. And it is hard to think of a policy more firmly refuted by events than the policy of the embargo which is supposed to weaken one of the, it turns out, most durable dictators in the world. KARL: That might be something Ruth Marcus also agrees with you on. Thank you very much. MARCUS: I'm getting a little scared here. KARL: I think you to all of our roundtable. Up next, Jackie Robinson's legacy. Our conversation with the greatest relief pitcher of all time, Mariano Rivera. KIMMEL: Did you hear the latest from Iran today? The Iranian government is claiming that their scientists have developed a time machine, which could explain how their leader got all those 1980's Members Only jackets. O'BRIEN: Jay-Z and Beyonce created a controversy by traveling to Cuba. And the Treasury Department is now saying that when they OKed the request, they didn't know it was them. Yeah the Department said, yeah we thought it was a different Jay-Z and Beyonce. KARL: That was a clip from the new movie, ""42"" telling the story of Jackie Robinson breaking baseball's color barrier. Tomorrow all the Major League Players will wear Robinson's number in tribute. But there is only one play who wears the number 42 at every game, Yankee legend Mariano Rivera. We caught up with him at Yankee Stadium earlier this week. KARL: You are the last major league baseball player that will ever wear the number 42. RIVERA: Yes I have the privilege to be the last one to wear. KARL: What does that mean to you? RIVERA: It's not only privilege and satisfaction, its responsibility. I felt the challenge because what Mr. Jackie Robinson represent, what he did, and the legacy that he has, for us, you know, he lived for us. And as a minority, come from Panama and be the last one to wear number 42, I think it's a lot of pressure in there. I have tried my best. And tried to keep the responsibility and do my job well. KARL: You've done all right. RIVERA: I try, I try. KARL: I know you go out to every stadium in major league baseball, number 42 is out there, retired. RIVERA: Yes. Yes it is. KARL: And you've got it on your back. RIVERA: Yeah, the only one. The only one, I got it on my back. KARL: So are you going to see the movie? KARL: He faced so much, he had so much adversity. Some of his own teammates, most of them wouldn't even shake his hand when he came out on the field. Can you image that? RIVERA: Yeah I can't imagine that. I can't see that now. It took a man like Jackie Robinson to break that barrier. RIVERA: And Thank God for him, because we enjoy these moments now because of him. KARL: I always think of him, in the old footage, you've seen him play, stealing home. Which he did 10 times. RIVERA: I always talk to (inaudible) about that play. He say, (inaudible) he was out. They call him safe. KARL: Now before you go, I do have a favor I want to ask. KARL: You have the most famous, most effective pitch in the history of relief pitching. I want to know how do you throw the Rivera Cutter? KARL: I won't tell anybody. You can just tell me. RIVERA: It's just four things, you got the ball like this. RIVERA: And that's that. KARL: All I've got to do is grab the ball like that? RIVERA: Just like that. You throw it like that and it cut. OK you throw it like that. I will throw it like this. KARL: Wait why are you throwing it like that? RIVERA: Because I'm a (inaudible). You will throw like that. I will throw like this. RIVERA: So that's the way it works. KARL: And George Will is back with us. George you have a rare photograph of Jackie Robinson stepping onto the field moments, you know, a couple hours before his first game. That moment was big, not just for baseball, this was way beyond baseball. WILL: Well Jackie Robinson is the second most important African-American in our history. And April 15, 1947, was the most important day in the protracted, slow-motion emancipation of Africa-Americans, since the Civil War. Jackie Robinson was the fuse that lit the fire that was fanned into a conflagration by Martin Luther King who was 18 years old on that day when Jackie Robinson took the field. And by the time he took the field, three years after he, 11 years before, Rosa Parks refused to go to the back of the bus, Jackie Robinson as a Lieutenant in the Army was court martialed for refusing to go to the back of the bus in Ft. Hood, Texas and he won his case. KARL: And he was also a great baseball player. I mean how great? WILL: Well first of all, he was on a field what African-Americans had been discouraged from being in life, confident, aggressive and aristocratic. Four-star athlete, four-sport athlete at UCLA, football records, NCA champion broad jump, lead the Pacific Coast in basketball shooting. And he didn't get to the big leagues until he was 28. KARL: George Will, thank you very much. And now we honor our fellow Americans who serve and sacrifice. That's all for today. Thank you for sharing part of your Sunday with us. Check out World News with David Muir tonight and don't miss our web extra, I'll be answering your questions. Plus my interview with Yankee's slugger Robinson Cano, on the man he is named for, Jackie Robinson. It's all on abcnews.com/thisweek. George is back next week, we hope you will be too."

But as with any major new law, thereare many reasonable questions people have about how it affects themand their families.And, unfortunately, there are also many questions and concernsabout the new law based on misinformation. For example, I have beenasked a number of times why senators and their staff will not becovered by the law. The answer is, they will be. That is just oneof the many questions about the new law that I hear at my listeningsessions and from constituents.So to help answer these questions and correct some of themisinformation I hear about the bill, here are some frequentlyasked questions along with answers:I currently purchase my own insurance. Will this bill force meinto a public plan?No. The health care law does not create a public plan. If you likethe plan you purchase, the health care reform bill does not forceyou to change it.Now that the health care bill has become law, what about myhealth care coverage will change?The most immediate change as a result of the new health carereforms is that people will be able to enjoy new consumerprotections like not being dropped from coverage if you get sick,no lifetime limits on benefits and yearly caps on what insurancecompanies can charge you for out-of-pocket expenses. If you arelike the majority of Americans who get their health care coveragethrough work, you will not see any big changes. If you havespecific questions, you may want to discuss them with yourinsurance company or your employer.What will this do to the cost of my private insuranceplan?For Wisconsinites who purchase health care on the individual market(i.e., people who do not get insurance through their employer),experts believe this reform will lower premiums by 14 percent to 20percent compared to what the same plan would cost without healthcare insurance reform by 2016.If I can't afford to purchase insurance will I be fined?No. The new law includes subsidies to help individuals to purchasehealth insurance through exchanges. In the rare occasion it isstill unaffordable, even with the subsidies, you will not be fined.The law extends coverage to 32 million Americans who don't haveinsurance.Can I keep both my private insurance and my Medicare?Under the new law, anyone can keep Medicare and a privatesupplemental plan.Some people are saying that this new law would add trillions ofdollars to our debt and raise taxes on families and smallbusinesses by more than $500 billion. Is that true?The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has stated the new lawwill reduce our national deficits by $143 billion over the first 10years and as much as $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years. Thoseare the facts. Middle class families will benefit from the largestmiddle class tax cut ever by receiving subsidies to purchase healthinsurance and new consumer protections against health insuranceabuses. More than 77,000 small businesses in Wisconsin alone willbenefit from tax credits to purchase health insurance for their ownfamilies and employees.Do these new exchanges give Americans the same health carechoices as members of Congress?Yes. A number of Wisconsinites have expressed concern about theidea that members of Congress may be exempted from health carereform. I am pleased that that is not the case. Currently, membersof Congress, like other federal employees - including everyone frompostal workers to custodial staff - have access to affordableinsurance purchased through a federal exchange. The healthinsurance exchanges set up by this new law will operate in asimilar manner to make sure that all Americans in the exchangeshave access to good, affordable, health care choices. Under the newlaw, Sen. Russ Feingold and his staff will be required to purchasetheir health insurance in the new state exchanges once thoseexchanges are operating (Sec. 1312 of PPACA, pages 157 and158).How does the new law make health care affordable?Because of this new law, 541,000 Wisconsinites who are uninsuredand 320,000 Wisconsinites who purchase health insurance through theindividual market will have access to better and more affordableinsurance. Furthermore, this bill provides tax credits for up to358,000 Wisconsinites to help make health insurance moreaffordable, bringing $5.8 billion in premium and cost-sharing taxcredits into Wisconsin during the first five years of the healthinsurance exchange.Will this new law cost jobs?Actually, it could create thousands of new jobs. By slowing thegrowth rate of health care costs, it will be more profitable forbusinesses to expand employment. The state exchanges set up by thisnew law also help ensure that entrepreneurs are not prevented fromlaunching a new business because they can't afford the cost ofcare. One analysis predicts that this slowing of the growth ratewill lead to anywhere between 5,600 and 9,000 new jobs each year inWisconsin.I've been told this new law is terrible for small businesses. Isthat true?Where small businesses make up 76 percent of Wisconsin businesses,less than 38 percent of them are able to offer health insuranceright now. Because of this new law, more than 77,000 smallbusinesses in Wisconsin could receive a tax credit making healthcare coverage for employees more affordable.I keep hearing that this new law will be paid for through endingwaste, fraud and abuse in our health care system. What does thatmean?According to the non-partisan experts at the Congressional Budget Office, because ofthis new law, over the next 10 years, our national deficit willdecrease by $143 billion and up to $1.2 trillion in the following10 years. Those savings come from a number of cost-containmentprovisions. A major one is reimbursing physicians based on thequality of care they provide rather than the quantity of care. Thisis called value-based health care purchasing, and it will helpreward some of the high-quality care provided by hospitals andmedical groups around Wisconsin such as the Marshfield Clinic,Gundersen Lutheran and Franciscan Skemp.Hospitals will be held accountable to reduce preventable hospitalreadmissions and preventable health care acquired infections.Increasingly, their payments will be linked to improving theirquality and the outcomes of their care. Physicians will also bepaid based on quality of care and not on the volume of servicesthey provide. This will curb the ordering of unnecessary tests andprocedures that can be very expensive. A new Independent PaymentAdvisory Board will identify ways to lower costs, improve outcomes,promote quality and expand access to evidence-basedcare.We will also save billions over the next decade through cutting thecost of drugs purchased through Medicaid. One example is aprovision of Feingold's Control Spending Now Act, included in thenew health care bill. The government is able to purchase drugsincluded under the fee-for-service component of Medicaid at adiscounted price. The new health care law extends the ability topurchase discounted drugs to managed care organizations to providetreatment to Medicaid beneficiaries. CBO estimates this change willsave $11 billion over 10 years.I'm a Medicare beneficiary with high prescription drug costs - howdoes this new law help me?Beginning this year, if a Medicare beneficiary spends more than$2,830 on prescription drug costs in the Part D ""doughnut hole,"" heor she will receive a $250 rebate check in the mail. Starting in2011, a 50 percent discount on any brand-name drug costs incurredwhile in the doughnut hole will be available. Subsidies for genericdrug costs will also begin to be phased in starting in 2011. Thesesubsidies will increase year by year, until the doughnut hole isfully closed in 2020.My child just graduated from college and doesn't have healthinsurance. Does this new law provide any new options?Effective six months after enactment, both group health plans andplans in the individual market that provide dependent coverage forchildren must continue to make that coverage available until thechild turns 26 years of age.Who is eligible for the exchanges?The health reform bill authorizes states to create insuranceexchanges or marketplaces where small business and people who donot have coverage through their employer can shop for insurance.States may choose whether to combine these two markets (individualmarket and small group market) into one exchange, or have separateexchanges for each. Insurers will bid to sell policies in theexchanges, and must meet certain minimum requirements in terms ofbenefits and cost to participate. The exchanges will be up andrunning by 2014. Over time, states may open up the exchanges toother groups of people. Sliding scale subsidies are available toindividuals purchasing insurance through the exchange to help makeinsurance more affordable. Individuals and families with incomesbetween 133 percent and 400 percent of poverty will be eligible forthese subsidies.Premium contributions are limited to the following percentages ofincome:Up to 133 percent of poverty:2 percent of income133 to 150 percent of poverty:3 to 4 percent of income150 to 200 percent of poverty:4 to 6.3 percent of income200 to 250 percent of poverty: 6.3 to 8.05 percent of income250 to 300 percent of poverty: 8.05 to 9.5 percent of income300-400 percent of poverty: 9.5 percent of income Sign up to get each day's obituaries sent to your email inbox Sign Up!LaCrosseTribune.com ObituariesObituaries I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. .whatcounts-form-container.well { padding-bottom: 5px; } .whatcounts-form-container .left-col, .whatcounts-form-container .right-col{ float: left; width: 100%; max-width: 345px; } .whatcounts-form-container .left-col{ margin-right: 20px; } .whatcounts-form-container .whatcounts-min .left-col{ max-width: none; margin: 0; } .whatcounts-form-container .disclaimer { font-size: 13px; line-height: 14px; margin-bottom:10px; clear:both; } .whatcounts-form-container .input-group-addon.wc-addon-captcha{ padding: 4px 10px; border-left: 0; } "

GR spending for TEA was $30.3 billion, or 37 percent of all GR spending.In 2012-13, total GR spending is $81.3 billion. GR spending for TEA is $30.5 billion, or 37.4 percent of all GR spending.In addition, $1.9 billion was deferred into the early days of the next biennium (2014-15). Schools know that they will receive this money in early September and often plan as if it is part of their 2012-13 budget. In fact, the Legislature could decide early in the next session, given recent revenue growth, to put that payment back into August 2013.If you count that deferral as part of 2012-13 spending, which we believe many school officials would consider reasonable, then GR spending for TEA is $32.4 billion, or 38.9 percent of all GR spending.

(AP)Donald Trump’s presidential campaign was forced to address a widespread allegation of hypocrisy this week, and it had nothing to do with his former liberal ways or his company’s overseas investments.Much worse. Social media posts claimed his unmistakable, sometimes ironically worn "" Make America Great Again "" hats are not made in the USA.Here’s an example from Twitter , which was picked up by Occupy Democrats on Facebook:Made in China?! Say it ain’t so, Donald.Hold onto your plastic snap enclosure. It’s not true.The hat that launched a barrage of snarky social media posts after its July debut at a Texas campaign event has also launched a host of imitations.""The image you shared is not an official campaign product,"" Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told PunditFact in an email. ""All product for sale on DonaldJTrump.com is made in the USA.""Hicks confirmed a couple of other facts about the authentic Trump campaign hat, sold for $25-$30 in patriotic and camouflage shades at the campaign store.The hats are made by Cali Fame of Los Angeles, which makes the Cali Headwear brand. Trump’s hat is based on the Patriot 5 model , and no surprise, it’s been a bestseller this year, though not a bestseller of all time. Cali Headwear co-owner Brian Kennedy told us that hats his company made for Von Dutch and Ed Hardy sold better.Oh, and they are made in the USA.Kennedy’s company, which his family has owned since 1977, has been making this style since the 1970s. Trump has been wearing it and selling it on his golf courses for years, but it’s been big with the hipster market since the summer (well, so has the "" dad hat ,"" he said).""It’s just the same old story that what goes around comes around,"" Kennedy told us by phone from inside his factory, machines whirring in the background.""But there’s news every day on the hat,"" he added.From there, the hats are distributed by Ace Specialties LLC, a Lafayette, La., company that normally deals with gear for the oil and gas industry.Ace Specialties president and owner Christl Mahfouz said she had seen a similar meme on Facebook, ""and that’s not even his hat.""""Definitely everything on our side is made in the USA,"" said Mahfouz, who is also on the board of the Eric Trump Foundation, the philanthropy started by one of Trump’s sons for children with terminal illness.A few years back, before he entered politics as a candidate, there was more truth to claims that Trump gear was not made in America.Former Late Show host David Letterman brought out a number of buttoned shirts and slick ties from the Trump brand clothing line for Macy’s (which dumped him after his fiery statements about Mexicans in July) in a 2011 interview.Letterman pointed out that his ties and shirts were made in China, according to the label. At the time, Trump was supporting Republican Mitt Romney for president and had been accusing China of taking American manufacturing jobs.Trump smirked as the crowd cheered before he defended himself, saying ""it’s very hard to get product that’s not made in China"" because of the country’s currency manipulation.Our rulingTweets aim to paint Trump as a hypocrite for hawking ""Make America Great Again"" hats with ""Made in China"" labels from his campaign store.Those hats are knockoffs. Trump has even trademarked the phrase ""Make America Great Again."" Trump’s hats are made by a California company that says they are, indeed, American made.We rate the claim Pants on Fire!Advertisement"

One refers to the Prophet Mohammed as a ""Cult leader for a small inner circle."" Another says Mohammed ""ordered the assassinations and executions of his critics."" One after another, the phrases depict Islam, its writings and leaders, as violent and bent on conquest. What's even more startling: These passages were written by an FBI analyst, they were shown as part of a training program for agents, and the author believes mainstream Muslims believe all this, not just the extremist wing. The phrases are in slide presentations given to FBI agents at the bureau's training facility in Quantico, Virginia. They were written by an FBI analyst. The slides were first posted by Wired magazine, which says it received them from ""FBI whistle blowers."" At the beginning of the presentation, there is a disclaimer: ""The views expressed in this presentation are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of any entity of the United States government."" Then, in a section entitled ""Strategic Themes and Drivers in Islamic Law,"" it lays out ideas the author attributes to Mohammed and mainstream Muslims that often seem like they're in a jihadist manifesto. One section lays out ""Just War"" principles of Islam, which claims Muslims believe ""War is the rule and peace is only temporary."" Another section describes ""Mohammed's Quran"" as saying ""I will send terror into the unbelievers' hearts, cut off their heads and even the tips of their fingers."" One slide says Islam's ""World View"" is that there can be no peace between Islam and others ""...until dar al Islam conquers and assimilates its adversary."" James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute and an Islamic scholar, says of the reference to the Prophet Mohammed as a ""cult leader"": ""It's horrific to say that. Is Jesus a cult leader? I mean, one does not do that and be respectful to the faith of people. It certainly doesn't correspond to what the reality of Islam is."" Zogby also refutes the characterization that Mohammed ordered the assassinations of his critics. ""Yes, there were people who he in fact was opposed to. And yes, there was a conflict that was going on, a war that was going on in the Arabian peninsula at the time. But to put it that way makes it sound as if he is organizing hit squads to go after the opposition. That's not what the story line was about."" The author of the training presentation writes, of some of these extreme and violent beliefs: ""The strategic themes animating these Islamic values are not fringe; they are mainstream."" That drew a passionate response from Zogby. ""I say this is the propaganda of the Islamophobes,"" Zogby said. ""This is what they've been preaching. This is why they've been stopping the building of mosques. They want to paint an entire community - an entire faith community - as extremist and radical and violent and prone to violence. It's bigotry of the worst sort."" Contacted by CNN, the FBI would not comment on Zogby's remarks. FBI spokesman Christopher M. ""This particular training segment was conducted six months ago, one time only, at Quantico and was quickly discontinued. The instructor who conducted that training block no longer provides training on behalf of the FBI. Policy changes have been under way to better ensure that all training is consistent with FBI standards. These changes will help develop appropriate training content for new agent training and continuing education for all employees, as well as introduce a robust consultative element from experts outside the FBI."" Allen told CNN the person who wrote the presentation is an FBI analyst, not an agent. Though the person was removed from training programs, Allen said he still works at the bureau as an analyst. Asked by CNN whether the analyst was or will be disciplined, Allen said he could not comment on personnel matters. CNN asked to interview the analyst and that request was denied. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the FBI has often invited Muslim leaders to speak to agents and has conducted several outreach programs with the American Muslim community. Tom Fuentes, a former FBI Assistant Director and a CNN National Security contributor, said the FBI and other law enforcement agencies want to expose students to a wide array of ideas and beliefs during training. Asked if he thinks FBI counterterror agents believe mainstream Muslims are that extreme, Fuentes said ""No, they don't believe it. And they furthermore believe strenuously in a strong outreach program."" But Fuentes said he does worry about the implications of that particular training session and the fact that it has been made public. ""It would play into anybody's hands who is trying to diminish the FBI or the U.S. government's ability to establish cooperation in Muslim communities. So by its nature, if someone in the community sees or hears something suspicious and feels that they cannot cooperate with the FBI or other agencies, they may not. And that would make it more dangerous."" But Fuentes is hopeful that the fact that the FBI acted so quickly to pull the program ""may give the FBI more credibility"" with Muslim leaders.

In FY2013-14 the City gave all employees a 1.5% raise and an additional flat $750 raise. So if you were making $50,000; that came out to be a 3% raise. If you were making $100,000; that was still like getting a 2.25% increase. If you were making $250,000; that would be a 1.8% increase. …I find it interesting that the BLS has different Data Sets: QCEW vs OES. One quick observation, the average annual wage numbers are very different between the 2 data sets:Year Reasons we were comfortable using the OES Data:· The City of Austin has a wide range of occupations from attorneys, to engineers, to librarians, etc. that if the City of Austin wants to do a peanut butter spread base wage increase, that the “All Occupations” in the OES Data would best represent what that wage increase should be.· It allowed us to use the Median instead of the Mean. We wanted to know what the raise at the 50 percentile was. Sometimes the Mean can be skewed if you have outliers at either end.· City of Austin consists mainly of Travis County, but it also has parts of Hays County and Williamson County. See below inline responses in Red to your questions. Let us know if you have any further questions.Thanks.Office of Councilman Don ZimmermanDistrict 6, Northwest AustinSent: Monday, September 21, 2015 7:20 PMTo: Petronis, JoeCc: Zimmerman, DonSubject: Following up, information attached, for fact check of the claim about other workers in Austin not getting 3 percent raises in recent years Hello again. I’m following up to make sure I am accurately describing the data you shared and to run what others have said to us by you. I am interested in any further comments or analysis. Joe emailed us a spreadsheet citing U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment Statistics, drawn from employers in all industry sectors, to indicate that within the five-county area centered on Travis County, the average annual change in wages from 2010 through 2014 across all occupations at the median salary--meaning half of all workers earned more, half less--was 1.6 percent. Am I right that workers earning the median wage in the region, according to the OES figures, saw a collective 0.5 percent drop in wages in 2012, a 2.1 increase in 2013 and a 0.8 percent rise in 2014? – Yes, that is what the OES data shows. Beverly Kerr, a researcher with the Austin Chamber of Commerce, pointed out to us that the BLS advises against using its OES figures to compare figures from different years. The bureau’s explanation appears in question F. 1. here . Did Council Member Zimmerman draw on any other data source? Other thoughts? – Looking at F1; I don’t think the challenges that they outline effect what we did. We looked at the All Occupations data for the Austin area from 2009-2014. Reading F1, I view it as impacting specific occupations, but not the All Occupations. Also, if we were looking at 20 years’ worth of data it may have some wrinkles. Most of the changes in the data they mention were from 2002. Since some employees view the peanut butter raise as a Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA), we briefly looked at the Social Security COLA. However we decided against it since it covers all the US. OES was the data set that we used. Kerr also offered up another data source, the bureau’s Current Employment Statistics, which she said show that annual private industry wages increased in the five-county Austin region went up by an average 2.2 percent from 2008 through 2014 with average annual raises ranging from 1.3 percent to 4.8 percent. – I am not as familiar with this data. Since Travis County and Austin has a large number of non-private industry I am not sure this would be the best set. I assume the “Total All” covers both Private and Government jobs.Travis County is home to 74 percent of the five-county region’s jobs, Kerr advised. Like Kelsey and Abbot, Kerr used the bureau’s QCEW data to estimate average pay raises for individuals employed in the county. In 2014, according to this data, the $1,113 average weekly wage for private-sector workers in the county was up 3.8 percent from $1,072 in 2013, compared to an average annual decrease of 0.1 percent in 2013 and an average increase of 3.3 percent in 2012. Meantime, Brian Kelsey told us that according to the another BLS data set, the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, average annual pay across all industries in Travis County increased by 3.7 percent in 2014, from $52,276 to $54,190. The census, which originated in the 1930s, tracks employment and wages of establishments which report to the federal government’s unemployment insurance programs , representing about 97 percent of the nation’s civilian wage and salary civilian employment. – We did not look at this data set. Also, we looked at the median wage increase, not the average. The average annual wages are very different in QCEW vs. OES.From: Selby, Gardner (CMG-Austin)Sent: Tuesday, September 22, 2015 6:24 PMTo: Petronis, JoeSubject: RE: Following up, information attached, for fact check of the claim about other workers in Austin not getting 3 percent raises in recent years You write: “We wanted to know what the raise at the 50 percentile was.” Can you elaborate? Why those particular workers as opposed to all workers?9:42 a.m.Sept. 23, 2015I did not assume that the OES data set for wages was “normally distributed”. So if you have people at the extremes (either making a lot of money or very little), that can skew average. Going with the median shows the point where 50% of the people are making above and 50% of the people are making below that number. So when looking at the increase in wages, if the people at the lower end of the spectrum are growing at a slower pace than the rest of the data set or conversely if the people at the higher end of the spectrum are growing at a faster pace than the rest of the data set; then the “average” increase would be skewed. If you look at what the wages for the person at the 50% mark are doing, that should remove some of the “noise” associated with the extremes.

It would lift the mandate that Americans have insurance, change the subsidies that help some pay for it, and cause the number of people with coverage to plunge by as much as 23 million over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.But the aspects that have generated the most political friction, and that might affect the most people, in New York are those dealing with Medicaid. The government insurance program expanded its reach under the Affordable Care Act and now covers nearly one in three New Yorkers. Pending bills in Congress would cut or cap New York's Medicaid funding in four separate ways. Jason Helgerson, the state's Medicaid director, told the Times Herald-Record last week that he estimates those changes, once fully phased in, could cost the state as much as $8 billion or $9 billion a year, for a program that costs $65.5 billion this year.The result is a sharp debate over Medicaid's role and cost and the effect that ""Trumpcare"" would have on its beneficiaries and on hospitals in New York.Helgerson argues the cuts would reverse coverage gains New York has made and have a devastating effect on upstate hospitals and the local economies they support. ""Medicaid is the biggest payer of health care services in New York,"" he said, arguing that reducing that funding would force hospitals to lay off employees or even close. In rural areas where those operations are the largest employers, the impact could trigger a ripple effect on the economy, Helgerson said.Rep. John Faso, the Republican freshman whose district includes Ulster and Sullivan counties, has been prominent in the debate because of a bill amendment he sponsored that would force New York to stop requiring its counties outside New York City to shoulder part of the Medicaid expenses. He argues that the federal government must slow Medicaid's spending growth because the current pace is ""not sustainable,"" and that New York would adjust to the changes without the dire consequences that Gov. Andrew Cuomo and other critics predict.But he also suggests the Medicaid program itself has grown beyond its original purpose and now covers more people than it should.""We now have about one third of New York's population on Medicaid,"" Faso said. ""Some people in Albany may look upon that as an accomplishment. I look upon that as a failure.""Local impactFrom Warwick to Woodstock, from Newburgh to Callicoon, households and a variety of institutions rely on Medicaid to pay for costly services.It pays for child births and dental care and diabetes drugs in densely populated areas where poverty is concentrated, places like Newburgh and Kiryas Joel, but also in largely rural areas like Sullivan County, where one in three residents is enrolled in Medicaid.It pays for services for people with disabilities, such as children with autism at the Center for Spectrum Services in Kingston and Ellenville.It is a primary funding source for the elderly and infirm living in 21 nursing homes with 3,100 total beds in Orange, Ulster and Sullivan counties.It pays for addiction treatment in the midst of a national heroin and prescription pill epidemic.Frank Petrucci, a 28-year-old Warwick resident who suffers from a rare, debilitating disease, relies on Medicaid to pay the $50,000 bill each time he goes to the hospital for an intravenous drug treatment to prevent his condition from getting worse, at intervals of six weeks or two months. Without those treatments, the disease is likely to progress and make him more and more incapacitated, taking away his ability to take care of himself, drive and work part-time. A national rower before his ailment set in, Petrucci coaches several times a week at the East Arm Rowing Club in Greenwood Lake. Whether and how a reduction in Medicaid funding would affect his coverage is uncertain. Petrucci, who has closely watched the legislative debate as it unfolds in Washington, said he's covered now because of his low income. If the state is forced to curtail eligibility for his income level, could he qualify instead because of his disability? Would he have to allow his condition to worsen without treatment until he was disabled enough? Would the wait for disability coverage require him to go even longer without treatment?""If that's removed, then my world becomes a smaller place,"" Petrucci said, referring to the loss of mobility he would likely suffer.What he knows for sure is that he's an expensive patient and probably will remain so for many years. ""I'm young, and this disease is most likely a lifelong disease,"" he said.Heated debateThe amendment Faso sponsored with Rep. Chris Collins would force the state to absorb the $2.3 billion that 57 counties now spend on Medicaid or else cut that amount from its spending. Faso argues that imposing a cost share on New York's counties when Medicaid began 51 years ago was a bad mistake, one that now helps drive up property taxes and cause residents to leave New York. Shifting the counties' expense to Albany is ""restoring responsibility,"" he said.Faso contends the state could shoulder that responsibility by cutting waste and fraud from Medicaid and other unnecessary state spending. He dismissed Cuomo's contention that the state might recover the lost revenue from its counties in some other manner, saying the Legislature would never approve it.""It's time for him to man up and do what 49 other governors have done,"" Faso said.On a broader level, Faso said that increased dependence on Medicaid is ""not a desirable thing,"" and that government should be ""striving to get people into private insurance.""""It was not meant to be an insurance policy for able-bodied adults,"" he said.Helgerson counters that at a time when fewer employers give their workers health insurance, Medicaid has helped the state cut its rate of uninsured residents in half, a feat it celebrates without apology.""Does Congressman Faso want to double the uninsured rate in New York?"" he asked.Bill Hammond, director of health policy for the Albany-based Empire Center for Public Policy, said he sympathizes with Republicans' quest to control Medicaid spending, which he said is ""growing faster than our ability to pay."" He also agreed with Faso that New York's Medicaid program contains a ""fairly large amount of waste"" - as any public or private insurance program does.But he pointed out that cutting Medicaid spending to absorb the county costs would have a double impact, since the state would then lose a dollar-for-dollar amount in federal funding. And he argued that the legislation under debate in Washington would have to offer Medicaid enrollees enough financial support for private insurance to make that a ""reasonable alternative.""""It's just unreasonable for them to find a couple thousand dollars a year to buy health insurance,"" Hammond said.Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, the Cold Spring Democrat whose district includes Orange County, argues that Republicans undermined their rationale for cutting Medicaid spending growth as a fiscal necessity by proposing to eliminate two taxes on high-income earners in the same legislation. Their position would have more integrity, he said, if the savings had been used to balance the budget.""This whole thing is a scheme to cut taxes for the rich,"" he said.Maloney applauded the drop in New York's uninsured rate - to 4.5 percent from 9.5 percent - and said 55,000 people in his district alone had gotten coverage through the Medicaid expansion.""Maybe John Faso thinks too many people have health care,"" he said. ""I don't.""cmckenna@th-record.comChoose the plan that's right for you.Digital access or digital and print delivery."

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)The morning after President Donald Trump announced Judge Neil Gorsuch as his nominee to fill the vacant seat on the U.S. Supreme Court, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., appeared on MSNBC’s Morning Joe to share his thoughts about the president’s pick.Durbin, the Democratic whip and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in the interview he believes Gorsuch should have a hearing, but that the nominee also should meet the required voting standard.""(Gorsuch) should have a hearing and he should meet the voting standard that Supreme Court nominees are held to of 60 votes. A standard that was met by Elena Kagan as well as Sonia Sotomayor, President Obama's choices,"" Durbin told the show’s hosts.With Senate Republicans considering the so-called ""nuclear option"" to lower the vote threshold needed to confirm Gorsuch, we decided to double-check Durbin’s declaration.Durbin has a point, but he does oversimplifies the process for Senate votes on Supreme Court nominees. Notably, a formal confirmation vote does not require 60 votes.Voting standard?Of the nearly 4,000 government positions Trump must fill, 1,212 require a Senate confirmation.That includes all Cabinet-level posts as well as hundreds of other senior positions and agency heads.Here’s how the confirmation process will work for Gorsuch: He will testify in a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. If the committee refers his nomination to the full Senate (a likely outcome due to the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee), a vote by the full Senate needs to be taken. The Senate majority leader moves to take the Senate into an executive session, the setting in which nominees are confirmed, according to Worth Hester, the assistant director of the Georgetown Government Affairs Institute.Then, the Senate majority leader needs to bring a nominee to a vote by the full Senate. In Gorsuch’s case, barring any outstanding circumstances, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will either get unanimous consent , a process by which every senator agrees to schedule a vote on a nominee. However, if unanimous consent cannot be reached, and if at least one senator filibusters, Sen. McConnell would need to invoke cloture.A ""cloture vote,"" agrees to place a time limit on the consideration of a nominee. A successful cloture requires 60 votes. After the cloture vote, Senate rules allow for 30 additional hours of debate, and then a final confirmation vote occurs, according to Sarah Binder, political scientist at George Washington University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.This confirmation process for some positions became less burdensome thanks to a rule change on Nov. 21, 2013.With the Senate’s Republican minority blocking President Barack Obama’s nominees for executive branch positions and, in particular, appeals court judges, then-Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., triggered the so-called nuclear option by a successful 52-48 vote, eliminating the 60-vote threshold needed to confirm most nominations, and with it, the threat of a filibuster.The rule change, however, excluded Supreme Court nominees, meaning that such nominations could be filibustered. And that’s something that some Democrats have threatened to do against the Gorsuch nomination. The Republicans currently hold 52 seats in the Senate -- enough to reach the final vote threshold of 51 votes, but only if they can get that far.Now that we’ve addressed some background information about the nuclear option and current situation at hand, let’s take a look at Durbin’s claim.Nomination and confirmation of Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena KaganFollowing the election of Obama in November 2008, Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress and essentially held 59 seats in the Senate because two independents caucused with them.In May 2009, Obama nominated U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Sonia Sotomayor of New York for the Supreme Court to replace retiring Justice David Souter.Senate Judiciary Committee hearings began on June 1 of that year, and Sotomayor was confirmed by a vote of 68-31 on Aug. 6.Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts did not vote. He died on Aug. 25 -- 15 months after being diagnosed with brain cancer. If Kennedy had been present for the vote, Senate Democrats would have had a filibuster-proof majority. But that didn’t matter because nine Republicans voted to confirm Sotomayor.Then almost exactly one year later, Obama’s nominee to replace retiring Justice John Paul Stevens, U.S. Solicitor General Elena Kagan, was confirmed by the Senate on Aug. 6 in a 63-37 vote, with five Republicans voting in favor and one Democrat, former Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, voting against.During the confirmation of both Sotomayor and Kagan, Democrats had a comfortable majority that was near filibuster-proof if not for the absence of Kennedy in August 2009 and the lone dissenting Democratic vote by Nelson in August 2010.On the surface, the margins achieved by Sotomayor and Kagan would seem to support Durbin’s argument that the confirmations required 60 votes. However, it’s more complicated than that. The nominations were never filibustered, so no 60-vote cloture motion was required. And the final confirmation required only 51 votes. In fact, two sitting justices -- Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas -- never reached 60 votes in their final tally.The key word that trips up Durbin is ""standard."" The existing Senate ""standard"" says nothing about reaching 60 votes. If the standard for passing a class is earning a C, and someone gets a B, it doesn’t mean that a B was required to pass the class. The ""standard"" to pass the class is still a C.Whether this longstanding standard lasts into the future, given the degree of polarization in Congress today, is another question entirely.Our ratingIn an interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe show, Durbin said Obama’s nominees met a standard of 60 votes, ""a standard that was met by Elena Kagan as well as Sonia Sotomayor, President Obama's choices.""Obama’s nominees cleared the procedural hurdles and won 60 votes and then some. The Senate confirmed Kagan by a roll call vote of 63-37 in 2010, and Sotomayor was confirmed in 2009 by a vote of 68-31 .Kagan and Sotomayor ultimately would have had enough votes to be able to break a filibuster, but they never had to -- and the margins they got on the final, simple-majority vote can’t be used to retroactively define what the ""standard"" was.We rate the statement Half True.Share the Facts"

Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. “We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there’s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting”, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. “They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal”, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. “Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern”, said Dr. Polowotski. “Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution”. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. “We were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it”, said Bob. “We were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow. But something like this really does make you stop and think”, he said. DNR officials removed the animal from the beach and took it to an undisclosed location for further study.2New Laws in VA to Ban Hiding ""painted rocks"" in Public Spaces A new law goes into effect September 1st 2017 that will essentially make it a misdemeanor to paint rocks.
