Even after increasing taxes by nearly $2 trillion, Barack Obama will somehow manage to add more than $8 trillion to the national debt, which is more debt than the 43 presidents who held office before him compiled together.As a result of the reckless spending in Washington, a child born today like my new grandson, Jack, comes into the world with nearly $60,000 of debt on his or her back.The next president of the United States must tackle the spending and debt crisis., and leadership starts with being honest with the American people.In 1965, health care programs and Social Security spending consumed less than a sixth of Washington’s budget. Today, they consume almost half of federal spending and are crowding out investments in national defense, roads and bridges, law enforcement and other national priorities. The retirement of the baby boom generation and the aging of America is exacerbating the problem. Consider that in 1950, there were 16 workers paying taxes into Social Security for every senior collecting benefits. Today the ratio is 3 to 1 and it will fall to 2 to 1 in a few short years.The status quo isn’t sustainable, and unless the next president and Congress, honestly address entitlement reform, today’s seniors and future retirees could face massive benefit cuts of as much as 25 percent. I believe we should act now rather than inflict this level of pain on seniors. Of all the candidates running for president, I have put forward the most detailed plans to preserve and protect Social Security and Medicare.As the former governor of Florida, the state with one of the largest senior populations in the country, I understand and respect how important Social Security and Medicare are to ensuring a comfortable retirement for the American people. I would never do anything to weaken these programs or break the promise that has been made to workers who pay into Social Security and Medicare. The reform plan I have released would extend the solvency of the Social Security trust fund for 75 years, ensuring that today’s seniors and the next generation of retirees are protected.Given the fact that we are living longer and healthier lives, it is only prudent that we increase the retirement age in a responsible way. Today’s seniors and those close to retiring would receive no change in the eligibility age for Social Security. But for younger people, we need to gradually increase the retirement age from 67 to 70. I also believe that we should make it easier for seniors who want to continue to work to do so. My plan would eliminate the payroll tax on seniors at age 67 to encourage more people to continue participating in the workforce. I would also reform the benefit structure to ensure that the minimum Social Security benefit is set at 150 percent of the poverty line. Today, the minimum benefit falls below the poverty threshold. This is wrong and I am committed to providing low-income seniors with a level of benefits that ensures they can live a life of dignity in retirement. I would pay for this reform and extend the solvency of the Social Security trust fund by means-testing benefits for wealthy seniors who have ample personal retirement savings.Regarding Medicare, I believe the best way to reform the system is to open it up to more competition.If seniors want to continue participating in traditional Medicare that option should be preserved for them, but we should also give seniors the right to choose from a menu of high quality private plans that may offer benefit packages that are more attractive. As a conservative, I believe deeply in the power of competition to deliver positive change. I have seen it time and again in my 32 years in the private sector, and I know it will work for Medicare as well. Finally, to better shore up Medicare’s finances, I would also apply greater means testing for wealthier seniors.Liberals like Hillary Clinton are not being honest with the American people about the impending crisis in Social Security and Medicare. They want the American people to believe that doing nothing is a viable option. To ensure that seniors and future retirees can receive Social Security and Medicare benefits that provide them with peace of mind during their retirement years, we must be bold and courageous and tell the truth to the American people. My plan does that and when I am president of the United States I will work to bring Republicans and Democrats together around solutions that preserve and protect Social Security and Medicare.	1

Chris Christie, in Mexico this week on a trade mission, has been bedeviled by downgrades of New Jersey's credit rating this year. (Ed Murray/The Star-Ledger)commentsTRENTON — Wall Street analysts at Fitch Ratings today downgraded New Jersey's bond rating for the second time this year, citing the state's poor economic performance, Gov. Chris Christie's rosy revenue forecasts — which failed to materialize — and his decision to plug the resulting budget gap by cutting $2.4 billion in funding for the state's strained pension system.Fitch said Christie's decision to cut the pension payments this year marked a ""repudiation"" of a bipartisan plan he signed to fix the beleaguered retirement system for public workers, which is underfunded by nearly $40 billion, according to state estimates.Instead of pumping bigger cash infusions every year into workers' retirement accounts to save them from collapse — as Christie and lawmakers agreed to do in his first term — New Jersey is now stepping away from its plan, Fitch said.""Following significant revenue underperformance, the state relied upon the repudiation of its statutory contribution requirements to the pension systems to return to budgetary balance, exacerbating a key credit weakness,"" the Fitch analysts wrote in a note to investors , lowering their rating on the state's debt from A+ to A.Fitch previously downgraded New Jersey by one step in May, while Christie was negotiating the new $32.5 billion budget with the Democrats who control the Legislature, which took effect July 1. Today's downgrade means the Wall Street analysts did not like the finished product, calling it a return to one-shot budget Band-Aids and ""extremely narrow financial reserves.""""New Jersey's economic performance continues to lag that of the nation and a multitude of long-term spending demands are expected to prolong the achievement of sound financial operations,"" the analysts wrote. Fitch is keeping a ""negative outlook"" for New Jersey, meaning an upgrade of the state's credit rating is unlikely.Throughout the year, downgrades have bedeviled Christie, a Republican who says he is thinking of running for president in 2016 and is visiting Mexico this week on a trade mission. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's also issued ratings cuts during the budget season.Every time the rating goes lower, the state's borrowing costs for major projects such as schools and road upgrades are likely to increase. Today's downgrade marked the seventh time the state's rating was cut under Christie's watch, the most under any New Jersey governor.A spokesman for the state Treasury Department said Christie ""acted responsibly"" by shrinking two pension payments that had been scheduled for the current and previous fiscal years.""Without raising taxes on an already overburdened populace, Governor Christie has already contributed more to the pension system than any previous governor,"" said the Treasury spokesman, Chris Santarelli, in an emailed statement.""As rating agencies and ratings expectations have been recalibrated following the financial crisis of the late 2000s, the state Treasury and Office of Public Finance have worked tirelessly to ensure that New Jersey is rated fairly and equally by the Wall Street rating agencies; and will continue to do so.""After state tax collections fell far behind Christie's estimates in April, the governor said he decided to short the pension payments instead of making last-minute budget cuts to hospitals, schools and other parts of the social safety net. The two-year budget gap was north of $2 billion.Christie's funding cuts for the pension system sparked a flurry of lawsuits that are ongoing in state Superior Court. This week, lawyers for the governor said he cannot be forced to keep making bigger payments , despite signing laws in 2010 and 2011 that pledged those contributions.Santarelli added that there have been signs of improvement in the state's economic picture over the summer, such as ""steady revenues and growing employment numbers.""""New Jersey needs additional, long-term, fiscally sustainable solutions to address the state’s considerable debt obligations and significant unfunded retirement liabilities,"" he added. The governor has convened a special task force of pension experts to study ways to dig New Jersey out of its deepening hole. ""We invite the Legislature to join the governor in taking responsible action to meet this paramount challenge to our long-term fiscal health.""Fitch analysts took a less optimistic view. ""New Jersey benefits from a wealthy populace and a broad and diverse economy,"" they wrote. ""However, the state's economic performance has lagged the nation in recovery from the recent recession, with improvement in 2013 trailing off at the close of the year, and very slow year over year ... employment growth continuing through 2014.""The state is also carrying a high debt load at a time when ""demands for school construction, environmental protection and transportation remain large,"" they added. ""Net tax-supported debt as of June 30, 2014 equaled 7.4 percent of 2013 personal income as compared to a median of 2.6 percent for the states,"" Fitch said.FOLLOW STAR-LEDGER POLITICS: TWITTER • FACEBOOK • GOOGLE+Most Read"	0

I will nominate judges who will look to the text, original understanding, history, and structure of the Constitution for answers — not to their own views about public policy, to the popular opinion of the moment, or to what might win favor on liberal newspaper editorial pages. They will defer to the elected branches on issues where the Constitution is silent. But when laws conflict with the Constitution, they will not hesitate to strike them down.I believe the federal courts are at a crossroads. The next president will help to determine whether we move further away from constitutional government, or correct course. We cannot afford to elect a president who will pack the courts with ‘politicians in robes’ who subvert the law to advance their own political agendas. We need a president who will nominate individuals with a record of respecting the difference between judges and legislators — which is exactly what I pledge to do.I have a proven record of appointing conservatives to the Florida judiciary as governor, and my administration devoted substantial time to vetting nominees. We sought judges who had shown humility, courage, an appreciation of the duties of a judge, a respect for the will of the people, and devotion to full application of the law without equivocation. My two appointments to the Florida Supreme Court, Raoul Cantero and Kenneth Bell, have earned reputations as its most consistent conservatives. Additionally, two of the appellate judges I named as governor, Charles Canady and Ricky Polston, are now serving with distinction on the Florida Supreme Court.I will approach nominations to the federal courts and the U.S. Supreme Court with the same rigor and care. My strategy is to assemble the broadest possible pool of candidates who meet the core qualifications, scour their records and vet their references. Only those people with a history of respecting both the limits of government power and the will of the people will stay on the list. The final criterion will be to identify those most willing to stand up for the law, even when it runs contrary to their own ideology.If our court system continues in the wrong direction, we face a troubling future. Our strong tradition of religious liberty, which is already under assault, could erode precipitously. The right to bear arms could be read out of our Constitution. Judicial fiat could end school-choice programs that have given hope to children across our country. The states could be reduced to mere administrative sub-units of the federal government. Liberal dogma could block reasonable protections for unborn children, even when most people agree on them.So, this is my promise: I will fight for the confirmation of my judicial nominees. They will all have a long, clear conservative record. Opposition from Senate Democrats is all but guaranteed. I am eager to fight for good judges, to make the case in the court of public opinion, and I am confident that those of us who believe in judicial fidelity to the Constitution will win the battle.Read more on Jeb2016.com .	1

He outlined his tax plan , including how he’d cut corporate taxe s. Below you can read the full transcript of the speech, entitled “An America First Economic Plan: Winning the Global Competition.”Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today. It’s wonderful to be in Detroit. We now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for America. It’s a conversation about how to Make American Great Again for everyone, and especially those who have the very least.The City of Detroit Is Where Our Story BeginsDetroit was once the economic envy of the world. The people of Detroit helped power America to its position of global dominance in the 20th century.When we were governed by an America First policy, Detroit was booming. Engineers, builders, laborers, shippers and countless others went to work each day, provided for their families, and lived out the American Dream.But for many living in this city, that dream has long ago vanished.When we abandoned the policy of America First, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own. The skyscrapers went up in Beijing, and in many other cities around the world, while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled in Detroit. Our roads and bridges fell into disrepair, yet we found the money to resettle millions of refugees at taxpayer expense.Today, Detroit has a per capita income of under $15,000 dollars, about half of the national average. 40 percent of the city’s residents live in poverty, over two-and-half times the national average. The unemployment rate is more than twice the national average. Half of all Detroit residents do not work.Detroit tops the list of Most Dangerous Cities in terms of violent crime – these are the silenced victims whose stories are never told by Hillary Clinton, but victims whose suffering is no less real or permanent.In short, the city of Detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent’s failed economic agenda. Every policy that has failed this city, and so many others, is a policy supported by Hillary Clinton.She supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your community…and the crime policies that have made you less safe…and the immigration policies that have strained local budgets…and the trade deals like NAFTA, signed by her husband, that have shipped your jobs to Mexico and other countries… and she supports the education policies that deny your students choice, freedom and opportunity.For more on Donald Trump, watch this Fortune video:She is the candidate of the past.Ours is the campaign of the future.This is a city controlled by Democratic politicians at every level, and unless we change policies, we will not change results.Today, I will outline my economic vision. In the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies, and the ones we have already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign website.Our opposition, on the other hand, has long ago run out of ideas. All Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same: more taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy and American production.If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn’t do better than Hillary Clinton’s economic agenda.Nothing would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs out of existence.The one common feature of every Hillary Clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States. Every policy she has tilts the playing field towards other countries at our expense.That’s why she tries to distract us with tired political rhetoric that seeks to label us, divide us, and pull us apart.My campaign is about reaching out to everyone as Americans, and returning to a government that puts the American people first.Here is what an America First economic plan looks like.First, let’s talk tax reform.Taxes are one of the biggest differences in this race.Hillary Clinton – who has spent her career voting for tax increases – plans another massive job-killing $1.3 trillion-dollar tax increase. 9 Her plan would tax many small businesses by almost fifty percent.Recently, at a campaign event, Hillary Clinton short-circuited again – to use a now famous term – when she accidentally told the truth and said she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class.I am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans. This will lead to millions of new good-paying jobs.The rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs, or undermines our ability to compete.As part of this reform, we will eliminate the Carried Interest Deduction and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for WallStreet investors, and people like me, but unfair to American workers.Read more: Don’t Go Looking for Trump’s Tax Plan–It’s a Dead LinkTax simplification will be a major feature of the plan.Our current tax code is so burdensome and complex that we waste 9 billion hours a year in tax code compliance. My plan will reduce the current number of brackets from 7 to 3, and dramatically streamline the process. We will work with House Republicans on this plan, using the same brackets they have proposed: 12, 25 and 33 percent. For many American workers, their tax rate will be zero.While we will develop our own set of assumptions and policies, agreeing in some areas but not in others, we will be focused on thesame shared goals and guided by the same shared principles: jobs, growth and opportunity.These reforms will offer the biggest tax revolution since the Reagan Tax Reform, which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creation.We will Make America Grow Again.In the days ahead, we will provide more details on this plan and how it will help you and your family. It will present a night-and-day contrast to the job-killing, tax-raising, poverty-inducing Obama-Clinton agenda.The State of New York has already lived through Hillary Clinton’s failed leadership. The Washington Post just published a devastating article on Hillary Clinton’s broken promises. She pledged 200,000 jobs for upstate New York as Senator. But what happened? The Washington Post writes, and I quote: “upstate job growth stagnated overall during her tenure, with manufacturing jobs plunging nearly 25 percent…the former first lady was unable to pass big ticket legislation… Many promised jobs never materialized and others migrated to other states as she turned to her first presidential run…data shows that upstate actually lost jobs during Clinton’s first term.”Compare that to my record. In a recent New York Post article by Steve Cuozzo, “How Donald Trump Helped Save New York City,” the paper writes that I — and this is a direct quote — “waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out…almost by force of will — [he] rode to the rescue. Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kickstarting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead.”This is what I want to do for our country – I want to jumpstart America.Now let’s look at what the Obama-Clinton policies have done nationally.Their policies produced 1.2% growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression, and a doubling of the national debt.There are now 94.3 million Americans outside the labor force. It was 80.5 million when President Obama took office, an increase of nearly 14 million people. The Obama-Clinton agenda of tax, spend and regulate has created a silent nation of jobless Americans.Home ownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.Nearly 12 million have been added to the food stamp rolls since President Obama took office. Another nearly 7 million Americans were added to the ranks of those in poverty.We have the lowest labor force participation rates in four decades.58 percent of African-American youth are either outside the labor force or not employed.1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force. These are the real unemployment numbers – the five percent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics. Meanwhile, American households are earning more than $4,000 less today than they were sixteen years ago.The average worker today pays 31.5 percent of their wages to income and payroll taxes. On top of that, state and local taxes consume another 10 percent.The United States also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrialized nations of the world, at 35 percent. It’s almost 40 percent when you add in taxes at the state level.In other words, we punish companies for making products in America – but let them ship products into the U.S. tax-free if they move overseas.This is backwards. All of our policies should be geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside the United States.Read more: ‘President Donald Trump’ In Top Ten Risk Events for Global EconomyUnder my plan, no American company will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. Small businesses will benefit the most from this plan. Hillary Clinton’s plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what I am proposing, and her onerous regulations will put them totally out of business. 32 I am going to cut regulations massively.Our lower business tax will also end job-killing corporate inversions, and cause trillions in new dollars and wealth to come pouring into our country – and into cities like Detroit. To help unleash this new job creation, we will allow businesses to immediately expense new business investments.No one will gain more from these proposals than low-and-middle income Americans.My plan will also help reduce the cost of childcare by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of childcare spending from their taxes.We are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from American businesses that is now parked overseas. 33 Our plan will bring that cash home, applying a 10 percent tax. This money will be re-invested in states like Michigan.Finally, no family will have to pay the death tax. American workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not be taxed again at death – it’s just plain wrong. We will repeal it.Next comes regulatory reformAs with taxes, I will have one overriding goal when it comes to regulation: I want to keep jobs and wealth in America.Motor vehicle manufacturing is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country. The U.S. economy today is twenty-five percent smaller than it would have been without the surge of regulations since 1980.It is estimated that current overregulation is costing our economy as much as $2 trillion dollars a year – that’s money taken straight out of cities like yours.The federal register is now over 80,000 pages long. As the Wall Street Journal noted, President Obama has issued close to four hundred new major regulations since taking office, each with a cost to the American economy of $100 million or more. In 2015 alone, the Obama Administration unilaterally issued more than 2,000 new regulations – each a hidden tax on American consumers, and a massive lead weight on the American economy.It is time to remove the anchor dragging us down.Upon taking office, I will issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations. My running mate, Mike Pence, signed a similar order when he became governor of Indiana. This will give our American companies the certainty they need to reinvest in our community, get cash off of the sidelines, start hiring for new jobs, and expanding businesses.I will also immediately cancel all illegal and overreaching executive orders.Next, I will ask each and every federal agency to prepare a list of all of the regulations they impose on Americans which are not necessary, do not improve public safety, and which needlessly kill jobs. Those regulations will be eliminated.We are in a competition with the world, and I want America to win. When I am president, we will.One of the most important reforms of all is trade reformAs Bernie Sanders has said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgment. 40 We’ve seen this bad judgment overseas, in Libya, Iraq, and Syria. We’ve seen it in Iran. We’ve seen it from President Obama, when he gives $150 billion to Iran, the number one terror state, and even gives them $400 million in money-laundered cash as a ransom payment.But we’ve also seen the terrible Obama-Clinton judgment right here in DetroitHillary Clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city, and this country, of its jobs and wealth.She supported Bill Clinton’s NAFTA, she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization, she supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and she supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Let’s talk about South Korea for a moment, because it so perfectly illustrates the broken promises that have hurt so many American workers.President Obama, and the usual so-called experts who’ve been wrong about every trade deal for decades, predicted that the trade deal with South Korea would increase our exports to South Korea by more than $10 billion – resulting in some 70,000 jobs.Like Hillary Clinton’s broken promises to New York, these pledges all turned out to be false. Instead of creating 70,000 jobs, it has killed nearly 100,000, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Our exports to South Korea haven’t increased at all, but their imports to us have surged more than $15 billion – more than doubling our trade deficit with that country.The next betrayal will be the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Hillary Clinton’s closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed what I have said on this from the beginning: if sent to the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton will enact the TPP. Guaranteed. Her donors will make sure of it.A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for TPP – and it’s also a vote for NAFTA.Our annual trade deficit in goods with Mexico has risen from close to zero in 1993 to almost $60 billion. 54 Our total trade deficit in goods hit nearly $800 billion last year.This is a strike at the heart of Michigan, and our nation as a whole.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000.Detroit is still waiting for Hillary Clinton’s apology. I expect Detroit will get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton turns over the 33,000 emails she deleted.Hillary Clinton’s Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will be an even bigger disaster for the auto industry. In fact, Ford Motor Company has announced its opposition to the deal.According to the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S. trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost over 1 million manufacturing jobs in 2015.By far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parts, which lost nearly 740,000 manufacturing jobs.Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members.Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved. That is why I have announced we will withdraw from the deal before that can ever happen. Hillary Clinton will never withdraw from the TPP. She is bought, controlled and paid-for by her donors and special interests.Because my only interest is the American people, I have previously laid out a detailed 7-point plan for trade reform, available on my website. It includes strong protections against currency manipulation, tariffs against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods, and it includes a renegotiation of NAFTA. If we don’t get a better deal, we will walk away.At the center of my plan is trade enforcement with China. This alone could return millions of jobs into our economy.China is responsible for nearly half of our entire trade deficit. They break the rules in every way imaginable. China engages in illegal export subsidies, prohibited currency manipulation, and rampant theft of intellectual property. They also have no real environmental or labor protections, further undercutting American workers.Just enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions of American jobs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America’s intellectual property in China would produce more than 2 million more jobs right here in the United States.Add to that the saved jobs from cracking down on currency cheating and product dumping, and we will bring trillions of dollars in new wealth and wages back to the United States.Trade has big benefits, and I am in favor of trade. But I want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for American workers. Isolation is not an option, only great and wellcrafted trade deals are.Also critical to our economic renewal will be energy reformThe Obama-Clinton Administration has blocked and destroyed millions of jobs through their anti-energy regulations, while raising the price of electricity for both families and businesses.As a result of recent Obama EPA actions coal-fired power plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions. The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs. Hillary Clinton says her plan will “put a lot of coal companies and coal miners out of business.”We will put our coal miners and steel workers back to work. Clinton not only embraces President Obama’s job-killing energy restrictions but wants to expand them, including going after oil and natural gas production that employs some 10 million Americans.According to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, the Obama-Clinton energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.A Trump Administration will end this war on the American worker, and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country.According to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on all sources of American energy will:Increase GDP by more than $100 billion dollars annually, add over 500,000 new jobs annually, and increase annual wages by more than $30 billion dollars over the next 7 years;Increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion dollars over 4 decades;Increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion dollars over the next 40 years.The reforms I have outlined today are only the beginningWhen we reform our tax, trade, energy and regulatory policies, we will open a new chapter in American Prosperity.We can use this new wealth to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.As part of this new future, we will also be rolling out proposals to increase choice and reduce cost in childcare, offering much-needed relief to American families. I will unveil my plan on this in the coming weeks that I have been working on with my daughter Ivanka and an incredible team of experts.Likewise, our education reforms will help parents send their kids to a school of their choice.We will also give our police and law enforcement the funds and support they need to restore law and order to this country. Without security, there can be no prosperity. We must have law and order.In the coming days, we will be rolling out plans on all of these items. One of my first acts as President will be to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, saving another 2 million American jobs.We will also rebuild our military, and get our allies to pay their fair share for the protection we provide – saving us countless more billions to invest in our own country.Read more: Here’s a Factcheck of Hillary Clinton’s Attack on Donald Trump’s Economic PoliciesWe also have a plan, on our website, for a complete reform of the Veterans Health Administration. This is something so desperately needed to make sure our vets are fully supported and get the care they deserve.Detroit – the Motor City – will come roaring back. We will offer a new future, not the same old failed policies of the past.Our party has chosen to make new history by selecting a nominee from outside the rigged and corrupt system.The other party has reached backwards into the past to choose a nominee from yesterday – who offers only the rhetoric of yesterday, and the policies of yesterday.There will be no change under Hillary Clinton – only four more years of Obama.But we are going to look boldly into the future.We will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, sea ports and airports that our country deserves. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will connect our cities, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring.We will put new American metal into the spine of this nation. It will be American hands that rebuild this country, and it will be American energy – mined from American sources — that powers this country.It will be American workers who are hired to do the job. Americanism, not globalism, will be our new credo.Our country will reach amazing new heights. All we have to do is stop relying on the tired voices of the past. We can’t fix a rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place.We can’t solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created them. Only by changing to new leadership, and new solutions, will we get new results.We need to stop believing in politicians, and start believing in America. Before everything great that has ever happened, the doubters have always said it couldn’t be done. America is ready to prove the doubters wrong. They want you to think small. I am asking you to think big.We are ready to dream great things for our country once again.SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT	1

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.CROWLEY: Normally, on Sundays, we take a reflective look at the past week and set the agenda for the coming days, but today is no normal Sunday. We are four hours away from a showdown in the House of Representatives, a series of votes that will determine the future of health care reform, impact the economy, influence this November's election and set the stage for the rest of President Obama's agenda. Today is no normal Sunday. Today is game day. I am Candy Crowley and this is State of the Union.This morning, health reform from all angles. Two House leaders, John Larson and Mike Pence, on today's vote. Two senior senators, Dianne Feinstein, and Orrin Hatch, on the week ahead. And analysis from Donna Brazile and Bill Bennett.We have heard the words ""end game"" so many times in this health care debate, I wouldn't try it now. That said, it would in fact be the end if Republicans prevailed in today's vote. For Democrats, the magic number is 216. That's how many yeas needed to pass the health care bill in the House, 216 votes among the 253 Democratic members. It has been a struggle all week to get there. We begin with seven days in two minutes.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)DAVID AXELROD, SR. ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT: I think we will have the votes.REP. JOHN A. BOEHNER, R-OHIO: If she had 216 votes, this bill would be long gone.PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Hello, Ohio!REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: When we bring the bill to the floor, we will have the votes.REP. JAMES E. CLYBURN, D-S.C., MAJORITY WHIP: We need to get to 216. And we are still tweaking stuff.OBAMA: Your own congressman, who is tireless on behalf of the working people, Dennis Kucinich.ROBERT GIBBS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It is an important trip that the president will take. And I think he looks forward to it. REP. ERIC CANTOR, R-VA.: I mean, it is clear. They don't have the votes, because the American people can't stand this bill.REP. DENNIS J. KUCINICH, D-OHIO: I've decided to cast a vote in favor of the legislation.GIBBS: That he must postpone his planned visits for a later date.REP. BART STUPAK, D-MICH.: As of today, I am still voting no. Yes, I am still standing with this principle, protecting the sanctity of life. Yes.OBAMA: Hello, George Mason!(UNKNOWN): Yes. I will be voting yes for the bill.PELOSI: Right now, we are just getting votes to pass a bill.OBAMA: And in just a few days, a century-long struggle will culminate in a historic vote.BOEHNER: We are about 24 hours from Armageddon.CROWD: Kill the bill, kill the bill, kill the bill!REP. ANH ""JOSEPH"" CAO, R-LA.: Tomorrow will be a sad day for me as I cast a no vote against something I believe we need.(UNKNOWN): I will be a proud supporter of health care reform.REP. STENY H. HOYER, D-MD., MAJORITY LEADER: Clearly, we believe we have the vote.(UNKNOWN): We feel like we have been pregnant for 17 months. Let's get on with it already.OBAMA: We have been debating health care for decades. It has now been debated for a year. It is in your hands.(END VIDEOTAPE)CROWLEY: Here to look ahead to today's vote and the high stakes politics surrounding it, House Democratic Caucus Chairman, John Larson of Connecticut, and the House Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence of Indiana. Gentlemen, thank you both for joining me.PENCE: Thank you, Candy.LARSON: Great to be with you, Candy.CROWLEY: State of play, where are you? 216, do you have it locked in?LARSON: This is a historic day. And we are happy warriors. We are so proud of the Democratic caucus, that we will be a part of history, joining Franklin Delano Roosevelt's passage of Social Security, Lyndon Johnson's passage of Medicare, and now Barack Obama's passage of health care reform.CROWLEY: So you have got the 216?LARSON: We've got the votes. And the reason for that, Candy, I think it started earlier this week with Natoma Canfield becoming the poster child for -- or lady for health care reform. And that struck such a cord within our caucus. And Dennis Moore standing up to give a speech in the caucus was Blackberried by a woman who works with him in Kansas. She said thank you for voting for this. I know I am losing my job at the end of this year, and unfortunately, I have just been diagnosed with cancer. Without this bill, I'm lost. Dennis ended by saying, and she is 24. You could have heard a pin drop.This is about whose side you are on. And clearly, this historic moment in the people's chamber, we are on the side of the American people and those that have been denied access to health care, and those who have pre-existing conditions who have been denied, and those who have had their policies rescinded.CROWLEY: Congressman Pence, I think that puts you on the side not of the people, if we take his calculation. What is left for Republicans to do? Congressman Larson says they have the 216. So it is all over but the shouting? You guys vote no and move on?PENCE: Well, I don't know if they have the votes. House Republicans are going to use every means at our disposal.CROWLEY: What is that?PENCE: Well, stay tuned, Candy. It's going to be an interesting day.CROWLEY: Can you disrupt the vote? I mean, what's available?PENCE: We are going to use every means at our disposal to oppose this government takeover of health care. Because quite frankly, as thousands gather at rallies all across this country and here in the nation's capital, yesterday, you know, the American people are sick and tired of runaway federal spending by both parties, of borrowing and bailouts and takeovers. And I believe this is going to be a historic weekend.LARSON: It is.PENCE: But I think it is going to be different from the way John thinks it is going to be. I think this is going to be a historic weekend because I think this weekend is going to be the beginning of the end of business as usual in Washington, D.C. I think the American people see an administration and see a Congress that are in a headlong rush to confront the very real challenges that we have in health care with more government instead of more freedom.They know -- the Republicans have been offering solutions from the beginning. Let people purchase health insurance across state lines, pass malpractice reform, cover preexisting conditions. All of that can be done without a massive, trillion-dollar expansion of the federal government and burdening future generations with more deficits and more debt.CROWLEY: But the reality of this day is that you don't have the votes to stop it. You may have the means to delay it. PENCE: Right. You know, the Republicans, it shouldn't be a news flash to anybody, Republicans don't have the votes to stop anything in the House of Representatives. We are in a decisive minority.CROWLEY: (inaudible) politically.PENCE: But what's remarkable about this one-year debate has proven my point, that a minority in Congress plus the American people equals a majority. Republicans -- the reason they weren't able to do this last year -- remember all the deadlines? We had deadlines in the summer, we had deadlines in the fall, we had deadlines at the end of the year. The American people don't want this government takeover of health care. And I don't know if they have the votes today, but I guarantee you, the American people know they have the votes in America.LARSON: The American people who are already on Medicare, all of our veterans who already receive Tricare, understand the importance and the value of having insurance coverage. For 47 million Americans who have none, 31 million will now be able to have access to insurance, lowering costs, lowering costs for small businesses, lowering the national debt. First, $138 billion, and then $1.2 trillion. We can't afford not to do this. And taking care of those people--(CROSSTALK)CROWLEY: I want to talk about the debt. Hang on one second. I have got to take a small break--(CROSSTALK)CROWLEY: We will come back. I do want to talk about the costs. There are some figures out there floating. I'll do that, we'll be back with Congressmen Larson and Pence right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CROWLEY: We are back with Democratic Congressman John Larson of Connecticut and Republican Congressman Mike Pence of Indiana. We were talking about the cost of this. The CBO has said over 10 years this health care bill will reduce the deficit by $143 billion.However, that doesn't include what might come and what has been promised, with more than a wink and a nod to doctors, which is to up their Medicare payments, their reimbursements, which would cost $208 million, which then means it actually would be -- would add to the deficit.Is that -- is my math correct there? LARSON: Well, if that were to be true. But here is the thing, there is no question about the fact that we need to take care of the docs and we need to emphasize primary care. But also what never gets discussed, Candy, is something that Reuters came out with earlier this year, $700 billion annually in inefficiencies in this system, lack of interoperability in hospitals, lack of a continuum of care, and fraud and abuse -- $700 billion.I think that we're going to -- that's $7 trillion over a 10-year period. I think that we're more than going to be able to wring out the cost in there. I think that's why the president brought people down to Washington, to the White House, that's why he brought the six (ph) in to try to wring out those costs as we go forward.You know, we spend 20 percent of gross domestic product. The closest country to us is Switzerland. I can't believe that we can't get that money out of there.CROWLEY: Can't we get that money out of there?PENCE: Yes, yes, we do such a great job here in Washington wringing out the cost.LARSON: Now that's in the private sector.PENCE: One-point-six trillion dollar deficit this year, you know, only in Washington D.C. could you say with a straight face that you are going to spend $1 trillion and save tax-payers money. Look, you point out the doc fix. This is a total fraud. The Democrats are leaving out $200 billion in spending that the speaker of the house committed again this week to spend, which makes this -- even using this CBO's numbers, it makes it a bill that adds to the deficit in the short term and in the long term.But look, even beyond that, Candy, the American people know that you expand the federal government's role in health care without giving the American people more health care choices by purchasing across state lines, without passing any medical malpractice reform at all -- roughly a third of health care costs in this country I hear are actually defensive medicine driven by junk lawsuits.The American people know this is going to cost more and add more to the deficit, add more to the debt, cost higher taxes even than the rosiest scenarios that are presented...LARSON: The CBO is the bible. The CBO says...CROWLEY: It is, but it's not always accurate, as you know.LARSON: We have arguments with them all of the time, but...CROWLEY: Somebody once told me that predicting...LARSON: ... that's all that we can -- that's all that we can vote on.CROWLEY: Sure, absolutely. But it still is one of those things that we might not find out...PENCE: And the president...CROWLEY: ... except for 10 years from now.LARSON: And the president has put in numerous reforms that are going to take effect, including the inability to rescind your insurance policy, pre-existing conditions. For women across this country, Candy, I mean, there birth is a pre-existing condition, domestic violence is a pre-existing condition, a C-section is a pre- existing condition, in-vitro fertilization, come on.(CROSSTALK)PENCE: My wife had to -- John, my wife had a pre-existing condition. I lost my job about 15 years ago. My wife had a pre- existing condition. She was pregnant with our daughter Audrey. We went to the state guarantee fund, a fund that would be replenished if we passed medical malpractice reform, we could use the savings to strengthen those funds to cover people like my wife was covered.You don't need a government takeover of health care. You don't need to mandate that every American purchase health insurance whether they want it or need it or not, and you don't need to put us on a pathway towards socialized medicine.LARSON: Where is the takeover by the government?PENCE: And that's what this crowd is doing today.LARSON: Where is the takeover by the government? CROWLEY: Let me ask you something, just turn...LARSON: Humana runs Medicare currently. Tricare is run by them. Where is the takeover of government?PENCE: Well, I'll break it down. John, if you mandate that every American purchase health insurance, you mandate that every business provide it...LARSON: Do we mandate that people get car insurance?PENCE: ... you create a...(CROSSTALK)PENCE: ... so that people end up in government-run insurance, and you provide public funding for abortion, you mandate insurance plans, cover it within the exchange...LARSON: There is no funding for abortion in this bill.PENCE: It is a government takeover of health care.LARSON: There is no funding for abortion in this bill. It follows Hyde. That's not -- that's the case. PENCE: John, you know that is not true. The Catholic Church...LARSON: I know it's absolutely true.PENCE: ... the Catholic bishops, the right to life says...LARSON: Sixty thousand nuns can't be wrong.PENCE: ... public funding for abortions is in this bill.LARSON: Thank God for the sisters of Notre Dame, that's what I think.CROWLEY: Let me call a time here, because we are out of time. But for more of this, our audience can tune into the House debate starting this afternoon. And I suspect that pass or not pass, this debate continues as we watch how it goes.LARSON: That's right. Very strong disagreements. But Mike Pence is an honorable man. And I look forward to this debate, and as are our colleagues. I hope that we do ratchet down the conversation though, because when two of our colleagues are spat on and hurled racial slurs, it is time...CROWLEY: It did indeed happen.LARSON: ... it's time to ratchet down things a little bit.PENCE: Well, I'll tell you, I was in Selma with John Lewis, if what is reported to have happened was reported is contemptible, I denounce it in the strongest terms. But I assure you, this debate will not end today.LARSON: I agree with that.CROWLEY: Or probably on this show.LARSON: I agree with that.CROWLEY: Thank you very much, I appreciate it.LARSON: There is going to be a lot of work to go to...CROWLEY: If health care reform wins passage in the House today, the measure heads back to the Senate. Up next, a quick tutorial on what happens next. And then a conversation with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein and Republican Senator Orrin Hatch.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CROWLEY: A quick reality check for those who today's House votes will bring us to the finish line, not quite, not yet. If House Democrats muster the votes today, two things happen. First the Senate version of health care reform will be passed by the House and will then be ready for the president to sign into law. Second, House Democrats will pass a fix-it bill, a companion measure of sorts to correct the things they don't like about the Senate measure. That bill has to go to the Senate. If the Senate goes the easy route, they will pass the fixes without change and send it off to the president. But if the Senate changes anything, if it adds or subtracts from the House measure, it must go back to the House for another vote before it goes to the president.Senate Republicans have some options which could delay or change the bill, including parliamentary challenges to any part of it as unrelated to the budget. Why didn't the ""Schoolhouse Rock"" teach us about this? We will do our best to get answers on what comes next from senators Orrin Hatch and Dianne Feinstein right after the break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CROWLEY: As we explained, even if the health care reform bill wins passage in the House later today, it still has another legislative hurdle to clear, back to the Senate for those changes or fixes, if you will, that House Democrats want.Joining us, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah.So the other day I noticed, Senator Hatch, that you said it would be nuts for anyone to believe that this is the House's last word on this. You think the Senate will change the fix-it bill that's coming over to you?HATCH: Well, if the rules are followed, they'd have to. Because there is a Social Security component. And you can't do that on reconciliation. There's also an appropriations component as well.So if -- if the parliamentarian upholds that and Joe Biden doesn't overrule the parliamentarian, which would be a first, then it seems to me that it's going to have to be sent back to the House. So anybody that thinks that this is only going to be a one-time deal today in the House, I think, is grossly mistaken.CROWLEY: Senator Feinstein, do you think it's possible for the Senate to take that bill and just go, OK, fine with us?FEINSTEIN: Yes, I do. And I think that's exactly what we'll do. And I really disagree with my friend and colleague. I believe there are at least 51 votes there. I think the bill has been carefully vetted with the parliamentarian. I believe he will stand for each part of it.And the bill that the House passes today goes to the president. He signs it. Then the reconciliation bill comes over to us. We'll probably begin debate on Tuesday. It will be posted -- it takes some time -- begin debate on Tuesday.Now, I'm sure what Senator Hatch's party will do is submit a whole host of amendments. We'll have a major vote-a-thon. And this will go on for several days. And I believe, at the end, more than 51 Democrats will hold firm and will pass the reconciliation bill and we will have health care reform. I can say, for my state, the reconciliation bill is very important. Because we have now 8 million people without any insurance in California. The number has gone up 1 million people a year for the last two years. So this bill is necessary.CROWLEY: Senator Hatch, I want to ask you about the vote-a-thon, but I first want to play something Senator Reid said recently.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. HARRY REID, D-NEV., SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: We're in the last minute of play. The shot clock is turned off. The other side knows what the outcome will be. So they're trying to foul us and foul us and foul us and foul us again, just to keep the clock from reading zero. They're not just delaying the inevitable; they're delaying the imperative.(END VIDEO CLIP)CROWLEY: Are you going on after -- after the shot clock has...(LAUGHTER)I mean, you know, Senator Feinstein calls it a vote-a-thon. I mean, is this the Republican approach to this now, is just to delay the inevitable?HATCH: Well, not really. I think it's to try and get amendments passed that really are valid amendments. I think, if you have a Social Security component in it, it has -- it has to come back to the House. And a parliamentarian has to rule the right way.But who knows? I don't know what the parliamentarian is going to do. All I can say is this. You know, as I walk around this country, and I've been all over the country, people come up to me from everywhere, Democrats, Republicans, saying, we can't afford this; we can't do this. We do not even have solid, final scoring on this.As a matter of fact, the actuary at CMS said he cannot get the final scoring. They also don't include the doc fix in it, which is $371 billion, and that's at present worth. And that doesn't even take care of Medicaid.Of the 31 million people you're going to cover, 16 million are pushed into Medicaid.I mean, let me just tell you, we're coming to a Europeanization of America. And the American people sense it. They feel it. They know that we can't afford this.And, frankly, the doc fix that they have on Medicaid...(CROSSTALK) HATCH: He's a letter -- here's a letter from my governor saying -- now, for two years, they say they'll hold the states free. But then you go off the clip because they cannot afford to pay for it in the federal government.And -- and Medicaid, they're paying -- the doctors are getting 66 percent of what the private sector pays doctors. And they're up in arms. They're not going to take patients now. You can imagine how bad this is going to be if this bill goes through.CROWLEY: Senator Feinstein, do you worry about either unintended consequences or changes in the economy that could, in the end, if this is made into law, really ruin some aspects of health care?FEINSTEIN: Well, of course. This isn't the perfect bill. We all know that.HATCH: Well, that's for sure.FEINSTEIN: We all know that there are going to have to be fixes down the road, just as every major program has had; Medicare has had; Social Security will likely have because of the explosion of costs.Having said that, you have to look at the basics. And the basics are that we pay far more than European nations do for health care. And they have a much better performance.We're about 15 percent; France is 10 percent. And in overall performance by the World Health Organization, France is ranked number one. I think we're ranked 17.We spend a lot of money, but we don't necessarily spend it in the right way or the right places.Now, let me just finish. This bill is really important. Because, if we don't pass it now, you can forget health care reform forever after, I believe. So this is the opportunity. We're right at the goal line. I believe it's going to pass the House. It will be signed by the president. We should pass a reconciliation bill.And I would really appeal to my good friend, Senator Hatch. Let this reconciliation bill get passed. Then, you can see. If it's wrong, you'll certainly say so. If it works, hopefully, you'll say so as well.CROWLEY: And we'll get your answer right after this, because I've got to take a break. And we'll find out if you listened to her appeal, right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CROWLEY: We are back with two top senators, Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Republican Orrin Hatch.When last we met, she was asking if you would just let this reconciliation bill go through and see what happens. FEINSTEIN: Suggesting.(LAUGHTER)HATCH: Well, let me tell you, Republicans are dedicated against this bill. We consider it an awful bill.Do you realize they're going to subsidize families that make over -- families of four that make over $80,000 a year?I mean, we're getting to where 50 percent of the people in this country are going to depend on subsidies. And, of course, I know Dianne can't agree with that or doesn't believe in that.But -- and all I can say is -- is, everywhere I go, people say, how do we pay for this? You know, in all honesty, they have jacked up the costs of Medicare. They're going to take better than $500 billion, now, out of Medicare. They're going to increase taxes by over $500 billion. They're going to sock it to individuals who don't -- who can't afford to buy insurance. They're going to have to pay 2.5 percent of their gross income.Businesses are now going to have to pay up to $3,000 per employee if they don't provide health insurance.You reach a point where you say, who is going to pay for all of this? And it's going to come down to us taxpayers. And like I say, it's the Europeanization of America, and that's the worst thing that could possibly happen to our country.CROWLEY: You -- you said earlier that, of course, there were things that worried you about the bill. If you looked at in the totality, what worries you the most?Is there anything that he says that you think, you know, yes, that is a worry of mine?FEINSTEIN: Well, there -- the bill is a combination of a number of different things designed to cover more people. The bill has very big strong points. For example, right away, there's a $5 billion fund for people with pre-existing conditions who can't get health insurance today.HATCH: We're both for that. We're both for that.FEINSTEIN: That's a very positive thing.HATCH: Sure.FEINSTEIN: So the bill, when really accumulated, the Congressional Budget Office says, will save, over 10 years, $138 billion.Now, Orrin will say, well, it's not this; it's not that; it's not the other thing. But that's the fact that we go on when we assess a bill. CROWLEY: But isn't also true, Senator...FEINSTEIN: So over 10 years, this bill, I'm confident, will not cost more.Now, as I said, are there certain parts that may have to be tweaked, that don't work exactly right? But he has given a litany of complaints about the bill. The thrust of the bill is to provide more people with coverage.One of the good things the bill does is it reduces the nonpremium costs for those 85 percent of people that have medical health insurance. It reduces it from 20 percent to 15 percent so that more money from insurance companies will actually go for medical care. And I think that's important.CROWLEY: Politically, isn't it going to be hard to argue, should this bill pass, and we think it will, just given the numbers, to say, listen, people are now going to be -- not be thrown off their insurance because they got sick. There will be no more caps.FEINSTEIN: Exactly.CROWLEY: There will be help for people down the road, to help subsidize it. How can you argue against that? Isn't that a pretty political powerful package?HATCH: Well, I'm not arguing -- I'm not arguing against that. I think Republicans certainly -- we could agree on a large percentage of things together. But there was really no effort to get us involved.All I can say is this, is that everywhere I go -- and I've said it over and over -- people say, how are you going to pay for this? How do you pay for it?Now, the CMS actuary -- that's the actuary for the administration -- says the cost curve will not be bent, that premiums are going to go up. I have to say that I believe that -- that CBO -- of course they have to decide these budgetary matters based upon the papers given them by the House of Representatives and by the Senate, and those papers are stacked in favor of trying to live within our means, but they don't.The fact is that they double-count in this bill. They have all kinds of other gimmicks in this bill that try to get this bill down to -- everybody knows that this, extrapolated over 10 years, is going to be $2.5 trillion more on top of what we're already spending, $2.4 trillion.You cannot tell me that this country can afford to do that and that we can't find a way, by working together, to really come up with a health care system that will work and work within financial means.CROWLEY: I'm going to give you the last short word. And that is, are you comfortable with the cost of this bill...FEINSTEIN: Yes.CROWLEY: ... and comfortable the country can afford it?FEINSTEIN: Yes. I believe we can. And I believe that will be sorted out over time.I think there's one thing that isn't in the bill, that the president was good enough to take my bill, which would give the secretary of health and human services some control over the rate of premiums to ensure that they are reasonable for people who have private-sector insurance. Unfortunately, the parliamentarian said that could not be added to the reconciliation bill. I have introduced it as a separate bill.I believe this is a huge problem out there. You have Anthem in California and 800,000 policies just jacking up premiums up to 39 percent in California and then saying there may be another increase in the middle of the year.And so people are being pushed off of their health insurance because of the cost of premiums. And this is one thing we need to strengthen, in my view, and hopefully will as a separate piece of legislation.CROWLEY: Senator Dianne Feinstein, Senator Orrin Hatch, I can't thank you both enough for coming. I appreciate it.FEINSTEIN: Thank you.CROWLEY: More of this on the Senate floor next week...FEINSTEIN: Oh, you bet.CROWLEY: ... we promise. (LAUGHTER)FEINSTEIN: Thank you.CROWLEY: Up next, in our ""American Dispatch,"" why, despite the claims of some politicians, it's hard to say exactly how most Americans feel about the health reform bill. And then Donna Brazile and Ben Bennett on the potential fallout for both Democratic and Republican lawmakers up for re-election this fall.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CROWLEY: Our ""American Dispatch"" looks at a central question. What do Americans think?House Republican Leader John Boehner answers for Republicans.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BOEHNER: Because the American people are saying ""Stop,"" and they're screaming at the top of their lungs. (END VIDEO CLIP)CROWLEY: But are they? Two polls released this week leave lots of room for debate. A Pew poll released Thursday asks, ""Do you favor or oppose the current bill?""Only 38 percent said they favor it. So is Minority Leader Boehner right?A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll asks, ""Is it better to pass the Obama plan or keep the current system?""The respondents were split right down the middle.Is it in the way the question is asked? Are more people more likely to support it when it's called the Obama plan or is it that people think some change is better than no change?You be the judge. We will sort through the complicated politics of all this with Donna Brazile and Bill Bennett after a short break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CROWLEY: Joining me here in Washington, two of my favorite people, CNN political contributor and Democratic strategist Donna Brazile and CNN political contributor and host of ""Morning in America,"" Bill Bennett, who is also author of the new book ""A Century Turns."" These authors and stuff, OK.The politics of all this. John Larson, head of the Democratic caucus, says they've got the 216, done deal, goes over to the Senate, Dianne Feinstein all confident they're going to pass it. It's going to be law. How does this all play out politically? I want to play you something the -- two things, actually, the president said yesterday. First, there was this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: I am actually confident -- I've talked to some of you individually -- that it will end up being the smart thing to do politically, because I believe that good policy is good politics.(END VIDEO CLIP)CROWLEY: OK, now, about two minutes later, he had this to say.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: Now, I can't guarantee that this is good politics. Every one of you know your districts better than I do.(END VIDEO CLIP)CROWLEY: So, let's see, I'm thinking we're not really sure how the politics are going to play out. What do you think? BENNETT: Yes, well, as a former teacher of logic, he didn't contradict himself, because he said I believe this will be good politics because it's good policy, but I can't guarantee it. OK, we've heard that before.I think it's bad politics, because I think it's bad policy, and not just from a partisan point of view, but let me just do it analytically. You would not have so many nervous Democrats if this looked like it was really good politics. I don't think it is.And, again, I think, when we see how this plays out, one play will be in November with the midterm elections. Another play, we'll see what happens with budget issues.And since misrepresentations are all over the place in this -- in this proposal, and you look at a state like Massachusetts, which is a state closest to what this federal program is, I think they're going to regret it. Be careful what you wish for, Richard Butler (ph) said, because you may get it.CROWLEY: You know, Donna, what the White House is counting on -- what Democrats are counting on is that, after this is signed into law, people will go, ""Oh, you mean I won't be thrown my"" -- that there will be things in there, and their argument has always been, ""Well, they don't really know what it's in this bill."" Is that going to work?BRAZILE: Well, it's true, Candy, that only 15 percent of voters understand what's inside the bill because we've been talking about the pie crust and not what's in the filling. And I think as soon as they understand that children with pre-existing conditions will not be kicked off their policies, small businesses will have access to an exchange that will help lower their costs and provide better coverage for their employees, I think as soon as they learn the details of this proposal, they will become very comfortable with it.And we all know that the -- that the price that the American people will pay if Congress fails to act is that their premiums will continue to rise $10,000 over the next 15 years. This is good policy, is good politics, it's good for the American people, it's good for the economy. There's no reason for Democrats to run away from this bill.CROWLEY: So you don't think that the Democrats are going to lose seats this November because of the health care bill?BRAZILE: Democrats will lose seats, Republicans will lose seats simply because there are open seats that will no longer go into the Democratic column. They will lose seats...CROWLEY: But not because of health care?BRAZILE: Well, health care, Candy -- and some Democrats might lose because the voters are simply tired of that Democrat and may be tired of Republicans, too. I don't think we should judge this bill based on who will win and who will lose if we're doing what's right for the American people, we're doing what's right for taxpayers. This is a good approach to trying to solve a very longstanding problem in this country.CROWLEY: And that's how the president sold it, right? It was like, don't...BENNETT: Sure.CROWLEY: ... Don't do this on politics. Do this because it's the right thing to do.BENNETT: Look, that's fine. Pericles says courage is the secret of democracy. The president has said something like that, too, do the courageous thing. I think some members of Congress, some Democrats have heard that as, ""Do what my conscience tells me,"" people like Bart Stupak, so we shall -- we shall see.But hold the tape, this tape. Not to be mean, but Democrats will lose seats on this. They will lose a lot of seats. Again, this is what the nervousness is about.Now, if this turns out to surprise me and surprise a lot of people and be profoundly good policy, save the tape for that, too, because I will say to so. But look what happened in Massachusetts. You only had 4 percent uninsured. This thing opened the floodgates. What happens when you nationalize this kind of issue? You have states like Texas and California with 25 percent and 30 percent uninsured. This could bust the budget and really hurt the country.BRAZILE: Well, you know, what's disingenuous about the arguments that the opponents of health care reform will constantly give is that they're worried about the deficit, they're worried about the deficit. Well, if we do nothing, health care will...(CROSSTALK)BRAZILE: ... consume about 20 percent to 25 percent of our GDP. If we do nothing, individuals like myself and others who have individual policies will see their premiums continue to rise.If the Republicans would like to somehow or another defend 39 percent increase in health care costs, children getting kicked off their policies simply because they have asthma, let them go out and defend that. Democrats will defend the substance of this and let the politics play out, you know, in November.BENNETT: Obamacare and doing nothing are not the only options. There are lots of other plans and lots of other ideas fully fleshed out, as Paul Ryan's plan that he wrote with Tom Coburn. This is a plan that never got to see the light of day, never allowed a scoring by CBO. We may revisit it again in the future when we see what this one wreaks.CROWLEY: Is this -- is health care the election issue, or is it really the economy?BRAZILE: It's the economy. It's the economy. It's jobs. It's people feeling secure about their own livelihood. It's the American dream that's at stake. And, look, Paul Ryan had a plan that covered 3 million Americans, reduced the deficit by $30 billion. This is a plan that will cover 32 million additional Americans and reduce the deficit over $138 billion in the next 10 years and, of course, $1.2 trillion over the next 20 years.If this -- this is good policy. Republicans who are concerned about the deficit, like Democrats and independents, should get behind this bill.CROWLEY: Bottom line, Ryan won't pass. Is it...BENNETT: Right.CROWLEY: So it will be this. But is this the election-year issue or is it jobs?BENNETT: It's a big part of it, and jobs is a big part of it, but there's a larger thing, too, which is Washington and distrust of government. And who do they think they are? And don't they know, can't they read that a majority of us said we were opposed to this, we really don't like this?And when the costs start coming in -- and, by the way, when they count the doctor fix, which is going to put this in deficit, they will see it's more cost to the government, more cost to the taxpayer, higher taxes. It's going to cost the Democrats. It's bad policy, bad politics.BRAZILE: Let me -- let me quote -- let me -- let me quote Janet Jackson.CROWLEY: Make it a short quote.BRAZILE: What have you done for me lately? You've done nothing on jobs. You've done nothing on health care. You've done nothing to help fix this economy. The American people like to vote for something, not just against something.BENNETT: Well, they'll have the chance. They'll have the chance. And you will have your way, and the Democrats will rule on this, and probably get it, and then they will own the store.BRAZILE: Well, we're going to still love you, though.BENNETT: Well, I hope so.CROWLEY: The love-fest will continue. And they will be back, I promise you.BENNETT: We'll still be your favorites? We'll still be your favorites?CROWLEY: Still my favorites, I promise.BRAZILE: Thank you.CROWLEY: Ahead, my colleague and former ""State of the Union"" host John King is back here for a Sunday chat about his new show.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CROWLEY: Let's check some of the stories breaking this Sunday.Congressman John Larson said earlier on this program that Democrats have the 216 votes necessary to pass health care reform in the House of Representatives. The vote is scheduled for later this afternoon. Republican Congressman Mike Pence said that his party will use every means at their disposal to oppose the measure.It is a weekend of protests here in Washington. Opponents of the health care reform bill gathered outside the U.S. Capitol Saturday demanding that lawmakers kill the bill.Also yesterday, hundreds held a demonstration to mark the seventh anniversary of the Iraq war.And today, as the House votes on health care reform, thousands are expected to gather here in the nation's capital to call on President Obama and Congress to take up immigration reform.North Dakota's Red River is expected to crest today. Several hundred thousand sandbags have been placed along the river's banks to keep the water at bay. So far, flooding has not been as bad as feared.Two weeks after parliamentary elections in Iraq, the vote remains too close to call. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki wants a manual recount. He says he's asking for it to preserve the integrity of the electoral process. So far, preliminary results show the prime minister's coalition is leading in seven of Iraq's 18 provinces.And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his government will not stop building more Jewish settlements in disputed East Jerusalem. Announcement of the move during a recent visit to Israel by Vice President Joe Biden has called a strain in U.S.-Israeli relations. The Obama administration says additional settlements will undermine the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Prime Minister Netanyahu is set to arrive in the U.S. for talks tomorrow.Those are your top stories here on ""State of the Union."" Up next, John King, the man who used to sit in this very room, will be here for a preview of his new 7 p.m. show, ""John King, USA.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CROWLEY: Loyal followers of ""State of the Union"" will want to watch -- in fact, I demand that they watch my colleague, John King's, new broadcast, ""John King, USA."" It premiers tomorrow evening. It's a program with a distinctive look and feel. But this guy, who they're familiar with, let me first -- to start you, though, because you're going to be following this all next week...(CROSSTALK)CROWLEY: We hear -- and probably the week after.KING: And the week after.CROWLEY: John Larson says they got the votes. Do they?KING: Well, one of the deputy whips also said this morning not quite. I believe that -- you know how this works. We will see. Just as they're casting the votes, in the final minutes, there will be three or four people standing in a cluster over here and three or four standing in a cluster over there. They'll be talking to the whips and the leadership sources.And a few of them said, Madam Speaker, if you need me, I'll vote yes, but I'd like to keep my job and I'd prefer to vote no. And so they'll figure it out to the very end. So there -- they would not be doing this if they weren't confident they would get there at the end. There's always a few -- little bit of trading at the end.And then -- and you have had a fascinating discussion about it this morning -- then this becomes a Washington conversation from now to November and, more importantly, an American conversation between now and November. In this midterm election season, you know, sometimes we say this isn't about anything. This is going to be about something huge.CROWLEY: It's amazing, because you really could hear the campaigns revving up, sitting here, because everybody knows this train is -- has left the station and is about to pull up someplace.OK, tell me about the show. I mean, first of all, a whole -- I did watch it online when you did your -- your soft -- what do they call it, soft rollout or whatever that is? Just tell me about it and, like, what the feel is you're going for and what you're hoping to do.KING: On the set, we're trying to be a little bit more relaxed and casual, a little more personal. All my things are on the set. You'll see campaign buttons that I've collected for the last 25 years. You'll see a couple of Fenway Park signs and Red Sox logos. That's who I am.CROWLEY: Surprising.KING: Surprising. But it's like trying to bring somebody in your home or your place in a relaxed way to hopefully have more open and candid conversations. Day-to-day television is a little different from Sunday television. And, you know, I love what you've done with this space on Sunday.And, look, the mission of the program is to do -- take where you start here on Sundays and then project it out in the country. When these guys talk about we're on the side of the American people, let's see if the House and the Senate pass this bill if the American people feel that way between now and November, so we'll go to their communities. We're in their communities this week watching the protests, watching the debates, the phone calls come in to all these offices. We'll do it between now and November. This is one of the things in Washington that can seem like it's an all-Washington confrontation. Health care reform affects everybody; 309 million people in the United States of America will be affected one way or another by this bill, whether they like it or not. So let's cover the big debates here in Washington, but connect them to the impact out in the country. And that's what we're going to try to do.CROWLEY: So when I looked at it online, it really was -- it seems like you're going more for that conversational. It's not your sort of evening news broadcast. Is that the feel of it?KING: I think that's exactly right. It's a news program. It's not a traditional newscast. We want it to be a community and a conversation, not cable conflict, people going at it.If you want to come in -- you can be on the far left and the far right, but come in to have a conversation that is about what's in the bill. Object to the specifics of the policy we're discussing -- discussing, not, say, because you're a D and I'm an R, you're evil and we're just going to yell at each other. Let's come in and let's have a conversation, keep it civil, but it can still be about something.And also we're going to reach out to people who don't live, breathe, eat, and sleep politics in Washington, D.C., but are involved in the process, people who are motivating all those conservatives. Maybe they're tea party people. Maybe they're new faces who are organizing the conservative community.And the same is on the left. As you know, one of the fascinating questions in this campaign, Republicans have the intensity right now, and conservatives -- not always the same thing. Can the left, if they pass this bill -- and that's what a lot of what this is about -- the president trying to say, look, we will lose if we don't get our base back in this election season. One way to try to get them back is to make the tough votes and pass this bill. So that's what we want to track.CROWLEY: ""John King, USA,"" 7 p.m. Eastern tomorrow night. Be sure and watch.KING: Thank you.CROWLEY: We will be there, as well. John and the rest of the best political team on television will also be here this afternoon for today's coverage of the health care vote. And until then, for our international viewers, ""World Report"" is next. For everybody else, ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" starts right now."	1

Eric Cantor says 10,000 baby boomers a day are becoming eligible for benefitsBy Jacob Geiger on Wednesday, May 4th, 2011 at 12:33 p.m.Majority Leader Eric Cantor appeared on CNBC April 26.Amid the pop of champagne at the start of 2011, you many not have noticed the beginnings of a monumental event that will reshape America.The first baby boomers turned 65. Every day this year, and for the next 18 years, multitudes more will turn 65 and begin to rely on the nation’s already-stressed entitlement programs.Baby boomers are Americans born between Jan. 1, 1946 and Dec. 31, 1964. Their 65th birthdays mark the beginning of eligibility for Medicare and fall one year before their full qualification for Social Security.House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has been blanketing cable networks to promote the House GOP budget and the need for major spending cuts. His effort comes as Congress and the president grapple with both the 2012 federal budget and more immediate need to raise the debt ceiling.Appearing on CNBC April 27, Cantor, R-Va., said ""you’ve got each day 10,000 new seniors, baby boomers, becoming eligible for the entitlement programs. Ten thousand a day.""Is Cantor’s number right?We asked Megan Whittemore, Cantor’s press secretary, where the congressman came up with the figure of 10,000 seniors a day becoming eligible for entitlements. She pointed us to a series of statements and reports by the Social Security Administration.In October 2007, when the first baby boomer claimed early retirement benefits from Social Security, the agency put out a press release. Kathleen Casey-Kirschling, born one second after midnight on Jan. 1, 1946, qualified for payments in January 2008, the agency said, adding that ""over the next two decades, nearly 80 million Americans will become eligible for Social Security benefits, more than 10,000 per day.""Social Security allows recipients to start claiming benefits at age 62, though that means accepting a lower monthly payout. The full retirement age for boomers born in 1954 or earlier is 66. It then increases by two months in each of the next six birth years, with everyone born 1960 or later getting full benefits at age 67. Retirees can choose to defer payments up until they’re 70, receiving a larger monthly check in return.The Social Security agency also referred to the 10,000-a-day statistic in its report for fiscal 2012.The Pew Research Center highlighted the statistic in a 2010 study on baby boomers. According to Census data gathered by Pew, 76 million people were born in the United States during the generation. After subtracting those who have already died and adding immigrants born during those years, the Census estimates there are roughly 79.6 million people aged 45 to 64 in America.If you divide 79.6 million by 19 years, then divide that by 365 days, you get 11,478. That’s the number of people, on average, who will turn 65 each day for the next 19 years. Obviously not everyone in that category will live to 65, but the math clearly gives you a figure above the 10,000-a-day cited by Cantor.We also checked the Social Security awards given in 2010. According to the SSA, 4.05 million retired workers or survivors of deceased workers started getting payments last year. That means 11,102 people each day began receiving checks. In 2009 the number was slightly higher, at 11,436 per day.Right now, about 8,600 people a day enter Social Security through the traditional retirement program, and another 3,000 each day through the programs for families of disabled or deceased workers. If the head count climbs up to 11,400 per day through the traditional program, plus another 3,000 per day through the programs for families of disabled or deceased workers, that’s almost a 25 percent increase in the number of Social Security beneficiaries.And consider this: In 1950, as Social Security ramped up, there were 16 workers per recipient. Today there are 2.9 workers per recipient, and by 2041 the SSA says there will be just 2.1 workers per recipient.Let’s review.Rep. Eric Cantor said 10,000 Americans per day become eligible for entitlement programs, meaning Social Security and Medicare.His number are borne out in projections and data from the Social Security Administration. During 2009 and 2010 ,the number of Social Security recipients was actually above 11,000 per day, though many of those people were not retirees.Census data show nearly 80 million baby boomers, born over a span of 19 years. They will turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare at a rate of 11,478 per day. In fact, as of May 3 an estimated 1.4 million people have turned 65 this year.The numbers are staggering. We rate Cantor’s statement True. Advertisement"	0

Scholars have estimated that the number of American families living in extreme poverty, under $2 in cash income, has skyrocketed in the last 20 years.You have about 1.5 million families and 3 million children in this kind of poverty. Given how many children are now in that condition, should we be following the model of countries — like Sweden, Germany, and now Canada under Trudeau — that have a universal child allowance to cut or eliminate child poverty?This is a policy a lot of countries — including Germany, Sweden, and Ireland — have that pays parents a set amount per month, per kid, no strings attached . Other countries, like the UK and Canada, have a version that phases out for more affluent families. Simulations suggest a US version could cut child poverty by more than half .Hillary ClintonWell, this is a very personal and important issue to me — because, as you know, I started out my work as a lawyer for the Children’s Defense Fund. And I have been focused on child poverty and what we can do to alleviate it for a very long time.I would just slightly amend your question, because we were making progress in the ’90s. We had more people lifted out of poverty. We had a 33 percent increase in African-American family income. We were on the right track. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have been looking at more ways to lift more kids out of poverty. But we were on the right trajectory — and, unfortunately, we changed direction.We had policies that I think contributed greatly to the increase in childhood poverty starting in 2001, the Great Recession being the worst of those. But there were also policy decisions, regulatory changes — providing more leeway to the states, so that they did not have either the requirement or the incentive to continue lifting people, particularly kids, out of poverty.Kainaz Amaria/VoxSo we’ve got a big problem, and it’s a problem that’s a reflection on our political as well as our economic systems. And I do think we should focus on how we’re going to support more families, and there are a number of inputs. But trying to create more financial support is something that we should look at. I’m not ready to adopt a plan that comes from some other country, because we have to look to see how we would do anything in our federal system — and how it would be workable and what the cost-benefit analysis might be.But while we’re looking at how we lift incomes — which is the defining economic challenge that we have for working, middle-class, and poor families — we need to do much more to provide the proven interventions in early childhood education that help families, even poor families, know more about how to better prepare their kids. We need to do more with nutrition — and we’re making progress with health care thanks to SCHIP [the State Children’s Health Insurance Program] and the Affordable Care Act.So it’s not just a decision about whether or not to increase the child tax credit or some other means of providing a greater financial safety net. It’s also what we can do to really support families. And I think we have to move on both tracks.Ezra KleinBut to ask a big-picture question about that policy shift: Something a lot of poverty scholars argue to me is that we made a very big change toward trying to support the working poor — welfare reform was, of course, part of that. It went, from the numbers I’ve seen, from bringing a million of these families out of poverty to around 300,000 in more recent years. Then there was the expansion of the EITC.When we say ""welfare reform,"" we’re talking about the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, signed by then-President Bill Clinton. You can read more about its history in Dylan Matthews’s comprehensive explainer .Do you think we do too little now to support the poor who, for whatever reason, cannot find or cannot keep a job?EITC stands for ""earned income tax credit."" It’s effectively a wage subsidy, mostly directed at families with kids, and it’s the biggest refundable credit in the whole tax code. The EITC lifts about 6.2 million people out of poverty , and makes 21.6 million people less poor, every year. Studies show it encourages work, results in major health benefits for mothers and children, and even boosts test scores and earnings for children once they grow up.Hillary ClintonI do. I know there’s a big debate — and it’s an important debate — about welfare reform. Because when welfare reform was passed, there was an expectation — certainly on my part, and I think on the part of many who had supported it — that there would be a requirement that states would have to be contributing to the broadest possible safety net, particularly in economic downturns.So we wouldn’t help the working poor, particularly through the EITC — which I think is one of the best anti-poverty programs that we have devised — at the expense of the poor. We would be providing a continuing safety net for the poor. And that’s one of the programs that I was referring to when I said after 2001, there were a lot of decisions made that basically did not carry on what had been not just the spirit but the requirements in the law, because we had set the base payment at the highest possible rate and expected states to do that.So we are back to a serious problem of poverty, and I think we have to do much more to target federal programs to the poorest, where intergenerational poverty is once again a cycle. Congressman Jim Clyburn has a creative idea called the 10-20-30 approach, where you would put a percentage of federal funds — 10 percent of federal funds — in those communities that are most impoverished and have been for 30 years.So I think we’ve got to address really systemic, generational poverty differently. We still have to lift up working people. We have to make it worth everyone’s while to work. We have to create more good jobs. We still have to have the training pipeline there. But we are now, unfortunately, back having to face poverty that we thought we had a better approach toward ending than it turns out — given the change in administrations and attitudes — that we did.Is it time for more deficit spending?Ezra KleinLet me ask you about how to pay for that. So I looked at the Treasury’s real daily yield curve website today, as I do every morning when I get out of bed. And short-term interest rates on US government debt are negative; they will pay us to take money. That is how much the market wants more US government debt.The Treasury Department sells two kinds of bonds — ones that pay an interest rate tied to the inflation rate, and ones that pay a flat interest rate regardless of inflation. The real yield curve shows the government’s inflation-adjusted cost of borrowing across different time spans.Should we be taking the markets up on this offer of free money? Should we be doing more short-term deficit spending for infrastructure, for poverty, for middle-class tax cuts — and worrying less in the near-term about deficits?Hillary ClintonI think we have missed an opportunity over the last eight years to make some big bets on America — to make some investments with, as you say, money that is as low in terms of interest rates as it’s ever going to be.I have put forth ways of paying for all the investments that I make, because we do have the entitlement issues out there that we can’t ignore. But we are failing to make investments that will make us richer and stronger in the future. And that’s where I think our biggest gap is.I think it’s important that we look for ways to pay for our investments. But I think there can be short-term decisions about the kind of federal dollars that are available now, with a revenue stream to pay them back in the future that would bridge the gap if we can’t do everything we need to do to really give the economy and job creation the kind of boost that it needs.Kainaz Amaria/VoxBut I’m not going to commit myself to that because I would like first to figure out what we’re going to do, because I think we’ve had a period where the gains have gone to the wealthy.The Great Recession wiped out $13 trillion in family wealth. And a lot of people have come back roaring — they are doing better than ever, corporate profits are up, whereas so many Americans are stalled or have fallen backward.Real family income hasn’t moved. In fact, it’s below where it was in 1999 and 2000.So we do have a problem. It’s a real problem. Because we are a 70 percent consumption economy, so we’ve got to get more growth going.And the best way to do that is to invest in these jobs, and I think we can pay for what we need to do through raising taxes on the wealthy and making it clear that there’s a commitment to these investments if we’re going to grow the economy, which will benefit everybody.Ezra KleinI’ve not heard you say it that way before. So part of the argument of doing pay-fors in the near term is not just balancing the budget or reducing the deficit but also bringing distributional fairness to the aftermath of the recession.Hillary ClintonThat’s right. Last summer, I gave two economic speeches which called for strong growth, fair growth, and long-term growth. And I think the three go together.It is important that we look at how they can converge, because I do believe we’ve got to grow the economy. I’m an economic growth Democrat, so I believe that.But we also have to make it fairer, and part of the way we make it fairer is by shifting some of the tax burden onto those who have done really well despite all of the macro- and microeconomic ups and downs in the global economy and here at home. And that’s why the Buffett Rule; that’s why a fair share surcharge on incomes above $5 million; that’s why closing the loopholes, like the carried interest loophole.It’s not just a symbolic effort to say, ""Hey, we gotta get rid of the gimmicks and the games."" It’s also to get money to do what we need to do to lift the bottom and the middle up. And it is a way of making clear that growth and fairness have to go together.Would more immigration be good for the economy?Ezra KleinI think it’s probably an understatement at this point to say that immigration has been a big part of this year’s campaign. We talk a lot about the roughly 11 million unauthorized immigrants who are already here. And I know you’re supportive of comprehensive immigration reform.But there’s a broader question around immigration and the economy: The economic data I’ve seen suggests pretty straightforwardly that immigrants are good for the US economy, particularly as the population ages.The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Senate’s 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill, which would have modestly expanded immigration, would have increased America’s real GDP by 3.3 percent in 2023 and 5.4 percent in 2033. It’s less clear what the effect of radically expanding immigration to the US would be, but some economists estimate that opening borders around the world would double global GDP .So do you think it’d be good for the economy to double or triple the number of people who could come here legally?Hillary ClintonI think we have to deal with first things first. It is certainly the case that immigration has been and continues to be good for our economy. Immigrants start businesses at a faster rate; they seem to grow those businesses more successfully; they do fill certain gaps in skills and knowledge that are good for the overall economy.But I think there are three big problems we have to address. One is just the human cost of those 11 million undocumented immigrants. I have met many of them — in fact, we all have, whether we acknowledge it or not. And these are hardworking people. These are people who are already contributing to the economy, whose children are in schools, who are really absolutely committed to the American dream.The little girl I met in Las Vegas who is living in fear that her parents are going to be deported, she’s got stomachaches and all kinds of physical ailments. And she should be a kid and she should be enjoying school and learning and deciding what she’s going to do. So I do think we have to be very understanding and accepting of the human stories that are behind these statistics that people like Donald Trump throw around.I think also, though, there’s a lot of evidence that moving toward comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship would be good for our economy. We already know that undocumented workers are putting about $12 billion into the Social Security trust fund with no anticipation at this point that they’ll ever get anything out. They’re paying payroll taxes; they’re paying other forms of taxes — state and local as well as federal.So we do have a productive part of our economy, and most of the analysts that I have seen suggest that this idea of deporting everybody would be a severe blow to the economy. That it would cost millions of jobs, that it would depress economic growth. There’s a moral, humanitarian kind of ""American values"" argument, and there’s an economic argument.I think it would be very difficult to do anything on immigration until we make the decision that there will be comprehensive immigration reform. Because otherwise we are mixing up a lot of the concerns about immigration in a way that I think will hurt both the immigrants who fill jobs we need, particularly high-value jobs, and the people who are here living in fear that someone’s going to round them up and deport them.Kainaz Amaria/VoxI think we have to look at all of these issues. Comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship would deal with a lot of these concerns, not just the 11 million people here: how we would regularize them, what kind of steps they’d have to go through. Because I believe they do have to meet certain standards if they’re going to be on a path to citizenship.But I don’t want to mix that with other kinds of changes in visas and other concerns that particularly high-value technical companies have. In fact, I think keeping the pressure on them helps us resolve the bigger problem, and then we can look to see what else, if anything, can and should be done.But I would also add one of the biggest complaints I hear around the country is how callous and insensitive American corporations have become to American workers who have skills that are ones that should make them employable. The many stories of people training their replacements from some foreign country are heartbreaking, and it is obviously a cost-cutting measure to be able to pay people less than you would pay an American worker.I think it’s also a very unfair and sad commentary that we don’t want to invest in training American workers because that’s just ""time-consuming."" And it’s a cost — so even if they could do what we’re wanting them to do, it’s just easier to get someone who will be largely compliant because they want to stay in the country. And that’s just wrong.So there’s work we have to do on all sides of the immigration debate, and I want to see companies have to do more to employ already qualified Americans.Ezra KleinWhy do you think it is that it is so intuitive to people, or so intuitive to many people, that there is a zero-sum competition with immigrants for jobs? As you said, that’s not what the economic evidence shows, but it’s powering a lot of politics in this country.Economists disagree about a lot of the details of immigration, but they uniformly agree that it raises per capita national income by allowing for a more efficient allocation of workers to jobs. Even skeptical economists like George Borjas concede that immigration increases economic growth and that some of the benefits go to natives. More pro-immigration researchers like Giovanni Peri argue that most immigrants complement, rather than substitute for, native-born workers, so even less-skilled natives you might expect to lose out from immigration end up fine.Hillary ClintonI think it’s because everybody with six degrees of separation either knows or thinks they know someone who knows somebody who lost a job to an undocumented worker or to a worker brought over on a visa to do their job. There’s just a lot of churn that suggests this is a real problem.Now, the argument that I have been making is: Look, part of the reason why Americans are agitated about immigration is because they do believe their jobs are being taken out from under them — and there is an unlevel playing field — because if you are employing undocumented workers, and no one is holding you accountable — which we haven’t, we haven’t enforced those laws in a very comprehensive way — then it’s easy to undercut the market. To say, ""Hey, roofer, come down, I’m substituting this man for you. Goodbye. Thank you very much. Here’s your last paycheck."" Because the man they’re putting up there will cost maybe as little as a tenth of the price as the guy who was on the roof.So I think it’s real. It’s hard to argue an economic, analytics abstraction — that really it’s not that much job displacement; and, you know, the overall economy is better; and they’re making these investments in Social Security trust funds — it’s really hard when you’re the one who has lost the job. When you are at Disney in Orlando and you’re told to retrain your successors and then kicked out the door. Or when you’re on a construction site, and all of a sudden you show up the next morning and they tell you they don’t need you anymore because they’ve picked up a bunch of folks at a job corner in the neighborhood. So there’s enough real-world experience that gives people the anxiety that we’re seeing in the political environment.Is it a big job displacement? No. But is it something? Yes. Is it something that is painful and personally hurtful to somebody you know, maybe not you but someone down the line? Absolutely. And I think it’s a mistake to just make the economic argument.I think it’s important that we see the undocumented as people with real stories, with kids who are going to school, with people working 70 to 80 hours a week to have a good life. But it’s also important we see the other side of the story, with people who feel doubly hammered. They feel hammered by global competition, particularly from China taking their jobs, and then they feel hammered from within by employers who are willing to hire undocumented workers and never get held accountable for it.The difficulties of free college and universal health careEzra KleinDuring the debates with Sen. Sanders, you guys clashed on free college. And you made the argument that you did not want to be subsidizing the tuition of Donald Trump’s children, and fair enough.During the primary, both Clinton and Bernie Sanders proposed that the federal government start helping states subsidize colleges. Sanders called for free tuition for all students, while Clinton wanted tuition that students can pay without student loans. Since this interview, Clinton has announced that she wants to make tuition completely free for students from families making less than $125,000 per year.But that argument could also be made on public elementary school, on public high school, on public libraries. So how do you think about when a policy should be universal in nature and when it should be specifically targeted at the needy?Hillary ClintonI think about that in the following way: We have always had a mixed public-private higher education system. And although we do have private schools within elementary and secondary education, they have not been as big a factor as private higher education has been.So what we’re really talking about already is a hybrid system. Because even Sen. Sanders is not talking about subsidizing private higher education. And I think that’s a significant difference. The cost of higher education has always been an individual family responsibility aided by scholarships, grants, work-study programs — the whole mix of ways we enable people to go to college.But we don’t pretend we’re going to do anything for those who choose a private college. Now we let the GI Bill go to either public or private schools; we let Pell Grants go to public or private schools. So we do help to subsidize individuals at private colleges or universities, but we have never taken the position that there is no difference between the two of them. Just like we have a big fight in federal and state legislatures about: Will we subsidize private elementary and secondary education? And with very few exceptions, the answer has been no. That we do believe in the importance of a public education system, so we have adopted these approaches.I had several concerns about Sen. Sanders’s program. I thought it was hard to justify claiming it was free when it was going to have to be paid for by state governments, by a lot of state governments — up to a third of the cost — that were not particularly well-known for supporting higher education. They’ve in fact been disinvesting. And I think it’s more important that we incentivize reinvestment in public higher education.Kainaz Amaria/VoxSo rather than holding out the promise of free college — which wasn’t really free; it was going to be paid for by state and federal dollars — I think it’s important that we say: We’re going to subsidize as far as we can responsibly go. But we’re going to expect states to reinvest in higher education. And I know the arguments that have been made, and [Sanders] was an eloquent advocate for the argument that it should be like Social Security. It never has been; it’s not how we view it; and it would be incredibly expensive to do that as he had proposed. And even he relied on states which had been disinvesting, and we need to reverse that so they start investing.So I want to go as high up the income scale as I can to make sure that middle-class, working, and poor families don’t have to borrow money to go to college. But I don’t want to add the cost of subsidizing me, or subsidizing Donald Trump, at this point. I don’t think that’s a sensible way for us to approach this.Ezra KleinTo ask about another interesting fissure from the primary: You often said that your preference was that we built on Obamacare to get to true universal coverage. And I’ve read your plan around Obamacare, and it doesn’t do that yet. So what would be your approach for taking that program from the roughly 90 percent covered that it’s at now to 100 percent?Hillary ClintonWell, let’s celebrate that we’re at 90 percent coverage. And I think that is one of the differences: I see the glass at 90 percent full, not empty. And [I believe in not] starting over again — either by repealing it, as the Republicans advocate, or by coming up with a whole new plan.So I think it’s tremendous. There was a new Robert Wood Johnson study that pointed out that just in the five years since it’s been implemented, health care spending has gone down $2.6 trillion from the projection that they originally thought it would increase by.So we are really making progress, and I think it is important to build on that progress. We have 20 million people who are now in the Affordable Care system. We’ve expanded Medicaid, which I want to see expanded in every state that hasn’t, because I think that was an ideological rather than economic or moral decision. And I want us to build on the Affordable Care Act.Kainaz Amaria/VoxNow, how are we going to do that? We’re going to have to be clear about the competition that is needed to keep costs more reasonable. It is going to require us to take a hard look at premiums, copays, deductibles, and see what we can do to limit the kind of additional costs — particularly for prescription drugs — that policyholders have under the exchanges.We have got to encourage more competition. Not just by working with the existing insurers but really trying to open the door — more successfully than was achieved — to other forms of insurance. The cooperative insurance plan hasn’t worked in most places, but it’s worked in some places. What are the lessons we can learn from that?So I’m actually very excited about this, and I think we will get to 100 percent coverage. And I think we will do it by building on people spending their own dollars and by our subsidies.And it is a much more acceptable, less disruptive approach than starting over and trying to impose a single-payer system — because, remember, the vast majority of Americans are getting their health insurance through their employment. There’s very little evidence they are unsatisfied by it. I certainly saw that firsthand when I was working on this back in ’93 and ’94. And I favor a public option so we can try to lower the costs even further for people who have a larger risk of bad health problems.Ezra KleinShould that public option be able to link with Medicare to bargain down prices?The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that a public option would cut Obamacare's price by $158 billion over a decade, by offering consumers a nonprofit health plan with lower premiums.Hillary ClintonI think it’s going to be something we’ll have to look at. I have long been in favor of giving Medicare the authority to bargain. And I voted for it; I’ve spoken out for it—Ezra KleinYou mean on prescription drugs?Hillary ClintonOn prescription drugs. And if it were to be a broader public option, maybe there as well. Because it is clear that we don’t have enough bargaining power yet to deal with some of the big cost drivers, like prescription drugs, that are still not reacting the way we had hoped that they would.In fact, there’s a lot of new gimmicks to try to drive up the cost of prescription drugs. But I’m actually optimistic. I think we’re on the right track with the Affordable Care Act. And of course we’re going to have to make adjustments. We did with every other program that people now defend and love, and we're going to do it with the Affordable Care Act.What skills does a president need that campaigns don’t test?Ezra KleinWe’ve talked about a number of policies here — but not so much about how to get them done. What are the qualities you think you possess that are needed for an effective presidency that aren’t rewarded or revealed by the campaign trail?Hillary ClintonWell, I think a lot of governing is the slow, hard boring of hard boards. I don’t think there’s anything sexy, exciting, or headline-grabbing about it. I think it is getting up every day, building the relationships, finding whatever sliver of common ground you can occupy, never, ever giving up in continuing to reach out even to people who are sworn political partisan adversaries.I’ve seen it work. I’ve seen it work. And I’ve been part of seeing it and making it work. I really believe there’s no shortcut; there’s no quick answer. Now, if there’s a major national disaster — like the Great Recession — you could get things done that you couldn’t otherwise. And you have to seize those moments, and I think President Obama did that.But I think you’ve got to try to push forward as many different issues as you can all at the same time, because you never know what’s going to turn the tide. So I just think it’s getting up every day and working on it. It is not flashy, and you don’t telegraph everything you’re doing, because that would be breaching the relationship and the negotiation that you may be involved in.I certainly saw my husband do it, and he did it with people who were trying to destroy him. Every single day, he’d meet with them at night; they’d hammer out deals; they would negotiate over very difficult things; they’d shut the government down; he’d veto them; they’d come back. You just keep going.Because we’re dealing with a hyperpartisan opposition who has decided their ideology is more important than actually getting results — either for their constituents or for their country. They really have put ideology above everything else. I don’t know all the reasons — I’m going to wait for a smart political scientist to explain it all to me — but it makes the negotiating harder.Back in the ’90s, after criticizing Bill all day, Newt Gingrich would come over to the White House at 9 o’clock and they’d negotiate for a couple of hours.And certainly with the work that I did on the Children’s Health Insurance Program and the work I did as a senator — I worked with people who were very much political opponents, but we found that common ground. And the same as secretary of state. I had to round up, I think, 13 Republicans to pass the New START treaty. And you just keep working at it. It takes a lot of effort, but if you’re persistent you can get things done.Ezra KleinThe background for that is a real structural rise in partisanship and division. Barack Obama is the most polarizing president since we began polling; before him, it was George Bush; before him, Bill Clinton.Both you and Donald Trump begin as the least favorably viewed major party nominees since we began polling. What do you think are the background drivers of the higher polarization, higher bitterness, that seems to afflict politicians of both parties now?Hillary ClintonI think there are a number of factors. Again, I’m not sure I totally understand it all. The media environment — particularly the social media environment — drives negativity. It’s what captures eyeballs. It’s what gets people to tune in or log on. It is just human nature.Saying something negative about somebody, whether it was a negative ad 30 years ago or a negative tweet or other allegations today — there’s just a really rich environment for that to capture people’s minds and change their attitudes.There’s a lot of behavioral science that if you attack someone endlessly — even if none of what you say is true — the very fact of attacking that person raises doubts and creates a negative perspective. As someone Exhibit A on that — since it has been a long time that I’ve been in that position — I get that. I get it.And it’s always amusing to me that when I have a job, I have really high approval ratings; when I’m actually doing the work, I get reelected with 67 percent of the vote running for reelection in the Senate. When I’m secretary of state, I have [a] 66 percent approval rating.And then I seek a job, I run for a job, and all of the discredited negativity comes out again, and all of these arguments and attacks start up. So it seems to be part of the political climate now that is just going to have to be dealt with.But I am really confident that I can break through that and I can continue to build an electoral victory in November. And then once I’m doing the job, we’ll be back to people viewing me as the person doing the job instead of the person seeking the job.Look, I’m not making any special plea, because it’s just reality. But every recent study has shown that if you take all of the media and all of the Republicans and all of the independent expenditures, tens of millions of dollars of negative attacks have been run against me. And that’s just something I’ve learned to live with, and I don’t pay a lot of attention to it anymore.Ezra KleinDo you think you get pulled along that slipstream? I think here of the debate when you say you were proud of having Republicans as enemies.During a Democratic debate in October , Clinton said that the person or group she’s proudest to have as an enemy is ""probably the Republicans.""Do you think part of this environment has put you in a place of feeding it and running more negative campaigns?Hillary ClintonNot very much. I mean, you can go back and look at how I’ve worked with Republicans, and I think I have a very strong base of relationships with them and evidence of that. But, you know, they say terrible things about me, much worse than anything I’ve ever said about them. That just seems to be part of the political back and forth now — to appeal to your base, to appeal to the ideologues who support you.We have become so divided, and we’ve got to try to get people back listening to each other and trying to roll up our sleeves and solve these problems that we face, and I think we can do that.What’s on Hillary’s bookshelf?Ezra KleinI know we have to let you go, and I’ll ask you this one final question. What are three books that have influenced how you think about policy that you think everyone should read?Hillary ClintonOh, my gosh, there are so many I’ve read over the years. I wrote one called It Takes a Village, which I highly recommend—Ezra KleinYou can’t plug your own book.Kainaz Amaria/VoxHillary Clinton[Laughs] I think there’s a lot of wisdom in Bob Putnam’s latest book, Our Kids. I think there’s a really great story that he tells about going back to the town he grew up in outside of Cleveland, where kids of all different backgrounds, economic family standing, and they’re all together and everyone was in it together. And there was so little distinction, and there was so much economic integration in that small town.Now he goes back to it, and it’s so divided. It’s divided on income; it’s divided on race; it’s just a very different environment. And winners and losers are preordained at a very early age. So I think that’s a book that people should read right now.I think that a lot of Christopher Lasch’s work and Alan Wolfe’s work and Habits of the Heart — that wonderful old sociological work that was led by Robert Bellah — are also really helpful. Because we need to be reminded of what is unique about the American experience. De Tocqueville saw it. Habits of the Heart came from his writings, and you can see how more difficult it is in a 24/7, 360-degree media environment to find the time to think, to breathe, to spend relaxation hours getting to know people.We just don’t do that. We don’t build relationships; we don't, on the Republican-Democratic divide in Washington, spend any time with each other — even less than what I did when I was there, and that wasn’t that long ago. So I think looking at writings both by political scientists and sociologists about how America worked well and trying to sort through what did we lose that has made it so hard for people to even listen to each other.And I do think — and I keep saying this, because I believe it — I think the media environment where people are rewarded for being outrageous, for yelling at each other, for saying things that are untrue without being held accountable for it has contributed to this attitude of divisiveness and separation. And I regret that.I think people — maybe it’s not the media’s role to say, ""Well, wait a minute, that’s just not right."" I mean, it was shocking when CNN fact-checked some of Donald Trump’s sayings the other day. But it’s hard for the average viewer or listener to do that himself, and there is no guide any longer. It’s just not easy to sort out what you’re being told.And if people are being addressed in their fear — as opposed to their openness, their tolerance, their hopefulness — it just creates an even more hardened view about whether we can work with each other or not. And I worry about that; I worry it is undermining our democracy.A democracy relies on the glue of trust. You don’t have to agree with me. But I do have to believe, whether it’s an economic transaction or my vote, that there’s a certain expectation. That, yeah, there are people who go off the rails — everybody’s not what they pretend to be, we all know that. But in general, there’s got to be that rock-solid belief that this transaction between us as voters and citizens rests on something deep and sacred. And I don’t know how we get back to that.Why America stopped trusting elites — and what elites should do about itEzra KleinThe invocation of trust there I think is really interesting. You bring up the media. We are one of many institutions that the public, if you look at the polling, has lost trust in tremendously over the last 50 years. They’ve lost trust in their politicians; they’ve lost trust in business; they’ve lost trust in the media.So when you say that there are gatekeepers who should fact-check — and at Vox, we do a lot of fact-checking — but one issue is that people don’t listen anymore. Why do you think there’s been such a systemic loss of trust across so many different institutions all at once? How do you explain that change in America?Hillary ClintonWell, because I really believe that none of us has done what we should have done in being really straightforward about what we know and what we don’t know. And being willing to say, ""We reported that story last week; it turns out we were wrong."" Or, ""We didn’t tell you everything you might have needed to make a decision.""I’ve argued with network executives for 25 years that somebody is going to really figure out that running a news program where you actually say, ""Hey, we got that wrong,"" or, ""I’m not so sure what he just said was right, and I don’t think it is and let me tell you why, and here’s the evidence to that effect."" [A program] where someone is trying to pull the curtain back, as opposed to everyone going back to their corners, whether it’s ratings or whether it’s an ideological position — that’s really what we’re about.As opposed to, ""We have a really solemn responsibility, and we’re going to level with you. You may not like what you hear, but we’re going to try to the best of our ability not to get it wrong. And when we do, we’re going to be the first to tell you.""I think politicians — look at the nonsense that people say running for office, just ridiculous stuff, and they get away with it because there’s no big gong that rings; ""Oh, my God, look what so-and-so just said."" But there should be some reward for trying to get it right and for trying to correct it when you get it wrong. And maybe it’s just too threatening — whether you’re in politics, business, media, wherever you are — maybe it’s too threatening to admit that.I don’t know how we’re going to rebuild the trust, because it really starts with saying, ""Hey, I made a mistake,"" or, ""I didn’t get it right,"" or, ""Hey, I’ve got more information, and let me tell you,"" and just doing it in a very matter-of-fact way.Kainaz Amaria/VoxCreditsDirector: Joe Posner; Camera: Carlos Waters, Julia Wall; Stills photographer: Kainaz Amaria; Gaffer: Paul Lowery; Studio operations: Andrew Scott Willis, Sarah Bishop; Editors: Laura McGann, Sarah Kliff, Susannah Locke, Allison Rockey, Kay Steiger; Video editing & animation: Joe Posner; Developers: Yuri Victor, Ryan Mark; Designers: Sanette Tanaka, Tyson Whiting; Charts: Javier Zarracina; Project managers: Susannah Locke, Katie O’Dowd; Transcription: Jeff Stein; Transcript annotations: Sarah Kliff, Dara Lind, Dylan Matthews, Libby Nelson, Andrew Prokop, Jeff Stein, Matthew Yglesias; Copy editor: Tanya Pai; QA: Jon Douglas, Nancy Seay.All images made in Raleigh, North Carolina on June 22.A Vox Media Storytelling Studio collaboration"	1

The online petitions — created on the We the People platform at petitions.whitehouse.gov — are required to receive 25,000 signatures in 30 days for the White House to respond. The Texas petition, created Nov. 9 by a man identified as Micah H. of Arlington, had received more than 116,000 signatures by Friday. It asks the Obama administration to “peacefully grant” the withdrawal of Texas, and describes doing so as “practically feasible,” given the state’s large economy. Residents in other states, including Alabama, Florida, Colorado, Louisiana and Oklahoma, have submitted similar petitions, though none have received as many signatures as the one from Texas. A White House official said every petition that crossed the signature threshold would be reviewed and would receive a response, though it was unclear precisely when Micah H. would receive his answer.

Rick Perry, who twice made public remarks in 2009 suggesting that he was sympathetic to the secessionist cause, will not be signing the petition. “Governor Perry believes in the greatness of our union, and nothing should be done to change it,” a spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, said in a statement. The secession movement in Texas is divergent, with differences in goals and tactics. One group, the Republic of Texas, says that secession is unnecessary because, it claims, Texas is an independent nation that was illegally annexed by the United States in 1845. (The group’s leader and other followers waged a weeklong standoff with the Texas Rangers in 1997 that left one of its members dead.) Mr. Kilgore, the candidate who is changing his middle name, said he had not signed the White House petition because he did not believe that Texans needed to ask Washington for permission to leave. “Our economy is about 30 percent larger than that of Australia,” said Mr. Kilgore, 48, a telecommunications contractor. Few of the public calls for secession have addressed the messy details, like what would happen to the state’s many federal courthouses, prisons, military bases and parklands. No one has said what would become of Kevin Patteson, the director of the state’s Office of State-Federal Relations, and no one has asked the Texas residents who received tens of millions of dollars in federal aid after destructive wildfires last year for their thoughts on the subject. But all the secession talk has intrigued liberals as well. Caleb M. of Austin started his own petition on the White House Web site. He asked the federal government to allow Austin to withdraw from Texas and remain part of the United States, “in the event that Texas is successful in the current bid to secede.” It had more than 8,000 signatures as of Friday.

During the 2008 presidential campaign, PolitiFact rated one campaign ad as Half True because it implied she’d single-handedly ""stood up for universal health care when almost no one else would."" In another instance, we rated her comment True because she qualified her claim, saying she ""helped"" create the children’s health coverage program -- along with others.Let’s revisit the facts.It's correct that the Children’s Health Insurance Program -- known as CHIP -- provides health care coverage to more than 8 million children, according to Medicaid . Created in 1997, when it was known as the State Children's Health Insurance Program, it promotes health coverage for low-income children by providing federal funding to states. The current ad gives Clinton credit for ""winning"" legislation that congressional lawmakers passed when she was first lady.Her campaign website has a more nuanced statement: ""As first lady, she refused to give up when Congress defeated health care reform. Instead, she worked with Republicans and Democrats to help create the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which now provides health coverage to more than 8 million children. Senator Ted Kennedy said that if not for Hillary, the Children’s Health Insurance Program wouldn’t be in existence today.""The late-Sen. Kennedy received much of the credit for CHIP because the Massachusetts Democrat shepherded the legislation through a Republican-controlled Congress. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch was the lead Republican co-sponsor.""The children's health program wouldn't be in existence today if we didn't have Hillary pushing for it from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue,"" Kennedy said.Nick Littlefield, a senior health adviser to Kennedy at the time, agreed.""She wasn't a legislator, she didn't write the law, and she wasn't the president, so she didn't make the decisions,"" Littlefield told the Associated Press. ""But we relied on her, worked with her and she was pivotal in encouraging the White House to do it.""But the new Clinton ad has no qualifiers, stating ""she's the one who's proven she can get it done… winning health care for 8 million children.""Our rulingA Clinton campaign ad says one of her accomplishments was ""winning health care for 8 million children.""That statement is largely accurate. Clinton was key to creating the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which provides coverage for 8 million children. But the ad leaves out the contributions of others.Because of that caveat, we rate her statement Mostly True. Advertisement"	0

Kagan has apparently wanted to be a judge or justice since adolescence (she posed in judicial robes for her high school yearbook). There was a brief period, in her early 20s, when she expressed opinions on legal and political matters. But that seems to have ended pretty quickly. She has become a legal scholar without the interest scholars normally have in the contest of ideas. She’s shown relatively little interest in coming up with new theories or influencing public debate. Her publication record is scant and carefully nonideological. She has published five scholarly review articles, mostly on administrative law and the First Amendment.

In 2005, for example, she delivered a lecture on women and the legal profession. If ever there was a hot-button issue, it’s the mommy wars, the tension between professional success and family pressures. Kagan deftly summarized some of the research showing that while women do well in law school, they are not as likely to rise to senior positions at major firms. But she didn’t exactly take a stand. “What I hope to do is start a conversation,” she said. Kagan’s sole display of passion came during her defense of her decision to reinstate a policy that banned the military from using Harvard Law School’s main career office for recruiting. But even here, she argues that her position was not the product of any broad opinions. She was upholding the antidiscrimination regulations of Harvard University. She told the Senate in written answers to questions during her confirmation hearings for solicitor general, “The position I took does not entail a view on the exclusion of R.O.T.C. from college campuses, and I never expressed a position on the exclusion of R.O.T.C. What we have is a person whose career has dovetailed with the incentives presented by the confirmation system, a system that punishes creativity and rewards caginess. Arguments are already being made for and against her nomination, but most of this is speculation because she has been too careful to let her actual positions leak out. There’s about to be a backlash against the Ivy League lock on the court. I have to confess my first impression of Kagan is a lot like my first impression of many Organization Kids. She seems to be smart, impressive and honest — and in her willingness to suppress so much of her mind for the sake of her career, kind of disturbing.

The junior high and high school dismissed at 11 a.m., and elementary schools ended their days at noon. The district said parents could use their own judgment about keeping children home.Related HeadlinesWesley Wilson, who has three grandchildren in the school district, said he thought the early dismissal was a wise choice. He said he was preparing for the worst, but expected the best ahead of Trump's visit. ""It's going to be a lot of mixed emotions in that,"" Wilson said. ""There's a lot of people that just don't care for Donald Trump and something might spill over."" Duss Avenue in front of the high school was all that separated Trump supporters and protesters, but it appeared to be enough, as the two sides remained peaceful. “This is my high school, and the fact that Trump is coming here is unbelievable. He’s been my hero since he started this campaign,” Trump supporter Josh Miller said. “I think it’s absolutely terrible. Ambridge High School is a school with many different races, of many different people (and) of many different religions,” Trump protester Bennett Lefebvre said. While thousands of supporters lined the streets to see Trump in person, many were only able to get a glimpse. Trump gave a quick wave to the crowd outside as he arrived, but many supporters were forced to watch on a screen in the parking lot, as the fire marshal turned them away to the door. A Gold Star family who drove four hours from Ohio to Ambridge was among those denied entry despite having tickets. “If I can’t hear the man live and they don’t respect Gold Star, then they don’t respect anybody,” Edward Mitchell said. While supporters were excited to see the man they plan to vote for next month, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton dominated much of the conversation. Trump supporters, including Vic Schueckler, wore ""Deplorable"" buttons, a reference to how Clinton referred to some of Trump’s supporters last month. “This button says, ‘Deplorable'? I’m hard of hearing. I thought she said 'adorable,’” Schueckler said.Despite being significantly outnumbered, protesters made sure their voices were heard, too. “He’s a bully. We teach our kids, like my 5-year-old, not to be a bully. I wanted to be here to show I’m not happy with this,” protester Connie Mabin said. Inside the field house, Trump entered waving a Terrible Towel, and the crowd of more than 3,000 went wild. ""I will never stop fighting against the Washington establishment that has betrayed each and every one of you, betrayed the country,” Trump said. He dug in right away, talking about the 2005 tape that came out Friday in which he made disparaging remarks about women. RELATED: Trump apologizes for vulgar talk about women in 2005 recording “I'm not proud of everything I’ve done in life. Who among us is? Is anybody proud of every single element?” Trump said. Fresh off Sunday night's debate, Trump also doubled down on his attacks on Clinton. ""Hillary Clinton doesn't have a clue about how to bring back jobs. I can tell you that. She doesn't have a clue,” he said. Trump supporters told Channel 11 News that they like the way he talks about immigration, jobs and building a wall, and added that the remarks he made 11 years ago didn’t cause them to change their minds about supporting him. Trump wrapped up his visit to Western Pennsylvania by stopping at the Eat’n Park in Moon Township. He bought a dozen Smiley cookies with former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who introduced Trump at the Ambridge rally. "	0

It says he will:""Force Christian organizations to pay for abortions.""""Force employers to give illegal immigrants the jobs of U.S. citizens.""""Force police agencies to allow Muslim brotherhood to select staff."""" Force creation of a permanent government funded ‘underclass.’ ""It’s from a political action committee that operates under the name ""Government is Not God,"" or GING-PAC for short. The group claims the ad has run in 19 newspapers in Florida, Ohio, Iowa and Pennsylvania.Compared with other outside spending groups, GING-PAC is a relatively small player. It started in 1994 and has spent less than $100,000 in most elections, supporting Republicans such as House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Missouri U.S. Rep. Todd Akin. (Akin is the Senate candidate who said women rarely get pregnant from ""legitimate rape."")The group’s latest ad found its largest audience when it ran in the Sarasota Herald-Tribune on Sunday. The Herald-Tribune, citing policy, would not disclose the ad’s cost. The ad has also reportedly run in Florida newspapers that serve Bonifay, Cross City, Gilchrist, Madison and Winter Haven.The ad’s claims riled some voters in Sarasota, including Kindra Muntz, an activist who previously worked to get Florida’s electronic voting replaced with paper ballots. She’s organizing a protest in front of the newspaper’s offices Sept. 27, 2012.""It’s an insult to people’s intelligence, really. ... It steps on just about everyone, and drags them into somebody’s hate agenda,"" Muntz said.On Wednesday, the Herald-Tribune apologized in a note to readers, stating that the ad did not meet the newspaper’s ""standards for fairness and accuracy.""Here at PolitiFact, we wondered if the ad’s claims had any merit. We looked into them, except one that was too vague to analyze, that Obama would ""force creation of a permanent government funded 'underclass.'"" All the ratings are here; some we've also expanded into separate fact-checks.We contacted GING-PAC and asked for evidence for the group’s claims. William J. Murray said the group didn’t need evidence because it was making predictions.""If a politician is willing to walk you halfway to hell, it is likely that he will walk you the rest of the way there,"" Murray said via email.The ad's claims are not couched as predictions, however, but as representations of Obama's actual policies and proposals. We've fact-checked their points by comparing them with Obama's previous positions, his proposals for a second term, and his public comments.""Force police agencies to allow Muslim brotherhood to select staff""We found nothing in Obama’s stated policies or positions to support this claim. Still, we ran it by Phil Lynn, director of the National Law Enforcement Policy Center, a division of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. He said he’d never heard of the claim, and that most states and local agencies have boards that control hiring and firing decisions.""Trying to force this on local jurisdictions would be irregular and out of place,"" Lynn said. ""I would think many states would balk at it.""Such an idea is not only unconstitutional, it’s also ridiculous, said Howard Simon, executive director of the ACLU of Florida.""It just doesn’t make any sense,"" said Howard Simon. ""It’s incoherent that a police agency would give an outside group the power to pick its own staff.""We found no evidence that Obama’s ever mentioned anything like this. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.""Force doctors to assist homosexuals in buying surrogate babies""Experts who follow issues involving same-sex couples and parenthood were perplexed by this one. ""We have no idea what this claim is based on,"" said Eleanor Nicoll, public affairs manager for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.Plus, buying babies is illegal. We rate this one Pants on Fire.""Force employers to give illegal immigrants the jobs of U.S. citizens""This is a preposterous claim that, in one interpretation, suggests that Obama wants to deny jobs to U.S. citizens and give them to illegal immigrants. We’re not sure how that would even work. Would employers be forced to seek out illegal immigrants, verify their legal status, hire them and then confirm that they took the jobs of legal citizens?If anything, the Obama administration’s record shows an increasingly tougher stance on the hiring of unauthorized workers. The number of employers hit with penalties rose more than 20-fold, from 18 in 2008 to 385 in 2011. In the same period, total fines increased from $675,000 to $9.2 million. Use of the electronic employee verification system, E-Verify, quadrupled , from 88,000 employers in 2008 to 354,000 in 2012.GING-PAC points to the president’s executive order to defer deportation of illegal immigrants under 30 who have no criminal record, have graduated or are in school and have lived in the country for more than five years. The Pew Hispanic Center estimates that 700,000 18 to 30-year-olds might be immediately eligible and could apply for the two-year work permits. Over time, the number would rise to 1.7 million. Bob Dane with the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that favors stronger immigration controls, said this could put these people in competition for jobs.""The people will still be illegal,"" Dane said. ""And they would be taking a job from a U.S. citizen.""Things could go that way. But there’s still nothing forcing employers to hire anyone except who they want. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.""Force states to pay the college tuition of illegal immigrants' children""This claim conflates several issues related to immigration. To begin with, children of illegal immigrants born in the United States are citizens. A federal court recently overturned a Florida law that denied in-state tuition to the citizen children of illegal immigrants who were Florida residents. Immigration experts said the federal government couldn’t force states to pay college tuition for immigrants -- or for any other students, for that matter. We rate this claim False.""Force all states to permit same-sex 'marriages' ""The ad’s basis for this is the president’s opposition to the Defense of Marriage Act, the federal law that defines marriage as between a man and woman.Is opposing the law the same thing as wanting to force all states to permit same-sex marriages? Not according to Obama. ""I continue to believe that this is an issue that is gonna be worked out at the local level, because historically, this has not been a federal issue,"" he said in a May interview, adding, ""I think it is a mistake to try to make what has traditionally been a state issue into a national issue.""Even if Obama changed his mind, he would have to introduce legislation in Congress to require states to recognize gay marriages. And even if that passed, it would likely be unconstitutional, according to Dale Carpenter, a civil rights professor at the University of Minnesota. ""The court has explicitly said that family law is a matter for states to decide,"" he said. We rate the ad’s claim False.""Force Christian organizations to pay for abortions""Under the 2010 health care law, Christian organizations won’t be ""forced"" to hand over money for abortion procedures performed at clinics by doctors. But the law does expand coverage requirements for preventive care. And preventive care, as defined by the Obama administration, includes birth control, emergency contraceptives and sterilization -- and some people equate those services with abortion.The administration created an exemption for religious organizations by requiring insurance companies to pay for those services. But anti-abortion groups say the exemption is just a shell game. That controversy is real, but the ad’s claim creates a misleading impression. We rate the claim Mostly False.""Force Christian schools to hire non-Christian teachers""The only basis for this claim is a 2012 Supreme Court decision involving a teacher who said she lost her job in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. She sued to get her job at a private Christian school back. The federal government supported her case, but the court unanimously ruled against her on First Amendment grounds.The case, Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School vs. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, did address the proper balance between the government and religious institutions in personnel decisions at schools. But even participants in the case say it had nothing to do with ordering schools to hire people. We rate this claim False.""Force courts to accept Islamic Sharia Law in domestic disputes""There have been isolated instances when U.S. courts have used sharia law. But we couldn’t find any instances of the Obama administration supporting that.On top of that, the notion would violate the separation of powers, said Glenn Hendrix, an Atlanta-based attorney and past chair of the American Bar Association’s section on International Law.

In 2011, it set up camp in New York City’s Zuccotti Park and then spread to other cities.Protesters have a First Amendment right to peaceably assemble, but local governments are generally allowed to enforce time and place restrictions on those gatherings. A 1984 Supreme Court opinion said governments may outlaw sleeping in parks, even during protests.We couldn’t find any evidence that Obama or his administration opposed existing law on this point.

And indeed, we did find video of him paraphrasing that famous line, leaving out the ""creator."" Several conservative websites appear to be tracking his omissions.But there’s also video evidence of him saying those words -- the blog of the liberal group People for the American Way even put together a compilation video of Obama reciting the ""endowed by their creator"" language.

Seemed like pretty good evidence that the alternative might be true: in the White House’s preferred world, military chaplains wouldn’t be able to refuse!The reality? The Defense Department already protects chaplains from performing ceremonies that contradict their religious beliefs. The defense bill provision (which didn’t pass) was much broader — which is why the White House opposed it.

Dave Brat says President Barack Obama’s inauguration ushered in an era of sticky red tape.""Since President Obama took office in January 2009, the federal government has issued more than 468,500 pages of regulations,"" Brat, R-7th wrote in a March 17 statement heralding the release of a House GOP budget. Brat said the Republican plan takes aim at the ""overwhelming amount"" of rules enacted under Obama.We wondered if it’s true that the U.S. has issued nearly a half million pages of regulations since Obama took the oath on Jan. 20, 2009.Brian Gottstein, a spokesman for Brat, told us the 468,500 figure comes from the GOP budget. The same page count also was cited in a Dec. 31, 2014 column in the Washington Examiner.The figure refers to the number of pages that were published in the Federal Register, a daily journal of the U.S. government that contains agency rules, proposed rules and public notices. Although rarely read by the general public, the Register is valuable to lawyers, lobbyists and policy wonks tracking the activities of agencies.In each edition, the Register posts a running tally of the pages printed so far the year. The final total at the end of December is often used as a gauge of regulatory activity during the year.Brat’s figure gives the total Register pages from Jan. 1, 2009 through Dec. 31, 2014. We tallied the total from the Jan. 20, 2009 start of Obama’s term through March 17, 2015, when Brat made his statement, and found there were 481,827 pages printed. So Brat slightly underestimated the volume under Obama.During the comparable period of former President George W. Bush’s term, the Register published 465,948 pages.But there’s a catch to these numbers. Many of these pages didn’t contain regulations. That’s because the Register also includes notices about agency meetings and public comment periods, presidential documents and other items that are not considered rules.Over the last 10 years, 58 percent of the Register’s pages have dealt with regulations, according to figures from the National Archives and Records Administration. Of almost 768,000 pages published during that span, 32 percent dealt with final regulations and 26 percent concerned proposed regulations.Overall Register page counts ""may not be an accurate proxy for regulatory activity or measure of regulatory burden for several reasons,"" the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in November 2014 report .CRS noted that many of the pages ""typically have little, if anything to do with federal regulations."" And it said that many of the pages dealing with final rules don’t contain any regulatory language but rather record a ""preamble"" that has lengthy explanations about public comments on the rule. The CRS noted, for example, that a 2013 rule enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act filled 137 pages. But only 16 pages detailed the rule itself.Some rule changes are relatively routine, and some are temporary, CRS said. Any moves an agency makes to deregulate by eliminating a rule or streamlining it also have to be published in the Register.Cary Coglianese, a law professor and director of the Penn Program on Regulation at the University of Pennsylvania, said the Register page count is often cited because it’s easy to find.""I wouldn’t use it as an indication of the level of regulation because it’s so prone to having so much else in it,"" Coglianese said. ""The other thing to keep in mind is, just because you know something about the number of pages, (that) doesn’t tell you the wisdom of having those pages. It might be those pages are helping to save people’s lives or keeping banks from failing or airplanes from crashing.""Peter Van Doren, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, is also leery of citing the page count, emailing us that it’s his ""least favorite"" way to measure regulation.Other analysts have written op-eds using the overall page count to give an idea of the country’s regulatory environment, including one from the conservative American Enterprise Institute and another from the Cato Institute. James Gattuso, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told PolitiFact Virginia for a 2011 article that the annual page count ""as a very broad measure"" indicates more regulatory activity now compared to past years.Here’s some further insight: There have been an average of 6,113 final and proposed rules published each year during the first six years of Obama’s term compared to 6,536 during the same span in Bush’s term.The Government Accountability Office tracks the number of ""major rules"" enacted. These essentially are regulations that have an annual economic effect of $100 million or more.During the first six years of Obama’s term, 485 major regulations were published compared to 333 during the same time period under Bush.Our rulingBrat said under Obama, the federal government has issued an 468,500 pages of regulations.The congressman is referring to the number pages published in the Federal Register since 2009. While Brat is right on the page count, he omits important information. Many of those pages don’t concern regulations at all, but are simply notices, executive orders and statements from agencies discussing public comments about a planned rule.About 58 percent of the pages deal with proposed and final regulations. About 32 percent of the pages detail rules that were actually enacted by the White House. Those who believe Washington is too intrusive may be unswayed these distinctions, but it’s Brat who chooses to describe regulation in terms of pages and his eye-popping number overstates the sheer volume of rules Obama has put in place.We rate his claim Mostly False.Advertisement"	0

(END VIDEO CLIP)ANNOUNCER: From all across our world to the heart of our nation'scapital, ABC ""This Week"" with Christiane Amanpour starts now. AMANPOUR: Good morning. This was supposed to be the summer ofrecovery, but the effects of the so-called Great Recession continue tocloud this nation and much of the world. The number of U.S. workersseeking unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly to 484,000. It's theworst in almost six months. And in the housing sector, banks foreclosedon more than 90,000 properties in July, the second-highest total sincethe crisis began. And these pictures speak to the desperation this week in Atlanta. Thirty thousand people waited for hours in sweltering heat to apply for655 available spots of government-subsidized housing. And I'm joined by four top voices on the economy. From Berkeley,California, member of the president's Economic Recovery Advisory BoardLaura Tyson. From Chattanooga, Tennessee, Republican Senator Bob Corkerof the Banking Committee. In New York, the former New Jersey governorand CEO of MF Global, Jon Corzine. And joining us here in Washington,chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Martin Regalia. Thank you all for joining me. You've heard the figures. You'veread about the figures. You can also probably palpably feel the concernand worry amongst the American people. And I want to read you somethingthat was written about this joblessness, about the younger generation inthe Atlantic recently. Look at what was written about unemployment. ""There is unemployment -- a brief and relatively routinetransitional state that results from the rise and fall of companies inany economy, and there is unemployment -- chronic, all-consuming. Theformer is a necessary lubricant in any engine of economic growth. Thelatter is a pestilence that slowly eats away at people, families, and,if it spreads widely enough, the fabric of society. Indeed, historysuggests that this is perhaps society's most noxious ill."" Let me turn to you right now, Martin Regalia. Do you agree withthat? And do you think that that's what this country is in right now? REGALIA: Well, I agree with it, and I think that is what we'reseeing right now. We're seeing an economy that is growing, but growingin a very lackluster way. It's not generating enough demand, andtherefore it's not generating enough jobs. And on top of that, the last three or four recessions have givenrise to longer terms of unemployment. More retooling is necessary tobring the displaced workers back into the workforce, and that retoolingis taking a lot longer. AMANPOUR: Let me turn to you, Laura Tyson. You're an adviser tothe president right now. A recent Wall Street Journal poll of some 53economists say they don't see the employment rate coming down below 9percent, you know, at least until June 2011. What can be done about this? TYSON: Well, I think that we have to do a number of things. Ithink we have to worry, first of all, about taking care of the peoplewho are unemployed. And that's why I really have supported theextension of unemployment benefits and the extension of benefits to helppeople maintain their health insurance if they lose their job, very,very important. You have to deal with the reality that people arelong-term unemployed, 7 million people long-term unemployed. Secondly, we have to continue to do everything we can to stimulatedemand in the economy. Let me give you two examples. We do have apayroll tax credit that has been offered to companies that bring on newunemployed workers into the workforce. I think we should continue that. I think we should continue to look at major spending oninfrastructure projects. You know, the good news here about thestimulus, it's said, well, the infrastructure projects haven't come onboard yet. They're coming on board now, and they have highjob-per-dollar-spent outcomes. AMANPOUR: All right. TYSON: And then, finally, we have to worry about the longer-runproblem of this structural employment, because I'm going to point outone thing for this discussion. The unemployment problem is primarily aproblem for people who have a high school -- who don't have a highschool education or just have a high school education. Unemployment for those with college educations is now 4.5 percent. Unemployment for those with more than a college education, below 4percent. We have a problem of education in this country, and we have toeducate more of our young people fully through college education. Let'stake this as an opportunity to do that. AMANPOUR: Let me ask Senator Corker on the Banking Committee -- andyou've spoken quite a lot about this -- you are in Chattanooga rightnow, and you told me that you have been out in the rural areas, wherethere's really nothing for people out there. You know, beyond -- beyond the current unemployment rate, there'salso underemployment, and it's standing at about 16.5 percent, the totalproblem of people who either don't have a job or who don't have enoughof a job to make ends meet. How is it -- is it impacting the people inthe rural areas? And do you think that this really goes to the heart ofthe American dream that is being deferred? CORKER: Well, you know, as we speak, the city that I'm sitting inhas been named one of the -- is named the top economic producer over thenext decade, and it's because of investment in the workforce. It's avision. It's the fact that we really have held on to trying to producethings. As you go to the rural areas, with the lack of infrastructure thatexists in most rural areas around our country, there's lesseropportunity for that. And so it does create challenges that don't existin some of the major metropolitan areas, and I think we're seeing thatmore and more across our country. At the same time, I think much of what we've done over this lastyear is create an air of unpredictability. And what's happening isbusinesses are sitting on the sideline. They don't know exactly whatthe lay of the land is. And I think the best thing we can do inWashington at this time is really just to calm down and quit changingsweeping -- making sweeping changes. I sat down with a business this week -- I'll give you an example --and they're looking at the health care bill, and they're trying todecide, should they keep people under 30 hours? Smaller businesses aresaying, should we stay under 25? So I think that much of what we've done over this last year hasactually been counterproductive. And, again, the best thing we can dois just calm down, to really let people's balance sheets sort of getback where they need to be. That will stimulate demand over time, asfamilies and people -- households across our country get their balancesheets in order. AMANPOUR: Well, we'll come back to that. You know, the FinancialTimes has basically said that Congress needs to, quote, ""get a grip."" I'm going to ask you about that right after I go to Governor Corzine andask him about what is going to stimulate the kind of consumer confidencethat you were just talking about, Senator -- Senator Corker. Look, there are figures, Governor Corzine, that suggest thatnon-financial companies have socked away something like $1.84 trillionin cash and other assets, but they're not spending them, they're nothiring, they're not building plants and other infrastructure. Why not? And wouldn't -- don't they have a responsibility to do so in this situation? CORZINE: Well, there is a gap of confidence in the economy thatcomes from the shock that we had of 2008 and 2009; $17 trillion worth oflost economic value in that timeframe makes companies and people very,very concerned. Even though we've had a major recovery in some of thatvaluation loss, it makes people nervous. We also -- and I think your quote that you started with actuallyframes what is the real problem. We have both a recession problem thatwas the result of the great financial crisis, but we also have thisgreat transformation that's taking place across the globe. A lot ofother countries are very competitive with the United States today, andwe need to invest in our education system, in our infrastructure system,in our efforts to expand our exports, if we're going to be competitiveas we go forward. AMANPOUR: OK, well, let me ask -- let me ask about that, becausewhen it comes to exports in manufacturing, we read quite a lot thatAmerica has been losing its competitive edge to places like China and --and -- and other such. Laura, what do you think the United States cando to regenerate a competitive export in manufacturing? TYSON: Well, I think the key word Jon raised is investment. And Ithink it is absolutely essential. You know, we get caught up indiscussions of deficit reduction or stimulus. Let's forget those issuesfor a minute and just think about investment. And here it is investment in a number of things. I've heard SenatorCorker talk about the importance of infrastructure. For years goinginto the Great Recession, it has been noted that the U.S. has beeninvesting inadequately in its infrastructure, maybe to the tune of $200billion a year of economically justifiable investment infrastructureswe're not doing. Let me turn to investment in education. It is the case -- we usedto be number one in the world in college graduation rates. We are nownumber 14, number 15. We're leading the world in high school dropoutrates. And as I said, the unemployment problem is most severe in dropouts. So invest in people. Invest in infrastructure. Invest inknowledge. You know, we basically are trying to get the research anddevelopment spending in this country up to 3 percent so we can again beleaders in the world in that. Invest, invest, invest is really what wemust do. Public-private partnerships, you know, with that, $100 billion ofthe stimulus package is levered to private spending. A dollar spent bythe public sector on infrastructure can bring three dollars of privatespending. AMANPOUR: So, Martin Regalia, why isn't the private sectorinvesting, investing, investing? REGALIA: Well, I think, you know, our tax laws and our otherregulatory structure in Washington don't foster that. We tax savingsmultiple times. We don't allow full cost recovery. We don't allowexpensing on investment. We can't even pass an R&D credit extensionthat's been delayed for over a year through a Congress that's fightingwith each other. And when you don't have the kind of laws and the kind of taxstructure that facilitate and encourage investment, you get a lot lessof it. We tax our multinational corporations on their overseas profit. We're the only major trading country in the OECD that still does that,that doesn't have a territorially tax system. And so what do we do? We tell our people, go out and export, andthen we tell them, we're going to tax you more than every other peopleyou have to compete with in the global economy. AMANPOUR: Senator Corker, what about that? We were talking aboutCongress, and you just heard Mr. Regalia talking about Congress fightingwith each other and not getting these things done. What do you thinkcan be done? You said chill out, calm down, perhaps until after theelection. What can be done to fix this, do you think, in a bipartisan way? CORKER: Well, I think one of the things we need to do -- I've heardLaura talking about investment -- is as a country, we need to decide,how much should the federal government spend? On average, it's been20.3 percent over the last 50 years. I heard Erskine Bowles the otherday say 21 percent. But I think much of our debate goes to littleissues that really divide our country, but that needs to be the firstissue. How much should the federal government take in from the privatesector? Once that decision is made -- I might say 18 percent. Erskine maysay 21 percent. Maybe the right number is someplace in between. Butafter that decision is made, what is the appropriate tax policy togenerate economic growth? And I think that some comments have been made about our lack of --the way we tax. We do tax investment. We encourage people to go intodebt. I think our tax policy in this country certainly needs to belooked at, and it needs to be looked at in a way to encourageinvestment, to encourage growth. Obviously, if our gross domestic product grows, then the whole issueof debt diminishes, the kind of things that Laura's talking about aremore able to be done. So I think we -- we need to move to that bigpicture first, look at what's appropriate. I think most people inAmerica would rather determine what to do with their own money versuslet 535 people decide for them. But the fact is that -- that we get mired down in these littleissues that divide us when really we ought to focus as a country on thisbigger issue first. AMANPOUR: So let me go to you, Governor Corzine. You lost anelection -- re-election in your state when you were governor. When youtook office, unemployment was at 4.7 percent. When you left, it was 9.9percent. Is that why you lost? And you've talked about how it waspainful, but in 20/20 hindsight, what could you have learnt from that,do you think? CORZINE: Well, I think that any time the economy is weak,incumbents are going to have challenging re-election on most instances,and that certainly was the case when you have unemployment rise thatmuch. We were in the midst of the financial meltdown and theaftershocks of that in 2009. I think we'll see some of that this fall. But I want to go back to, we have been successful in this country indriving investment with higher tax rates than what we have today. Ithink the issue about setting those and making sure that the expiringtax cuts that are actually on the table at the end of this year, thatneeds to get addressed, and it needs to get addressed relativelyquickly, because that does create uncertainty while that is yet to beresolved. I would hope that the Congress and the president would either say,""We're going to get to a conclusion about the long term,"" or, ""We'regoing to extend this for a year and we'll come back and debate this atanother point in time,"" because that's a major uncertainty overhangingthe economy. AMANPOUR: Let me... CORZINE: In the long run, though, we overemphasize taxes relativeto the general confidence and the well-being of our middle class. Thatcomes together, and you'll see it in the elections. If you have thathigh unemployment rate extending over a period of time, people are goingto be mighty unhappy, and they're going to take it out on both Democratsand Republicans. AMANPOUR: Let me just quickly go to what you've mentioned aboutbeing competitive with the rest of the world. The big story out ofEurope this weekend is that Germany has shown a stronger-than-expectedgrowth over the last quarter. Laura, you were saying something about how Germany had -- had taughtand trained its workforce to compete in these situations. TYSON: Right. Well, Germany has had a long-term commitment tomanufacturing. And it has a very strong manufacturing base. It has amuch larger share of its economy in manufacturing than we do. A major part of that is (inaudible) serious vocational training andvery serious ongoing training for manufacturing workers in Germany. Andoftentimes a German firm with German workers will retrain and usetechnology at home rather than offshore those jobs abroad. AMANPOUR: All right. TYSON: And I want to point out, also, that Germany manages to dothis with a much higher tax rate than we do. I think there should becorporate tax reform. I agree with what -- a lot of what Senator Corkerand Martin Regalia have said, but we need investment. And I would say, in thinking about the share of government and GDP,something that the senator mentioned, we need to distinguish betweeninvestment spending by the government -- whether it's federal, state orlocal -- and other spending. AMANPOUR: OK. TYSON: A dollar spent for infrastructure is different than a dollarspent for current operations of government. AMANPOUR: All right. We've got about 30 seconds left. I want toknow, do you think, Martin Regalia -- and then Senator Corker -- cansome confidence be injected into the American consumer anytime soon? REGALIA: Yes, I think it can. I think one thing that we have toaddress right away is, what's going to happen at the end of the yearwith the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts? There ought to be an extension, atleast a temporary extension, and that would help to -- to ease both theconsumers' fears and the business fears. AMANPOUR: Senator Corker, 15 seconds. CORKER: Yes, I agree with that. Let's -- let's leave tax policy asit is. Mark Zandi had a great piece today in the New York Times sayingthe same. Let's not fiddle any more. Let's leave it -- let's leavethings so they're predictable and deal with -- deal with this down the road. AMANPOUR: Well, we'll see how that plays out ahead of the electionsand afterwards. Thank you all for joining us on this important topic. CORKER: Thank you. AMANPOUR: And we turn now to Pakistan, a major U.S. ally, where amajor humanitarian crisis in its third week. Pakistan's government saysthe worst flooding in that nation's history has left 20 million peoplehomeless. U.S. military helicopters are providing a lifeline for manythere, but the U.N. says that 6 million people are in need of food,water and shelter. ABC's Jim Sciutto flew into Pakistan's Swat Valley with a U.S. Armyrelief mission. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)SCIUTTO (voice-over): From the air, the scale of the disaster isalarming, rivers swollen miles beyond their banks, behind them, a trailof destruction. (UNKNOWN): I've never seen such a large area receive as much damageas I have seen in Swat. SCIUTTO: Flying into the hard-hit Swat Valley aboard U.S. Armyrelief helicopters, we saw every single bridge destroyed, and on theground, villages now dependent on aid from the air. In Bahrain, population 40,000, its once waterfront hotels now in thewater. It has no power, no clean water, and no roads in or out. (on-screen): So it's cut on both sides? (UNKNOWN): Yes, it's gone on both sides. SCIUTTO: So this is -- this is an island now? (UNKNOWN): (OFF-MIKE) is an island. SCIUTTO: These American helicopters are ferrying supplies frombases like this one to villages that are completely cut off. We'reseeing rice and flour and other supplies going in. The helicopters aretoday their only lifeline. (voice-over): Food, much of it from the U.S., in, refugees out. For the fight crews diverted to relief from combat in Afghanistan, it isa dramatic shift. (UNKNOWN): I sat down and spoke to all the troops about turningthat switch off. But the first time I looked at those children needinghelp, I was no longer concerned. SCIUTTO: U.S. and Pakistani relief teams are fighting against theclock. This weekend, the first confirmed cases of cholera, apotentially deadly disease that's the result of the lack of cleandrinking water. For many Pakistanis, the flooding and its aftermath is a grittyreminder of all the ways the government has failed them, a ploddingresponse, a state budget dependent on fallen loans, shoddyinfrastructure. Seeking to take advantage of the chaos, the Taliban isdelivering help where the government is not, particularly in Swat, whichsaw the end of a massive anti-militant offensive just weeks ago. For the U.S., however, one sign of hope. America is deeplyunpopular here, but the relief effort is winning hearts and minds. Among them, the mayor of Bahrain, who told me the U.S. is outdoingPakistan's Muslim allies. (UNKNOWN): And in this disaster, the Islamic countries give theiraid after America. SCIUTTO (on-screen): Does that surprise you? (UNKNOWN): Yes, surprise, surprise. SCIUTTO: A good surprise? (UNKNOWN): Good surprise, yes. (END VIDEOTAPE)SCIUTTO: The first priority of the American relief effort is tohelp the millions in need, but U.S. officials will say very openly it'salso intended to improve America's dismal image here. Sixty-eightpercent of Pakistanis view the U.S. negatively, and the sight of thoseAmerican helicopters a very tangible form of outreach. And, Christiane, on a lot of that food going in, we've seen themlabeled very prominently with American flags. AMANPOUR: Jim, indeed. Let's just talk a little bit more aboutthat, because you mentioned the disapproval rate because of the dronestrikes, because of going after terrorists that kill quite a lot ofcivilians. How are you noticing that in these areas Americans areactually being received warmly because of this aid? SCIUTTO: Well, we see them getting hugged. They're getting kissesliterally on the ground from these troops and thanks, gratitude for thisaid that they're in desperate need of. That said, nationally, the Pakistani media is not covering the U.S. relief effort very closely. They're focusing -- perhaps notsurprisingly -- on the Pakistani relief effort. And in a sign of thesensitivity of simply being associated with the U.S., the U.S. will notidentify local Pakistani NGOs that it's giving aid to so it doesn't openup the risk that they're subject -- that they're targeted for terrorattacks. AMANPOUR: And, Jim, very quickly, the Pakistani troops, are theybeing diverted from fighting the militants? SCIUTTO: Well, there are 50,000 Pakistani troops involved in thisrelief effort. Pakistani officials say that none of them have beendiverted from the border or from counterterror operations. And U.S. officials that we've spoken to today say they believe thosereassurances. And they say, Christiane, that counterterror operationswith the Pakistanis are underway as we speak. AMANPOUR: Jim, thanks so much, from Islamabad. And in response to my questions on the disaster, you can seecomments from U.S. Special Representative to Afghanistan and PakistanRichard Holbrooke on our Web site at abcnews.com/thisweek. And coming up next, the president's decision to weigh in on thecontroversial Islamic center near Ground Zero on our roundtable withCokie Roberts, Matthew Dowd, David Ignatius, and Chrystia Freeland. ENDABC News ""This Week with Christiane Amanpour""Roundtable: Cokie Roberts, Matthew Dowd, David Ignatius, Chrystia FreelandSunday August 15 2010 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(UNKNOWN): How is that healing, by building a mosque, anin-your-face mosque at Ground Zero? (UNKNOWN): It's like spraying swastikas all over a Jewish memorial. BLOOMBERG: We would be untrue to the best part of ourselves and whowe are as New Yorkers and Americans if we said no to a mosque in lowerManhattan. KING: This is such a sensitive issue. This, to me, is such a wrongplace to have a mosque such as this. OBAMA: I believe that Muslims have the right to practice theirreligion, as everyone else in this country. That includes the right tobuild a place of worship and a community center on private property inlower Manhattan in accordance with local laws and ordinances. (END VIDEO CLIP)AMANPOUR: The president waded into the controversy over the Islamiccenter near Ground Zero, one of the topics that we'll be discussing thismorning in our roundtable, with political strategist Matthew Dowd,Chrystia Freeland of Thomson Reuters, David Ignatius of the WashingtonPost, and our own Cokie Roberts. George Will is still on vacation. Thank you all for joining us. You did see that speech by thepresident on Friday night at the Iftar Ramadan dinner at the WhiteHouse. Why do you think he said that then? ROBERTS: I think he said that then because he actually believesthat, but the real question is, why that he didn't say the next daysomething more? Do you want to talk about that? AMANPOUR: Yes, we do, because we're going to put up some pollnumbers and just show everybody what the poll numbers are on thisissue. One poll says, when they ask about what people think about theplan to build the mosque, that only 30 percent say it's appropriate and64 percent say it's wrong, but when they say do the Muslim group have aright to build the mosque, 61 percent say yes and 34 percent say no. So I guess, is that, do you think, what caused the backtracking? Although those poll numbers were out before the speech on Friday night. Listen to what the president said in the gulf in Florida on Saturday,yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: I was not commenting and I will not comment on the wisdom ofmaking a decision to put a mosque there. I was commenting veryspecifically on the right that people have that dates back to ourfounding. That's what our country is about. (END VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS: That's really not what he was doing. I mean, if youlisten -- as you played the whole first part of what he said -- he saidthey have a right to build on private property, all of that, and --granted, he didn't say it's wise to build on private property, but itwas very clearly an endorsement. And then to walk back from it is justso silly. He's already taken all the flack for having said it. DOWD: I think they figured out this is a real political problemthey have. And I think they either had a tin ear at the beginning ofthis and how it was going to come across or they mishandled it totallyfrom the beginning, because if they understood, I think, the public onthis, where two-thirds of the public say they have a right buttwo-thirds of the public say don't do it, he would have given a speechgoing directly to those points, instead of saying -- one day saying theyhave the right and the next day saying I didn't necessarily say it wasthe right thing to do. I think this is a big problem for the president, because it feeds abroader narrative about him, which is, it's my way or the highway. Inmany ways, to me, it reminds me of Bush, which is, is, ""I don't carewhere the American public is on this. I'm going to say what I think isthe right thing to do."" He did on -- he's done it on immigration in Arizona. He's done iton this. He's done it on health care. I think that's the politicalproblem... (CROSSTALK)IGNATIUS: ... problem for him. I thought that the speech Fridaynight was a model of political courage, in the sense that he said whathe believed knowing that it was going to cost him. The White House hasstayed out of this issue knowing that it's political poison, and I thinkthe president spoke to it fairly directly. This is America. Peoplehave a right to build on property that they own, even if it's going tobe a mosque near Ground Zero. He said -- I was sort of sorry that he was trying to walk it back inthese more nuanced comments yesterday. FREELAND: I totally agree with David. And I think, you know, Matt,too, the point of my way or the highway, another way of talking aboutthat is leadership, conviction, having your beliefs, and not governingaccording to polls. And I think if you asked most Americans, what kind of a leader doyou want, if you ask people in the world what kind of a leader, you wantsomeone who governs according to conviction. And I do think this touches on, Christiane, the economic panel thatyou had earlier. I think that it touches on it in two important ways. This point about private property might seem like a parsing, but it isactually essential. And I think to have the president -- and we had similar commentsfrom Mike Bloomberg coming out and saying, actually, we believe that therights of private property are so strong, we are not going to changethem because -- because... (CROSSTALK)AMANPOUR: But there are two issues, Cokie. Where does this go fromnow? I mean, where does it actually go? Is this now a line drawn underit? ROBERTS: No. AMANPOUR: Is this... ROBERTS: No, I think that... (CROSSTALK)AMANPOUR: ... to get built? ROBERTS: Well, that's -- that's an issue that I certainly can'tanswer, but I -- my guess is, eventually it does get built and that itbecomes no problem. But the -- but the political issue will continue, because eventhough the president's remarks Friday night started a firestorm, I thinkthe backtracking is even worse, because, you know, you can make a casethat what he said Friday night is just a matter of fact, it is anAmerican right, but to keep -- to keep saying, well, now I'm not sureabout this, and then what tomorrow is like... (CROSSTALK)AMANPOUR: ... I just want to ask you, because it does go to theheart of what he's been doing since the beginning of his presidency,reaching out to the -- not just the Muslim world, but to Muslims ingeneral. And he made a very important first interview, where he saidthe United States could not afford to have yet another generation ofMuslims viewing it as the enemy. So do you think it's wise to have this huge hubbub over it or itshould just go forward, this mosque? DOWD: Well, he would -- the president would like this to sort ofjust go away and not have a huge hubbub about this. The problem is, isthat two-thirds of the country are opposed to him on this. That's aproblem for a president of the United States. I think he is in totally -- he states what's in the Constitution. They have a right to build it. That's not the point in this. That isnot the point in this. You have a right for free speech. It doesn'tmean that you can go and like yell... (CROSSTALK)IGNATIUS: Standing up for free speech for Muslims is -- is a pointin this climate. FREELAND: Where is that not the point? DOWD: But it -- it -- the point is, is that you have to buildconsensus on this. Tolerance goes two ways. Tolerance goes two ways. Tolerance is the tolerance to somebody to build on private property whatthey want, but tolerance also is to recognize what that symbolicallysays to a whole bunch of people in this country. And if you don'trecognize that, you're going to have this kind of furor. AMANPOUR: Do you think it should go ahead? DOWD: Do I think it should go ahead? No. I think he should calltogether the people -- there's many Muslims and many people in the Arabcommunity that are very worried about this happening, actually, thatthey voiced in there. I think he or somebody should call together something, put this onhold for a little while, bring together some consensus about what peopleshould do, because right now, it's white hot. AMANPOUR: But what do you do then? It is white hot -- you'reabsolutely right -- right now. But what do you do when the actualowners, the people who want to build this are in the moderate stream ofMuslims, did go to the White House? You were there when they did, when-- when this gentleman did, condemned 9/11, condemned extremism,condemned terrorism, and now they're faced with this situation? ROBERTS: Well, there are -- there are ways always of making thesesituations just less hot. And it is a question of suggesting otherplaces, providing other places. Those kinds of things can always beworked out. FREELAND: But let's talk a little bit about the rest of the world. You know, I think that actually the president's comments, the commentsby Mike Bloomberg are a really important message to the Muslim world. And we're going to be talking about Pakistan later on. For thesepeople, for American leaders to say, in the space of, you know, somepolitical pressure from their voters, to say, actually, we believesufficiently strongly in diversity, in private property rights for ourAmerican citizens, I think that's a great... (CROSSTALK)IGNATIUS: ... our strongest -- our strongest suits. ROBERTS: ... coming back from it is the problem. IGNATIUS: As the world looks at us, if they see that the UnitedStates -- even in -- you know, an issue that hurts -- and Ground Zerohurts -- even on that issue, we still stand up for the freedom of peopleto dispose of their property as they want, that does count. When I travel, you travel, Christiane, you know, we hear commentsabout that America a lot. And I think you shouldn't minimize thebenefits of -- of saying to moderate Muslims, ""Here you are. Thisupsets a lot of Americans, but we're""... (CROSSTALK)FREELAND: ... if the people you're being tolerant of... (CROSSTALK)DOWD: There's two freedoms in conflict here. There's two freedomsin conflict. There's the freedom to build on your private property andthen the freedom for people to protest and say this is not what we want. IGNATIUS: Understood. DOWD: I think the president obviously has to lead in this countryand lead in the world. The problem with this one is he is speaking froma position of weakness, not a position of strength. And so if he doesnot have consensus... AMANPOUR: Why do you say that? DOWD: He is in a total position -- his approval numbers in thiscountry are in the low 40s. He's perceived as not able to handle allthe major issues in this country right now. The vast majority of thiscountry right now questions his leadership. For him to go out on an issue like this that is white hot and thensay, ""I'm going to say it, and I'm going to lead the rest of the world,""while two-thirds of this country is in another place, is a real problemfor him. AMANPOUR: So, clearly, the consensus appears that it should havebeen arranged, debated, done in a slightly better way between those whowanted to actually build it and the community, whether they're Jewishmembers of the community, Christians, or other Muslims. And one of the tragedies seems to me that the actual imam wastalking -- and his wife -- to the -- to the people who put up the Jewishcommunity center in New York and was talking about how to have somethingsimilar like that. And it seems to have all gone awry. Let's move on to politics, because this week was also -- and this is(inaudible) was primary week in -- in -- in many states. Some have saida group of sort of -- political playbook said oddball character iscoming out of right field. What -- whether you believe or agree withthat or not -- do you think is the effect of those who've won in someareas, the Tea Party candidates, those who supported? DOWD: Well, it's interesting. ABC, I think over the last couple ofmonths, has done a great job of sort of gauging the frustration thatexists in this country, and it's high as it was in 1992, as high as it'sbeen in 2008. It's not just limited to Republicans. It's independentsand some Democrats in this. I think these primaries have shown that there are some places whereit's real anger that's related to frustration and then it's other placeswhich a majority (ph) which is related to frustration. I think the Republican Party right now, it is the comparison betweena bonfire there and a campfire in the Democratic primary. So you canhandle the campfire, but the bonfire, which is what helped elect TeaParty people and what's gone on across just headed into November. I think this is perilous for both parties, actually. I think it'sperilous for the Republicans if they become the Tea Party folks, whichare sort of out of the mainstream and are going to have a hard timewinning November elections, but it's also perilous, I think, for theDemocrats if they ignore this level of frustration and they don't dealwith it. ROBERTS: That's right. They -- now, they've had plenty of time tolearn about it, and they've had town meetings and heard about it and allthat, so they're not going to be taken by surprise. But they think thatthey can just go back to the old playbook, so they're pulling out SocialSecurity, and they're running against George Bush, and they're doingthings that have worked for them in the past that I'm not at all surewill work for them this year, and that could be a real problem, becausethey're not understanding the level of frustration. IGNATIUS: The Democrats sound this year with this president likethe party of the establishment. And we have a political firestorm outin the country. People are really angry. They're angry at Washington. They're angry about the economy. The Tea Party is an expression ofthat, but what Robert Gibbs, the president's press secretary, wascalling the professional left is another example of that, people whojust are angry at the mainstream, centrist views the president often hasbeen espousing. And I think that's a real problem for them. They don't have theenergy. They're not tapping into this energy source as they headtowards the elections. FREELAND: Well, doesn't it just all come down to the economy? ROBERTS: Well, sure. Sure. FREELAND: I mean, you know, I don't want to be too simplistic, butwith unemployment at nearly 10 percent, I thought the comments that JonCorzine made earlier were right on, that this is a double whammy, thisis a recession following a financial crisis, and this is also the finalact of America's structural adjustment to globalization and thetechnology revolution. That's a really big deal. And I think the real problem is not --you know, we're going to be focused a lot on messaging and cosmeticsahead of the midterms. The real question is, can an American politicalparty or political movement come up with a powerful economic plan, andone that is maybe really different? And we're seeing that happen in other countries. Look at Britain. David Cameron's Tories won with a really radical plan, and they gotactually... (CROSSTALK)IGNATIUS: ... just doesn't work. I mean, it's not like they didn'thave a plan. DOWD: Republicans don't really have to come up with anything overthe next 90 days. ROBERTS: No, that's right. DOWD: They're going to win a huge amount of seats in the House, ahuge amount of seats in the Senate. They're going to win a bunch ofgovernors' races. To me, the economy is representative of a bigger issue that's outthere. I agree the economy is the number-one issue. The problem is, ispeople out there do not think Washington is listening to them. Theydon't think they're paying attention to what's going on in America. And the reason why the economy is so -- has so much anger in it isbecause people don't think they're being empathetic with where they arein their life. And that's, I think, a problem. ROBERTS: But they're also -- you know, the voters were also veryambivalent themselves, because on the one hand, the furious... (CROSSTALK)ROBERTS: Right, exactly. They're furious with Washington for beingfurious and for everybody fighting with each other and why doesn'tanything work, and yet they're furious and feed into that partisanshiptremendously so that there's no right answer for the politicians as theygo to face the voters. AMANPOUR: But also these primaries this week, the White House andDemocrats were saying that it's not such a bad bag. We (inaudible)comfort from some of the results there. ROBERTS: Well, because they were able to re-nominate Michael Bennetin Colorado, and that made them feel good, because they had backed him. But, you know, Newt Gingrich had backed Nathan Deal in Georgia, too, andhe won against Sarah Palin's candidate. So, you know... (CROSSTALK)AMANPOUR: What does that say about the sort of star of the TeaParty movement? DOWD: Well, I mean, endorsements always to me are questionableanyway, because the voters ultimately make the decision. I think stillSarah Palin -- Sarah Palin on the Republican side has the most energyand emotion and passion behind her than any other candidate. She canstill walk into a city and get 3,000, 5,000 people. No one can dothat. So she can have that emotionally. She can charge that, andultimately it's about her. I think the interesting thing on the results is that, there's thisbig wave coming into Washington, and Democrats have a seawall. Andwhat's happened now is Republicans have nominated people that may not beable to win. And so basically the Republicans are putting bricks on topof the seawall and building it higher, that they're going to have lesschance of winning in this election because of who they've nominated insome of these places. IGNATIUS: You know, their biggest problem would be... ROBERTS: Working on that seawall. IGNATIUS: ... I suspect, if they -- if they did win. Suppose theRepublicans did win control of the House and the Senate. What wouldthey do? What would their program be? You know, they'd be a mucheasier mark for the Democrats heading toward the 2012 presidentialelection. You almost think it would be better for Obama... (CROSSTALK)ROBERTS: Well, of course it would be better for Obama. FREELAND: You can try to triangulate... (CROSSTALK)DOWD: ... 2012 if the Republicans took one of the branches, becausethey could either do one of two things which would be beneficial tohim. He could compromise and then show him, he's going to buildbridges, or he could just say, ""They're the problem, they're the problem."" The fear I think the White House has is he's going to get the worstpossible result, which is a small margin in the House, a small margin inthe Senate, he can't get anything done, but he owns all the levers ofgovernment... (CROSSTALK)AMANPOUR: So now that we've settled that one, let's move right outof the country to Pakistan briefly, because we did talk about it withJim Sciutto, but it's been likened to their Katrina. The U.S. is doingthe right thing sending relief, right? ROBERTS: Yes, sure. DOWD: Yes, absolutely. AMANPOUR: Politically, economically. ROBERTS: Absolutely. AMANPOUR: How... ROBERTS: Humanitarian. AMANPOUR: Humanitarian, of course... FREELAND: Strategically. AMANPOUR: Exactly. What do you think, though, when you look atthis, here's the fight, here's Pakistan nuclear-armed, here's Pakistanhaving done the right thing, to an extent, having sent its army afterthe militants, and all of that, all of that just about being washed awayliterally. IGNATIUS: Here -- Christiane, here's a country on the edge, acountry that's $11 billion in debt to the IMF, barely staggering along,that's fighting an insurgency at home, and all of a sudden, pow, it getshit with this terrible flood. The latest Pakistani estimate is thatthere are 20 million people who are affected in the country. And the question that people are beginning to raise is, is the floodgoing to be the final additional thing that pushes Pakistan into being afailed state? The army is going to have to focus on rebuilding roads,getting food to people -- I mean the Pakistani army here, hopefully withhelp from the U.S. military -- but that means they won't be able tofight the Taliban. I was expecting that there would be an offensive in North Waziristanagainst the Taliban and Al Qaida this fall. I was even going to go look-- go travel with the Pakistani troops. I have a feeling now themilitary will be too busy, and that's just one sign... (CROSSTALK)ROBERTS: Maybe it doesn't matter, though. Maybe -- maybe the factis -- I mean, this is -- this is wishful thinking -- but maybe the factis, is having all of this aid come in from the West -- and particularlyfrom the United States -- and it is our military... DOWD: Almost solely from the United States. ROBERTS: ... also -- right, and it's -- and it's not just ourmilitary. It's USAID and all of our humanitarian organizations. I workwith Save the Children there, and we've been in Pakistan for 30 yearsand doing this kind of work. Seeing that is more important than sayingwe can build a mosque in Manhattan, in terms of dealing with the Muslimworld. FREELAND: Well, that presupposes that the aid is effective. And Ithink to David's point, the other danger -- it's not just that thePakistani army is not in a position now to go on the offensive againstthe Taliban. I think the real danger here is that you find the localIslamic organizations, extremist Islamic organizations turning out to bemore effective at helping... (CROSSTALK)IGNATIUS: ... a lot of people angry... (CROSSTALK)FREELAND: I think that -- I think that... (CROSSTALK)FREELAND: ... why Western support, particularly U.S. support, is soimportant right now. You know, U.S. policy has to try hard to make thePakistanis feel it is not purely a utilitarian relationship, it's notjust transactional, that America cares about Pakistan, not just becauseof its relationship with Afghanistan and the Taliban. (UNKNOWN): Well, the only reason why we're in Pakistan is becauseit is transactional. FREELAND: Yes, so -- so... (UNKNOWN): And it's vital. (CROSSTALK)(UNKNOWN): ... it's vital to our interests and to the interests ofthe world. (CROSSTALK)FREELAND: ... works, because Pakistani... (CROSSTALK)AMANPOUR: And we barely have any time left, but 30 seconds to talkabout Russia about to put the nuclear fuel into the Bushehr plant insouthern Iran. IGNATIUS: If you wanted one more piece of bad news this week forthe Obama administration, it would be that Russia, which has really beenvery cooperative on Iran, which has joined us in U.N. sanctions thathave been tougher than people expected, has decided that it's going toship -- next week it's going to begin to operationalize a nuclearreactor in Iran, a civilian nuclear reactor that generates power. And,you know, that's the last thing this administration would have wanted. AMANPOUR: On that note -- on that note, the roundtable continues inthe green room at abcnews.com/thisweek, where you can also find our factchecks, in conjunction with PolitiFact. Also on our Web site now, dramatic images from Russia this week,where wildfires have ravaged that country. Choking smoke from the firesand record high temperatures have led to hundreds of deaths in Moscow,and the drought has destroyed a quarter of Russia's grain crops. It'snow banned exports, causing price spikes, and raising concerns of aglobal food crisis in the fall. AMANPOUR (voice-over): Good morning. I'm Christiane Amanpour. Andat the top of the news this week, trouble on the road to recovery. Jobless claims are up. (UNKNOWN): The numbers are dismal for employment. AMANPOUR: And Wall Street gets nervous. How worried should we be? And what will bring confidence back? This morning, top voices on theeconomy: former New Jersey Governor and Wall Street CEO Jon Corzine;Republican Senator Bob Corker of the Senate Banking Committee; Obamaeconomic adviser Laura Tyson; and chief economist at the U.S. Then, washed away. Twenty million Pakistanis in danger, as theworst flooding in memory leaves huge areas of the country under water. It's a race against time to bring relief. ""This Week"" has the latestfrom inside the crisis, with U.S. efforts to deliver aid. Plus this week, the president weighs in, defending the mosque andIslamic center near Ground Zero. OBAMA: Muslims have a right to practice their religion, as everyoneelse in this country. AMANPOUR: Or does he? AMANPOUR: That and all the week's news and politics on ourroundtable, with Cokie Roberts, political strategist Matthew Dowd, DavidIgnatius of the Washington Post, and Chrystia Freeland of Thomson Reuters. And the Sunday funnies. LENO: Unemployment among teenagers at an all-time high, all aroundthe world. It's not just here. In fact, in China, it is so bad, kidsas old as seven are having to move back in with their parents. ANNOUNCER: From all across our world to the heart of our nation'scapital, ABC ""This Week"" with Christiane Amanpour starts now. AMANPOUR: Good morning. This was supposed to be the summer ofrecovery, but the effects of the so-called Great Recession continue tocloud this nation and much of the world. The number of U.S. workersseeking unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly to 484,000. It's theworst in almost six months. And in the housing sector, banks foreclosedon more than 90,000 properties in July, the second-highest total sincethe crisis began. And these pictures speak to the desperation this week in Atlanta. Thirty thousand people waited for hours in sweltering heat to apply for655 available spots of government-subsidized housing. And I'm joined by four top voices on the economy. From Berkeley,California, member of the president's Economic Recovery Advisory BoardLaura Tyson. From Chattanooga, Tennessee, Republican Senator Bob Corkerof the Banking Committee. In New York, the former New Jersey governorand CEO of MF Global, Jon Corzine. And joining us here in Washington,chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Martin Regalia. Thank you all for joining me. You've heard the figures. You'veread about the figures. You can also probably palpably feel the concernand worry amongst the American people. And I want to read you somethingthat was written about this joblessness, about the younger generation inthe Atlantic recently. Look at what was written about unemployment. ""There is unemployment -- a brief and relatively routinetransitional state that results from the rise and fall of companies inany economy, and there is unemployment -- chronic, all-consuming. Theformer is a necessary lubricant in any engine of economic growth. Thelatter is a pestilence that slowly eats away at people, families, and,if it spreads widely enough, the fabric of society. Indeed, historysuggests that this is perhaps society's most noxious ill."" Let me turn to you right now, Martin Regalia. Do you agree withthat? And do you think that that's what this country is in right now? REGALIA: Well, I agree with it, and I think that is what we'reseeing right now. We're seeing an economy that is growing, but growingin a very lackluster way. It's not generating enough demand, andtherefore it's not generating enough jobs. And on top of that, the last three or four recessions have givenrise to longer terms of unemployment. More retooling is necessary tobring the displaced workers back into the workforce, and that retoolingis taking a lot longer. AMANPOUR: Let me turn to you, Laura Tyson. You're an adviser tothe president right now. A recent Wall Street Journal poll of some 53economists say they don't see the employment rate coming down below 9percent, you know, at least until June 2011. What can be done about this? TYSON: Well, I think that we have to do a number of things. Ithink we have to worry, first of all, about taking care of the peoplewho are unemployed. And that's why I really have supported theextension of unemployment benefits and the extension of benefits to helppeople maintain their health insurance if they lose their job, very,very important. You have to deal with the reality that people arelong-term unemployed, 7 million people long-term unemployed. Secondly, we have to continue to do everything we can to stimulatedemand in the economy. Let me give you two examples. We do have apayroll tax credit that has been offered to companies that bring on newunemployed workers into the workforce. I think we should continue that. I think we should continue to look at major spending oninfrastructure projects. You know, the good news here about thestimulus, it's said, well, the infrastructure projects haven't come onboard yet. They're coming on board now, and they have highjob-per-dollar-spent outcomes. TYSON: And then, finally, we have to worry about the longer-runproblem of this structural employment, because I'm going to point outone thing for this discussion. The unemployment problem is primarily aproblem for people who have a high school -- who don't have a highschool education or just have a high school education. Unemployment for those with college educations is now 4.5 percent. Unemployment for those with more than a college education, below 4percent. We have a problem of education in this country, and we have toeducate more of our young people fully through college education. Let'stake this as an opportunity to do that. AMANPOUR: Let me ask Senator Corker on the Banking Committee -- andyou've spoken quite a lot about this -- you are in Chattanooga rightnow, and you told me that you have been out in the rural areas, wherethere's really nothing for people out there. You know, beyond -- beyond the current unemployment rate, there'salso underemployment, and it's standing at about 16.5 percent, the totalproblem of people who either don't have a job or who don't have enoughof a job to make ends meet. How is it -- is it impacting the people inthe rural areas? And do you think that this really goes to the heart ofthe American dream that is being deferred? CORKER: Well, you know, as we speak, the city that I'm sitting inhas been named one of the -- is named the top economic producer over thenext decade, and it's because of investment in the workforce. It's avision. It's the fact that we really have held on to trying to producethings. As you go to the rural areas, with the lack of infrastructure thatexists in most rural areas around our country, there's lesseropportunity for that. And so it does create challenges that don't existin some of the major metropolitan areas, and I think we're seeing thatmore and more across our country. At the same time, I think much of what we've done over this lastyear is create an air of unpredictability. And what's happening isbusinesses are sitting on the sideline. They don't know exactly whatthe lay of the land is. And I think the best thing we can do inWashington at this time is really just to calm down and quit changingsweeping -- making sweeping changes. I sat down with a business this week -- I'll give you an example --and they're looking at the health care bill, and they're trying todecide, should they keep people under 30 hours? Smaller businesses aresaying, should we stay under 25? So I think that much of what we've done over this last year hasactually been counterproductive. And, again, the best thing we can dois just calm down, to really let people's balance sheets sort of getback where they need to be. That will stimulate demand over time, asfamilies and people -- households across our country get their balancesheets in order. AMANPOUR: Well, we'll come back to that. You know, the FinancialTimes has basically said that Congress needs to, quote, ""get a grip."" I'm going to ask you about that right after I go to Governor Corzine andask him about what is going to stimulate the kind of consumer confidencethat you were just talking about, Senator -- Senator Corker. Look, there are figures, Governor Corzine, that suggest thatnon-financial companies have socked away something like $1.84 trillionin cash and other assets, but they're not spending them, they're nothiring, they're not building plants and other infrastructure. Why not? And wouldn't -- don't they have a responsibility to do so in this situation? CORZINE: Well, there is a gap of confidence in the economy thatcomes from the shock that we had of 2008 and 2009; $17 trillion worth oflost economic value in that timeframe makes companies and people very,very concerned. Even though we've had a major recovery in some of thatvaluation loss, it makes people nervous. We also -- and I think your quote that you started with actuallyframes what is the real problem. We have both a recession problem thatwas the result of the great financial crisis, but we also have thisgreat transformation that's taking place across the globe. A lot ofother countries are very competitive with the United States today, andwe need to invest in our education system, in our infrastructure system,in our efforts to expand our exports, if we're going to be competitiveas we go forward. AMANPOUR: OK, well, let me ask -- let me ask about that, becausewhen it comes to exports in manufacturing, we read quite a lot thatAmerica has been losing its competitive edge to places like China and --and -- and other such. Laura, what do you think the United States cando to regenerate a competitive export in manufacturing? TYSON: Well, I think the key word Jon raised is investment. And Ithink it is absolutely essential. You know, we get caught up indiscussions of deficit reduction or stimulus. Let's forget those issuesfor a minute and just think about investment. And here it is investment in a number of things. I've heard SenatorCorker talk about the importance of infrastructure. For years goinginto the Great Recession, it has been noted that the U.S. has beeninvesting inadequately in its infrastructure, maybe to the tune of $200billion a year of economically justifiable investment infrastructureswe're not doing. Let me turn to investment in education. It is the case -- we usedto be number one in the world in college graduation rates. We are nownumber 14, number 15. We're leading the world in high school dropoutrates. And as I said, the unemployment problem is most severe in dropouts. So invest in people. Invest in infrastructure. Invest inknowledge. You know, we basically are trying to get the research anddevelopment spending in this country up to 3 percent so we can again beleaders in the world in that. Invest, invest, invest is really what wemust do. Public-private partnerships, you know, with that, $100 billion ofthe stimulus package is levered to private spending. A dollar spent bythe public sector on infrastructure can bring three dollars of privatespending. AMANPOUR: So, Martin Regalia, why isn't the private sectorinvesting, investing, investing? REGALIA: Well, I think, you know, our tax laws and our otherregulatory structure in Washington don't foster that. We tax savingsmultiple times. We don't allow full cost recovery. We don't allowexpensing on investment. We can't even pass an R&D credit extensionthat's been delayed for over a year through a Congress that's fightingwith each other. And when you don't have the kind of laws and the kind of taxstructure that facilitate and encourage investment, you get a lot lessof it. We tax our multinational corporations on their overseas profit. We're the only major trading country in the OECD that still does that,that doesn't have a territorially tax system. And so what do we do? We tell our people, go out and export, andthen we tell them, we're going to tax you more than every other peopleyou have to compete with in the global economy. AMANPOUR: Senator Corker, what about that? We were talking aboutCongress, and you just heard Mr. Regalia talking about Congress fightingwith each other and not getting these things done. What do you thinkcan be done? You said chill out, calm down, perhaps until after theelection. What can be done to fix this, do you think, in a bipartisan way? CORKER: Well, I think one of the things we need to do -- I've heardLaura talking about investment -- is as a country, we need to decide,how much should the federal government spend? On average, it's been20.3 percent over the last 50 years. I heard Erskine Bowles the otherday say 21 percent. But I think much of our debate goes to littleissues that really divide our country, but that needs to be the firstissue. How much should the federal government take in from the privatesector? Once that decision is made -- I might say 18 percent. Erskine maysay 21 percent. Maybe the right number is someplace in between. Butafter that decision is made, what is the appropriate tax policy togenerate economic growth? And I think that some comments have been made about our lack of --the way we tax. We do tax investment. We encourage people to go intodebt. I think our tax policy in this country certainly needs to belooked at, and it needs to be looked at in a way to encourageinvestment, to encourage growth. Obviously, if our gross domestic product grows, then the whole issueof debt diminishes, the kind of things that Laura's talking about aremore able to be done. So I think we -- we need to move to that bigpicture first, look at what's appropriate. I think most people inAmerica would rather determine what to do with their own money versuslet 535 people decide for them. But the fact is that -- that we get mired down in these littleissues that divide us when really we ought to focus as a country on thisbigger issue first. AMANPOUR: So let me go to you, Governor Corzine. You lost anelection -- re-election in your state when you were governor. When youtook office, unemployment was at 4.7 percent. When you left, it was 9.9percent. Is that why you lost? And you've talked about how it waspainful, but in 20/20 hindsight, what could you have learnt from that,do you think? CORZINE: Well, I think that any time the economy is weak,incumbents are going to have challenging re-election on most instances,and that certainly was the case when you have unemployment rise thatmuch. We were in the midst of the financial meltdown and theaftershocks of that in 2009. I think we'll see some of that this fall. But I want to go back to, we have been successful in this country indriving investment with higher tax rates than what we have today. Ithink the issue about setting those and making sure that the expiringtax cuts that are actually on the table at the end of this year, thatneeds to get addressed, and it needs to get addressed relativelyquickly, because that does create uncertainty while that is yet to beresolved. I would hope that the Congress and the president would either say,""We're going to get to a conclusion about the long term,"" or, ""We'regoing to extend this for a year and we'll come back and debate this atanother point in time,"" because that's a major uncertainty overhangingthe economy. CORZINE: In the long run, though, we overemphasize taxes relativeto the general confidence and the well-being of our middle class. Thatcomes together, and you'll see it in the elections. If you have thathigh unemployment rate extending over a period of time, people are goingto be mighty unhappy, and they're going to take it out on both Democratsand Republicans. AMANPOUR: Let me just quickly go to what you've mentioned aboutbeing competitive with the rest of the world. The big story out ofEurope this weekend is that Germany has shown a stronger-than-expectedgrowth over the last quarter. Laura, you were saying something about how Germany had -- had taughtand trained its workforce to compete in these situations. TYSON: Right. Well, Germany has had a long-term commitment tomanufacturing. And it has a very strong manufacturing base. It has amuch larger share of its economy in manufacturing than we do. A major part of that is (inaudible) serious vocational training andvery serious ongoing training for manufacturing workers in Germany. Andoftentimes a German firm with German workers will retrain and usetechnology at home rather than offshore those jobs abroad. TYSON: And I want to point out, also, that Germany manages to dothis with a much higher tax rate than we do. I think there should becorporate tax reform. I agree with what -- a lot of what Senator Corkerand Martin Regalia have said, but we need investment. And I would say, in thinking about the share of government and GDP,something that the senator mentioned, we need to distinguish betweeninvestment spending by the government -- whether it's federal, state orlocal -- and other spending. TYSON: A dollar spent for infrastructure is different than a dollarspent for current operations of government. AMANPOUR: All right. We've got about 30 seconds left. I want toknow, do you think, Martin Regalia -- and then Senator Corker -- cansome confidence be injected into the American consumer anytime soon? REGALIA: Yes, I think it can. I think one thing that we have toaddress right away is, what's going to happen at the end of the yearwith the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts? There ought to be an extension, atleast a temporary extension, and that would help to -- to ease both theconsumers' fears and the business fears. AMANPOUR: Senator Corker, 15 seconds. CORKER: Yes, I agree with that. Let's -- let's leave tax policy asit is. Mark Zandi had a great piece today in the New York Times sayingthe same. Let's not fiddle any more. Let's leave it -- let's leavethings so they're predictable and deal with -- deal with this down the road. AMANPOUR: Well, we'll see how that plays out ahead of the electionsand afterwards. Thank you all for joining us on this important topic. AMANPOUR: And we turn now to Pakistan, a major U.S. ally, where amajor humanitarian crisis in its third week. Pakistan's government saysthe worst flooding in that nation's history has left 20 million peoplehomeless. U.S. military helicopters are providing a lifeline for manythere, but the U.N. says that 6 million people are in need of food,water and shelter. ABC's Jim Sciutto flew into Pakistan's Swat Valley with a U.S. Armyrelief mission. SCIUTTO (voice-over): From the air, the scale of the disaster isalarming, rivers swollen miles beyond their banks, behind them, a trailof destruction. (UNKNOWN): I've never seen such a large area receive as much damageas I have seen in Swat. SCIUTTO: Flying into the hard-hit Swat Valley aboard U.S. Armyrelief helicopters, we saw every single bridge destroyed, and on theground, villages now dependent on aid from the air. In Bahrain, population 40,000, its once waterfront hotels now in thewater. It has no power, no clean water, and no roads in or out. (on-screen): So it's cut on both sides? (UNKNOWN): Yes, it's gone on both sides. SCIUTTO: So this is -- this is an island now? (UNKNOWN): (OFF-MIKE) is an island. SCIUTTO: These American helicopters are ferrying supplies frombases like this one to villages that are completely cut off. We'reseeing rice and flour and other supplies going in. The helicopters aretoday their only lifeline. (voice-over): Food, much of it from the U.S., in, refugees out. For the fight crews diverted to relief from combat in Afghanistan, it isa dramatic shift. (UNKNOWN): I sat down and spoke to all the troops about turningthat switch off. But the first time I looked at those children needinghelp, I was no longer concerned. SCIUTTO: U.S. and Pakistani relief teams are fighting against theclock. This weekend, the first confirmed cases of cholera, apotentially deadly disease that's the result of the lack of cleandrinking water. For many Pakistanis, the flooding and its aftermath is a grittyreminder of all the ways the government has failed them, a ploddingresponse, a state budget dependent on fallen loans, shoddyinfrastructure. Seeking to take advantage of the chaos, the Taliban isdelivering help where the government is not, particularly in Swat, whichsaw the end of a massive anti-militant offensive just weeks ago. For the U.S., however, one sign of hope. America is deeplyunpopular here, but the relief effort is winning hearts and minds. Among them, the mayor of Bahrain, who told me the U.S. is outdoingPakistan's Muslim allies. (UNKNOWN): And in this disaster, the Islamic countries give theiraid after America. SCIUTTO (on-screen): Does that surprise you? (UNKNOWN): Yes, surprise, surprise. SCIUTTO: A good surprise? (UNKNOWN): Good surprise, yes. SCIUTTO: The first priority of the American relief effort is tohelp the millions in need, but U.S. officials will say very openly it'salso intended to improve America's dismal image here. Sixty-eightpercent of Pakistanis view the U.S. negatively, and the sight of thoseAmerican helicopters a very tangible form of outreach. And, Christiane, on a lot of that food going in, we've seen themlabeled very prominently with American flags. AMANPOUR: Jim, indeed. Let's just talk a little bit more aboutthat, because you mentioned the disapproval rate because of the dronestrikes, because of going after terrorists that kill quite a lot ofcivilians. How are you noticing that in these areas Americans areactually being received warmly because of this aid? SCIUTTO: Well, we see them getting hugged. They're getting kissesliterally on the ground from these troops and thanks, gratitude for thisaid that they're in desperate need of. That said, nationally, the Pakistani media is not covering the U.S. relief effort very closely. They're focusing -- perhaps notsurprisingly -- on the Pakistani relief effort. And in a sign of thesensitivity of simply being associated with the U.S., the U.S. will notidentify local Pakistani NGOs that it's giving aid to so it doesn't openup the risk that they're subject -- that they're targeted for terrorattacks. AMANPOUR: And, Jim, very quickly, the Pakistani troops, are theybeing diverted from fighting the militants? SCIUTTO: Well, there are 50,000 Pakistani troops involved in thisrelief effort. Pakistani officials say that none of them have beendiverted from the border or from counterterror operations. And U.S. officials that we've spoken to today say they believe thosereassurances. And they say, Christiane, that counterterror operationswith the Pakistanis are underway as we speak. AMANPOUR: Jim, thanks so much, from Islamabad. And in response to my questions on the disaster, you can seecomments from U.S. Special Representative to Afghanistan and PakistanRichard Holbrooke on our Web site at abcnews.com/thisweek. And coming up next, the president's decision to weigh in on thecontroversial Islamic center near Ground Zero on our roundtable withCokie Roberts, Matthew Dowd, David Ignatius, and Chrystia Freeland. (UNKNOWN): How is that healing, by building a mosque, anin-your-face mosque at Ground Zero? (UNKNOWN): It's like spraying swastikas all over a Jewish memorial. BLOOMBERG: We would be untrue to the best part of ourselves and whowe are as New Yorkers and Americans if we said no to a mosque in lowerManhattan. KING: This is such a sensitive issue. This, to me, is such a wrongplace to have a mosque such as this. OBAMA: I believe that Muslims have the right to practice theirreligion, as everyone else in this country. That includes the right tobuild a place of worship and a community center on private property inlower Manhattan in accordance with local laws and ordinances. AMANPOUR: The president waded into the controversy over the Islamiccenter near Ground Zero, one of the topics that we'll be discussing thismorning in our roundtable, with political strategist Matthew Dowd,Chrystia Freeland of Thomson Reuters, David Ignatius of the WashingtonPost, and our own Cokie Roberts. George Will is still on vacation. Thank you all for joining us. You did see that speech by thepresident on Friday night at the Iftar Ramadan dinner at the WhiteHouse. Why do you think he said that then? ROBERTS: I think he said that then because he actually believesthat, but the real question is, why that he didn't say the next daysomething more? Do you want to talk about that? AMANPOUR: Yes, we do, because we're going to put up some pollnumbers and just show everybody what the poll numbers are on thisissue. One poll says, when they ask about what people think about theplan to build the mosque, that only 30 percent say it's appropriate and64 percent say it's wrong, but when they say do the Muslim group have aright to build the mosque, 61 percent say yes and 34 percent say no. So I guess, is that, do you think, what caused the backtracking? Although those poll numbers were out before the speech on Friday night. Listen to what the president said in the gulf in Florida on Saturday,yesterday. OBAMA: I was not commenting and I will not comment on the wisdom ofmaking a decision to put a mosque there. I was commenting veryspecifically on the right that people have that dates back to ourfounding. That's what our country is about. ROBERTS: That's really not what he was doing. I mean, if youlisten -- as you played the whole first part of what he said -- he saidthey have a right to build on private property, all of that, and --granted, he didn't say it's wise to build on private property, but itwas very clearly an endorsement. And then to walk back from it is justso silly. He's already taken all the flack for having said it. DOWD: I think they figured out this is a real political problemthey have. And I think they either had a tin ear at the beginning ofthis and how it was going to come across or they mishandled it totallyfrom the beginning, because if they understood, I think, the public onthis, where two-thirds of the public say they have a right buttwo-thirds of the public say don't do it, he would have given a speechgoing directly to those points, instead of saying -- one day saying theyhave the right and the next day saying I didn't necessarily say it wasthe right thing to do. I think this is a big problem for the president, because it feeds abroader narrative about him, which is, it's my way or the highway. Inmany ways, to me, it reminds me of Bush, which is, is, ""I don't carewhere the American public is on this. I'm going to say what I think isthe right thing to do."" He did on -- he's done it on immigration in Arizona. He's done iton this. He's done it on health care. I think that's the politicalproblem... IGNATIUS: ... problem for him. I thought that the speech Fridaynight was a model of political courage, in the sense that he said whathe believed knowing that it was going to cost him. The White House hasstayed out of this issue knowing that it's political poison, and I thinkthe president spoke to it fairly directly. This is America. Peoplehave a right to build on property that they own, even if it's going tobe a mosque near Ground Zero. He said -- I was sort of sorry that he was trying to walk it back inthese more nuanced comments yesterday. FREELAND: I totally agree with David. And I think, you know, Matt,too, the point of my way or the highway, another way of talking aboutthat is leadership, conviction, having your beliefs, and not governingaccording to polls. And I think if you asked most Americans, what kind of a leader doyou want, if you ask people in the world what kind of a leader, you wantsomeone who governs according to conviction. And I do think this touches on, Christiane, the economic panel thatyou had earlier. I think that it touches on it in two important ways. This point about private property might seem like a parsing, but it isactually essential. And I think to have the president -- and we had similar commentsfrom Mike Bloomberg coming out and saying, actually, we believe that therights of private property are so strong, we are not going to changethem because -- because... AMANPOUR: But there are two issues, Cokie. Where does this go fromnow? I mean, where does it actually go? Is this now a line drawn underit? ROBERTS: No, I think that... AMANPOUR: ... to get built? ROBERTS: Well, that's -- that's an issue that I certainly can'tanswer, but I -- my guess is, eventually it does get built and that itbecomes no problem. But the -- but the political issue will continue, because eventhough the president's remarks Friday night started a firestorm, I thinkthe backtracking is even worse, because, you know, you can make a casethat what he said Friday night is just a matter of fact, it is anAmerican right, but to keep -- to keep saying, well, now I'm not sureabout this, and then what tomorrow is like... AMANPOUR: ... I just want to ask you, because it does go to theheart of what he's been doing since the beginning of his presidency,reaching out to the -- not just the Muslim world, but to Muslims ingeneral. And he made a very important first interview, where he saidthe United States could not afford to have yet another generation ofMuslims viewing it as the enemy. So do you think it's wise to have this huge hubbub over it or itshould just go forward, this mosque? DOWD: Well, he would -- the president would like this to sort ofjust go away and not have a huge hubbub about this. The problem is, isthat two-thirds of the country are opposed to him on this. That's aproblem for a president of the United States. I think he is in totally -- he states what's in the Constitution. They have a right to build it. That's not the point in this. That isnot the point in this. You have a right for free speech. It doesn'tmean that you can go and like yell... IGNATIUS: Standing up for free speech for Muslims is -- is a pointin this climate. FREELAND: Where is that not the point? DOWD: But it -- it -- the point is, is that you have to buildconsensus on this. Tolerance goes two ways. Tolerance goes two ways. Tolerance is the tolerance to somebody to build on private property whatthey want, but tolerance also is to recognize what that symbolicallysays to a whole bunch of people in this country. And if you don'trecognize that, you're going to have this kind of furor. AMANPOUR: Do you think it should go ahead? DOWD: Do I think it should go ahead? No. I think he should calltogether the people -- there's many Muslims and many people in the Arabcommunity that are very worried about this happening, actually, thatthey voiced in there. I think he or somebody should call together something, put this onhold for a little while, bring together some consensus about what peopleshould do, because right now, it's white hot. AMANPOUR: But what do you do then? It is white hot -- you'reabsolutely right -- right now. But what do you do when the actualowners, the people who want to build this are in the moderate stream ofMuslims, did go to the White House? You were there when they did, when-- when this gentleman did, condemned 9/11, condemned extremism,condemned terrorism, and now they're faced with this situation? ROBERTS: Well, there are -- there are ways always of making thesesituations just less hot. And it is a question of suggesting otherplaces, providing other places. Those kinds of things can always beworked out. FREELAND: But let's talk a little bit about the rest of the world. You know, I think that actually the president's comments, the commentsby Mike Bloomberg are a really important message to the Muslim world. And we're going to be talking about Pakistan later on. For thesepeople, for American leaders to say, in the space of, you know, somepolitical pressure from their voters, to say, actually, we believesufficiently strongly in diversity, in private property rights for ourAmerican citizens, I think that's a great... IGNATIUS: ... our strongest -- our strongest suits. ROBERTS: ... coming back from it is the problem. IGNATIUS: As the world looks at us, if they see that the UnitedStates -- even in -- you know, an issue that hurts -- and Ground Zerohurts -- even on that issue, we still stand up for the freedom of peopleto dispose of their property as they want, that does count. When I travel, you travel, Christiane, you know, we hear commentsabout that America a lot. And I think you shouldn't minimize thebenefits of -- of saying to moderate Muslims, ""Here you are. Thisupsets a lot of Americans, but we're""... FREELAND: ... if the people you're being tolerant of... DOWD: There's two freedoms in conflict here. There's two freedomsin conflict. There's the freedom to build on your private property andthen the freedom for people to protest and say this is not what we want. IGNATIUS: Understood. DOWD: I think the president obviously has to lead in this countryand lead in the world. The problem with this one is he is speaking froma position of weakness, not a position of strength. And so if he doesnot have consensus... AMANPOUR: Why do you say that? DOWD: He is in a total position -- his approval numbers in thiscountry are in the low 40s. He's perceived as not able to handle allthe major issues in this country right now. The vast majority of thiscountry right now questions his leadership. For him to go out on an issue like this that is white hot and thensay, ""I'm going to say it, and I'm going to lead the rest of the world,""while two-thirds of this country is in another place, is a real problemfor him. AMANPOUR: So, clearly, the consensus appears that it should havebeen arranged, debated, done in a slightly better way between those whowanted to actually build it and the community, whether they're Jewishmembers of the community, Christians, or other Muslims. And one of the tragedies seems to me that the actual imam wastalking -- and his wife -- to the -- to the people who put up the Jewishcommunity center in New York and was talking about how to have somethingsimilar like that. And it seems to have all gone awry. Let's move on to politics, because this week was also -- and this is(inaudible) was primary week in -- in -- in many states. Some have saida group of sort of -- political playbook said oddball character iscoming out of right field. What -- whether you believe or agree withthat or not -- do you think is the effect of those who've won in someareas, the Tea Party candidates, those who supported? DOWD: Well, it's interesting. ABC, I think over the last couple ofmonths, has done a great job of sort of gauging the frustration thatexists in this country, and it's high as it was in 1992, as high as it'sbeen in 2008. It's not just limited to Republicans. It's independentsand some Democrats in this. I think these primaries have shown that there are some places whereit's real anger that's related to frustration and then it's other placeswhich a majority (ph) which is related to frustration. I think the Republican Party right now, it is the comparison betweena bonfire there and a campfire in the Democratic primary. So you canhandle the campfire, but the bonfire, which is what helped elect TeaParty people and what's gone on across just headed into November. I think this is perilous for both parties, actually. I think it'sperilous for the Republicans if they become the Tea Party folks, whichare sort of out of the mainstream and are going to have a hard timewinning November elections, but it's also perilous, I think, for theDemocrats if they ignore this level of frustration and they don't dealwith it. ROBERTS: That's right. They -- now, they've had plenty of time tolearn about it, and they've had town meetings and heard about it and allthat, so they're not going to be taken by surprise. But they think thatthey can just go back to the old playbook, so they're pulling out SocialSecurity, and they're running against George Bush, and they're doingthings that have worked for them in the past that I'm not at all surewill work for them this year, and that could be a real problem, becausethey're not understanding the level of frustration. IGNATIUS: The Democrats sound this year with this president likethe party of the establishment. And we have a political firestorm outin the country. People are really angry. They're angry at Washington. They're angry about the economy. The Tea Party is an expression ofthat, but what Robert Gibbs, the president's press secretary, wascalling the professional left is another example of that, people whojust are angry at the mainstream, centrist views the president often hasbeen espousing. And I think that's a real problem for them. They don't have theenergy. They're not tapping into this energy source as they headtowards the elections. FREELAND: Well, doesn't it just all come down to the economy? ROBERTS: Well, sure. Sure. FREELAND: I mean, you know, I don't want to be too simplistic, butwith unemployment at nearly 10 percent, I thought the comments that JonCorzine made earlier were right on, that this is a double whammy, thisis a recession following a financial crisis, and this is also the finalact of America's structural adjustment to globalization and thetechnology revolution. That's a really big deal. And I think the real problem is not --you know, we're going to be focused a lot on messaging and cosmeticsahead of the midterms. The real question is, can an American politicalparty or political movement come up with a powerful economic plan, andone that is maybe really different? And we're seeing that happen in other countries. Look at Britain. David Cameron's Tories won with a really radical plan, and they gotactually... IGNATIUS: ... just doesn't work. I mean, it's not like they didn'thave a plan. DOWD: Republicans don't really have to come up with anything overthe next 90 days. ROBERTS: No, that's right. DOWD: They're going to win a huge amount of seats in the House, ahuge amount of seats in the Senate. They're going to win a bunch ofgovernors' races. To me, the economy is representative of a bigger issue that's outthere. I agree the economy is the number-one issue. The problem is, ispeople out there do not think Washington is listening to them. Theydon't think they're paying attention to what's going on in America. And the reason why the economy is so -- has so much anger in it isbecause people don't think they're being empathetic with where they arein their life. And that's, I think, a problem. ROBERTS: But they're also -- you know, the voters were also veryambivalent themselves, because on the one hand, the furious... ROBERTS: Right, exactly. They're furious with Washington for beingfurious and for everybody fighting with each other and why doesn'tanything work, and yet they're furious and feed into that partisanshiptremendously so that there's no right answer for the politicians as theygo to face the voters. AMANPOUR: But also these primaries this week, the White House andDemocrats were saying that it's not such a bad bag. We (inaudible)comfort from some of the results there. ROBERTS: Well, because they were able to re-nominate Michael Bennetin Colorado, and that made them feel good, because they had backed him. But, you know, Newt Gingrich had backed Nathan Deal in Georgia, too, andhe won against Sarah Palin's candidate. So, you know... AMANPOUR: What does that say about the sort of star of the TeaParty movement? DOWD: Well, I mean, endorsements always to me are questionableanyway, because the voters ultimately make the decision. I think stillSarah Palin -- Sarah Palin on the Republican side has the most energyand emotion and passion behind her than any other candidate. She canstill walk into a city and get 3,000, 5,000 people. No one can dothat. So she can have that emotionally. She can charge that, andultimately it's about her. I think the interesting thing on the results is that, there's thisbig wave coming into Washington, and Democrats have a seawall. Andwhat's happened now is Republicans have nominated people that may not beable to win. And so basically the Republicans are putting bricks on topof the seawall and building it higher, that they're going to have lesschance of winning in this election because of who they've nominated insome of these places. IGNATIUS: You know, their biggest problem would be... ROBERTS: Working on that seawall. IGNATIUS: ... I suspect, if they -- if they did win. Suppose theRepublicans did win control of the House and the Senate. What wouldthey do? What would their program be? You know, they'd be a mucheasier mark for the Democrats heading toward the 2012 presidentialelection. You almost think it would be better for Obama... ROBERTS: Well, of course it would be better for Obama. FREELAND: You can try to triangulate... DOWD: ... 2012 if the Republicans took one of the branches, becausethey could either do one of two things which would be beneficial tohim. He could compromise and then show him, he's going to buildbridges, or he could just say, ""They're the problem, they're the problem."" The fear I think the White House has is he's going to get the worstpossible result, which is a small margin in the House, a small margin inthe Senate, he can't get anything done, but he owns all the levers ofgovernment... AMANPOUR: So now that we've settled that one, let's move right outof the country to Pakistan briefly, because we did talk about it withJim Sciutto, but it's been likened to their Katrina. The U.S. is doingthe right thing sending relief, right? DOWD: Yes, absolutely. AMANPOUR: Politically, economically. ROBERTS: Humanitarian. AMANPOUR: Humanitarian, of course... FREELAND: Strategically. AMANPOUR: Exactly. What do you think, though, when you look atthis, here's the fight, here's Pakistan nuclear-armed, here's Pakistanhaving done the right thing, to an extent, having sent its army afterthe militants, and all of that, all of that just about being washed awayliterally. IGNATIUS: Here -- Christiane, here's a country on the edge, acountry that's $11 billion in debt to the IMF, barely staggering along,that's fighting an insurgency at home, and all of a sudden, pow, it getshit with this terrible flood. The latest Pakistani estimate is thatthere are 20 million people who are affected in the country. And the question that people are beginning to raise is, is the floodgoing to be the final additional thing that pushes Pakistan into being afailed state? The army is going to have to focus on rebuilding roads,getting food to people -- I mean the Pakistani army here, hopefully withhelp from the U.S. military -- but that means they won't be able tofight the Taliban. I was expecting that there would be an offensive in North Waziristanagainst the Taliban and Al Qaida this fall. I was even going to go look-- go travel with the Pakistani troops. I have a feeling now themilitary will be too busy, and that's just one sign... ROBERTS: Maybe it doesn't matter, though. Maybe -- maybe the factis -- I mean, this is -- this is wishful thinking -- but maybe the factis, is having all of this aid come in from the West -- and particularlyfrom the United States -- and it is our military... DOWD: Almost solely from the United States. ROBERTS: ... also -- right, and it's -- and it's not just ourmilitary. It's USAID and all of our humanitarian organizations. I workwith Save the Children there, and we've been in Pakistan for 30 yearsand doing this kind of work. Seeing that is more important than sayingwe can build a mosque in Manhattan, in terms of dealing with the Muslimworld. FREELAND: Well, that presupposes that the aid is effective. And Ithink to David's point, the other danger -- it's not just that thePakistani army is not in a position now to go on the offensive againstthe Taliban. I think the real danger here is that you find the localIslamic organizations, extremist Islamic organizations turning out to bemore effective at helping... IGNATIUS: ... a lot of people angry... FREELAND: I think that -- I think that... FREELAND: ... why Western support, particularly U.S. support, is soimportant right now. You know, U.S. policy has to try hard to make thePakistanis feel it is not purely a utilitarian relationship, it's notjust transactional, that America cares about Pakistan, not just becauseof its relationship with Afghanistan and the Taliban. (UNKNOWN): Well, the only reason why we're in Pakistan is becauseit is transactional. FREELAND: Yes, so -- so... (UNKNOWN): And it's vital. (UNKNOWN): ... it's vital to our interests and to the interests ofthe world. FREELAND: ... works, because Pakistani... AMANPOUR: And we barely have any time left, but 30 seconds to talkabout Russia about to put the nuclear fuel into the Bushehr plant insouthern Iran. IGNATIUS: If you wanted one more piece of bad news this week forthe Obama administration, it would be that Russia, which has really beenvery cooperative on Iran, which has joined us in U.N. sanctions thathave been tougher than people expected, has decided that it's going toship -- next week it's going to begin to operationalize a nuclearreactor in Iran, a civilian nuclear reactor that generates power. And,you know, that's the last thing this administration would have wanted. AMANPOUR: On that note -- on that note, the roundtable continues inthe green room at abcnews.com/thisweek, where you can also find our factchecks, in conjunction with PolitiFact. Also on our Web site now, dramatic images from Russia this week,where wildfires have ravaged that country. Choking smoke from the firesand record high temperatures have led to hundreds of deaths in Moscow,and the drought has destroyed a quarter of Russia's grain crops. It'snow banned exports, causing price spikes, and raising concerns of aglobal food crisis in the fall."	1

Aired 6-7p ETAired October 27, 2016 - 18:00 ETTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.[18:00:02]WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: And closing in. We're learning about a secret U.S. attack on ISIS, as coalition forces get ready to move on the terror group's self-proclaimed capital, the Pentagon growing more concerned that ISIS is plotting to attack America.We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.ANNOUNCER: This is CNN breaking news.BLITZER: Breaking news tonight, Michelle Obama pleading with North Carolina voters to cast early ballots for Hillary Clinton right now. Clinton campaigning with her most popular surrogate for the first time in one of the battlegrounds that will decide the presidential race just 12 days from now.Tonight, just released polls show Clinton with a slim advantage in North Carolina, and she's in a dead heat with Donald Trump in Iowa and in the traditionally red state of Georgia. Right now, Trump is focusing in on the must-win battleground of Ohio. We're standing by for his third event in that state within a matter of hours. Trump, who had been dissing the polls, now applauding new surveys that show Florida and Nevada are tossups.Also breaking, Russian President Vladimir Putin says officials in the United States are whipping up hysteria when they blame the Kremlin for cyber-attacks on American political systems, Putin dismissing the allegations as a ploy designed to distract from the failings of U.S. leaders.I will talk presidential politics with a top Donald Trump supporter, Congressman Sean Duffy. He's standing by live, along with our correspondents and analysts, as we bring you full coverage of the day's top stories.Up first, let's go to CNN's Jeff Zeleny. He is in North Carolina for us, where Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton campaigned together now for the first time -- Jeff.JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, Michelle Obama has been traveling across the country as a seal of approval for Hillary Clinton's credibility and character.She stood side by side her today, acknowledging it's unprecedented for a first lady to be so involved in a presidential campaign. But she called this a truly unprecedented election. That's why she says she has Hillary Clinton's back and she is fighting to protect the Obama legacy.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)ZELENY (voice-over): For the first time, tonight, the first lady and a former one on stage together.MICHELLE OBAMA, FIRST LADY: She is absolutely ready to be commander in chief on day one. And, yes, she happens to be a woman.ZELENY: Rallying Democrats in North Carolina.HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Seriously, is there anyone more inspiring than Michelle Obama?ZELENY: A first lady tag team. Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama, going hard after Donald Trump in a race divided by deep gender lines.OBAMA: We want a president who values and honor women, who teaches our daughters and our sons that women are full and equal human beings worthy and deserving of love and respect.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)ZELENY: The Clinton campaign calls her their not-so-secret weapon, a tiring cliche, but a true one, that bluntly acknowledges Secretary Clinton needs Mrs. Obama.CLINTON: No one knows more about what's at stake in this election than our first lady.ZELENY: Sixteen years ago, in the closing months of Mrs. Clinton's time as first lady, she was running for Senate in New York. Mrs. Obama has no interest in being on the ballot now or ever, friends say. A comment she made in the 2008 campaign is now being revisited as a swipe at Clinton.OBAMA: If you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House.ZELENY: Just last week, Trump raising it in North Carolina.TRUMP: Wasn't she the one that originally started the statement, if you can't take care of your home, right?ZELENY: Aides to Obama say she was not talking about Clinton, who they say she respects and has grown fond of.OBAMA: Hillary Clinton is my friend.ZELENY: Now Clinton is hoping the popularity of both Obamas rubs off, the president's approval rating at 59 percent in a new CNN/ORC poll, and 54 percent believe things in the country are going well.The Clinton campaign's new balancing act, projecting confidence and warding off complacency. A CNN poll of polls, an average of the five latest national surveys, shows Clinton with a six-point edge over Trump. Tonight, the campaign bracing for even more hacked e-mails offering an unflattering look inside Clinton world.After ""The New York Times"" first reported Clinton's private e-mail server in March 2015, campaign chairman John Podesta sounded the alarm within hours. ""Did you have any idea of the depth of this story?"" he wrote to Robby Mook, the campaign manager. He replied, ""Nope. We brought up the existence of e-mails in research this summer, but were told that everything was taken care of.""Since then, Clinton and her campaign have tried to downplay it, yet Clinton confidants probably knew it was a problem, as former aide Neera Tanden made clear in an e-mail to Podesta last you're: ""Do we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private e-mail? And has that person been drawn and quartered?"" -- going on to say, ""Like, the whole thing is 'expletive' insane.""(END VIDEOTAPE)[18:05:12]ZELENY: There's no question the leaks, this release of these e-mails is rocking the campaign.One aide told me today it's taking away some of the joy they thought they would have in the final days here, Wolf. They're also keeping close track through focus groups and polling to make sure voters aren't being affected by this.That's why they're trying to lock in the early vote now. In fact, at this moment, Secretary Clinton still here in North Carolina speaking to more voters. They are trying to get these 15 electoral votes.Wolf, it was just earlier this summer where she paid a visit to North Carolina with President Obama for the first time. No coincidence she came back to North Carolina with Michelle Obama in tow still trying to get the Obama coalition fired up for her candidacy -- Wolf.BLITZER: All right, Jeff, thank you, good report, Jeff Zeleny reporting.Let's go to Ohio right now for the latest on Donald Trump's message with just a dozen days to go until the election.Sunlen Serfaty is on the scene for us.Sunlen, Trump has a narrow path to 270 electoral votes, but a win in Ohio could certainly make a difference.SUNLEN SERFATY, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Ohio certainly is must- win for the Trump campaign, Wolf, which is why we're seeing them make such a big push here in Ohio, three states -- for Donald Trump in this state today alone.Trump campaign advisers openly admit their path to 270 is, in their words, an uphill climb. But they're also looking at these recent battleground polls, state polls, including here in Ohio, Ohio, which show that the race is tightening. So they are seeing that they are now in a better position than they were just a week ago.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)SERFATY (voice-over): Donald Trump blanketing the battleground state of Ohio today.TRUMP: In 12 days, we're going to win Ohio, and we are going to win back the White House.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)SERFATY: The state and its 18 electoral votes critical to Trump's path to the White House.TRUMP: Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare a make it even worse.SERFATY: With less than two weeks left in the campaign, Trump is staying on the attack against Clinton and seizing on the steady drip of hacked e-mails from Clinton's campaign chairman coming from WikiLeaks.TRUMP: If the Clintons were willing to play this fast and loose with their enterprise when they weren't in the White House, just imagine what they will do given the chance to once again control the Oval Office.SERFATY: Even as he backs off his recent threat to sue the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct.TRUMP: All of these liars will be sued after the election is over.SERFATY: No longer saying he will go through with it.TRUMP: We will find out. Let's see what happens with the election. We're going to find out.SERFATY: Trump revealing today his campaign is planning to deploy his wife, Melania, for a series of closing speeches.TRUMP: She has agreed to do two or three speeches, and I think it's going to be big speeches, important speeches.SERFATY: Melania has been largely absent from the campaign trail since her convention speech in July. But the Trump campaign is leaning on her voice now to help improve her husband's standing with women.MELANIA TRUMP, WIFE OF DONALD TRUMP: I support him 100 percent, and I am there for him every time he needs me, and I am going to join him. SERFATY: Meantime, Trump reclaiming some support in the new tossupstate of Utah from Congressman Jason Chaffetz. The Republican withdrew his support after Trump's sexually aggressive comments about women in 2005 were made public.REP. JASON CHAFFETZ (R), UTAH: I am out. I can no longer endorse Donald Trump for president. We have a 15-year-old daughter. You think I can look her in the eye and tell her that I endorse Donald Trump for president when he acts like this and his apology?SERFATY: But now, after nearly a dozen women have come forward to accuse Trump of sexual assault or harassment, Chaffetz is saying -- quote -- ""I will not defend nor endorse Donald Trump, but I am voting for him. HRC is that bad.""Some Republicans are considering the prospects of a Clinton administration. Chaffetz, chair of the House Oversight Committee, promising years of congressional investigations, telling ""The Washington Post"" -- quote -- ""Even before we get to day one, we have got two years' worth of material already lined up.""And Senator Ted Cruz warning Republicans might not vote on the nomination for the Supreme Court seat vacated by the death of Justice Scalia.SEN. TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS: There's certainly long historical precedent with a Supreme Court with fewer justices.(END VIDEOTAPE)SERFATY: And in that interview where Donald Trump today revealed that his wife, Melania, would be making two or three big speeches in the final stretch for him, Melania seemed a bit off-guard by that. She seemed surprised by that suggestion.And the Trump campaign, Wolf, they have not gotten back on specifics where or when those big speeches very Melania would be given in this final stretch -- Wolf.[18:10:01]BLITZER: All right, we will be anxious to cover those speeches, if they take place.Sunlen, thanks very, very much.In the last hour, I spoke to Democratic Senator and Hillary Clinton supporter Chris Coons.Now we're joined now by a top Donald Trump supporter, Republican Congressman Sean Duffy.Congressman, thanks very much for joining us.REP. SEAN DUFFY (R), WISCONSIN: Hey. It's good to be back with you, Wolf. BLITZER: Let's talk about some of these new polls that just came outtoday showing Donald Trump losing his lead, get this, in states he had been doing very well in. In Georgia, for example, a traditionally red state, right now, he's only behind by one -- she's only behind by one point, 44 percent for Trump, 43 percent for Hillary Clinton.Look at Iowa right now. In Iowa, he had been doing really well, 44 percent, 44 percent. A month ago, both of those states, Trump was up by seven points in both states. Why is he slipping?DUFFY: Well, first off, I think Georgia is not going to be a problem for Donald Trump. That's a Republican state. As voters go to the polls, they will break Donald Trump's way. We will win Georgia.But, obviously, some of the trouble that Donald Trump has had over the last month has caused him to slip not just in Iowa, but in all these states and the national polls across the country.But what's interesting, Wolf, is he's actually come back in dramatic fashion. And you have been talking about this all day, but in Florida, North Carolina, in Iowa, Ohio, Nevada, and I will tell you, Wisconsin is doing incredibly well for Mr. Trump. So he has this inside track. He has to hit everything right. But if he does, he's within striking distance in these swing states, and he could pull this victory out.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: We checked, Congressman, in your home state of Wisconsin. The last poll that we have, a scientific poll, Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin was up by seven points in Wisconsin. So do you think he really has a chance of capturing Wisconsin?DUFFY: I do.So, in Wisconsin, this was the home of the Scott Walker recalls. The Republican Party in Wisconsin is the best Republican Party in the country. We are turning out almost as many door-knocks and phone calls as Florida and Ohio. And so our base is activated.Now, we still have a little problem in Southeast Wisconsin with the Republicans. But as those Republicans come home, with all the work we have done across the state, this will be a nail-biter. And I think Wisconsin will go to Trump in the end.BLITZER: Yes, but every poll we have seen, Hillary Clinton in your state of Wisconsin is up seven or eight points.Is Trump, has he been there lately, is he planning on going in the final 12 days? Or has he basically written off Wisconsin?DUFFY: I have seen internal polls as well. And we try to get the best and most accurate data possible so we can function with good data.And I would say it's far closer than the recent poll that you cite. But so Mr. Trump was here, oh, a little over a week ago. I'm hopeful, and there's been rumblings that he might come back, whether it's this coming weekend or early next week. But he knows that outside of, again, Florida, North Carolina, Iowa, Ohio, Nevada, he needs another state.And if it's not Pennsylvania, and I think Pennsylvania is getting really tough to grab for him, I think Wisconsin is the next best play. Again, a great ground game, an activated Republican base, and the internal polls that I have seen, it's much closer than the ones that you have cited.BLITZER: How much of a problem in Wisconsin -- the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan is, of course, from Wisconsin. He's a friend of yours. He's doing nothing. He's not campaigning out there in Wisconsin or, for that matter, anyplace else for Donald Trump, is he?DUFFY: Well, so, well, what he's done is, he's funded the whole Wisconsin GOP operation.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: But he's trying to get Republicans elected in Wisconsin, but I don't see him out there on the campaign trail with Donald Trump or even speaking about Donald Trump, for that matter.DUFFY: We have to be frank.We have far more House seats that are in play today than they were six weeks ago. So Mr. Ryan is out there talking about the Republican message, the Republican vision, and also raising money to make sure we can push back against an onslaught of Democrat cash that's just raining a bit of hellfire on us. They have way more money than we do.And so Mr. Ryan is out there making sure we have the resources to fight back. And that's a full-time job. So, he's working on keeping the House. Donald Trump is working on winning the presidency. And those are two different jobs that take two different roles and two different missions.BLITZER: But the point I'm trying to make, and you know this well, Paul Ryan in Wisconsin especially, he's very popular in your home state.DUFFY: Yes.BLITZER: If he were out there speaking publicly, not only trying to get Republicans elected in the House and the Senate, governor's races or whatever, but if he were out there really actively promoting Donald Trump, that could make a difference.DUFFY: It could, but, Wolf, I don't want to speak for Paul. I haven't had this conversation with him, so I'm going to surmise here. I want to be clear on that.But there's a lot of Republicans across the country, they might be down in their districts by -- or Mr. Trump might be down in their districts by maybe 15 points or 20 points. So, they have to outperform him by big numbers.[18:15:07]And so Paul is not just looking at Wisconsin, and how Wisconsin plays for Mr. Trump. He's looking at our national playing field and how he has to make sure that we come back and we're in the majority, we don't have Speaker Nancy Pelosi.And so he doesn't wear just one hat. He wears multiple hats. And I will just tell you, Donald Trump is doing just fine here himself. And, listen, do I suspect that Mr. Ryan is going to vote for Donald Trump? I suspect so. And we will see.BLITZER: Donald Trump tweeted this today, and I will put it up on the screen, Congressman. He tweeted this.He said: ""A lot of call-ins about vote-flipping at the voting booths in Texas. People are not happy. Big lines. What is going on?""Election officials say that they have had some human error basically in some of the tablets. They have got electronic voting there. But they don't think it's a big problem. Is he raising this problem to suggest that the entire election system, as he keeps saying, is rigged?DUFFY: Well, from my perspective, I have heard the same stories about the voting machines switching votes.We know that dead people across America are still voting, miraculously. And we know that some people are voting twice. Now, do I think that's so widespread, Wolf, that it's going to take the election away from Hillary Clinton or from Donald Trump? I don't think that's the case.But on these electronic voting machines, I don't like them. I think -- and this is what we do in my district here in Wisconsin. You fill out your paper ballot and then you put it through the electronic reader, but you can go back and look at the paper ballots, as opposed to just having everything electronic.And if someone has messed with the programming, that can tweak the results of a race. And I don't have any evidence or information that there's any widespread problems across the country. But I do think it's incumbent upon us as Americans and as elected American officials that we try to get the best result possible, which is clear the dead folks out.Make sure there's swift and significant penalties for those who violate the laws and vote more than once. And we make sure that if you are using an electronic voting system, that it is fully functioning and is going to accurately reflect the votes of the people who came and cast their ballot.BLITZER: Yes. But in Texas, the authorities say the tablet, the electronic voting machine, it is working fine, but people are -- some people are making some mistakes, human error, they say. They're not necessarily following the instructions that they get.But it's not big, they say. There's been a few problems like that. But they're not suggesting it's a big problem.DUFFY: And one other point on that, and will just -- these articles that I have read, I haven't verified them.But we heard the one of George Soros' companies has provided some of the machines for some of these states. And, obviously, Mr. Soros leans left. I haven't personally verified that yet.But, again, I think we want to make sure that these voting machines and systems are free of politics and policy, because this great American system, this election, is based on the trust of the American people. And I don't think we want to undermine that trust in our electoral process.BLITZER: We have to take a quick break.But it's Republican officials in Texas who are saying this is not a big problem with these voting tablets, if you will. And that George Soros issue, that is an unconfirmed rumor certainly that has spread out there. But we have not been able to confirm that, by any means, that the machines maybe that his company is building are designed to help Hillary Clinton and not Donald Trump, for that matter.That sounds conspiratorial.DUFFY: I agree.BLITZER: But let's take a quick break, Congressman. We will resume our coverage right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: We're back with Republican Congressman and Donald Trump supporter Sean Duffy.Congressman, I would like you to stand by for a moment.We're getting some new information about Vladimir Putin latest response to claims that Russia is attempting to influence the U.S. presidential election.Our chief national security correspondent, Jim Sciutto, is with us.Jim, Putin says it's all a ploy?JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: That's right.And it's interesting, because we have heard Donald Trump occasionally praise the leadership style of Vladimir Putin. Today, we heard Vladimir Putin, to some degree, defending Donald Trump's campaigning style, even making some points, expressing some talking points seemingly stolen from the Donald Trump playbook. Have a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Donald Trump behaves extravagantly. Of course, we see this. But I think there's a reason for this, because, in my opinion, he represents the interests of that part of society, and it is quite big in the United States, which is tired of the elite who have been in power for decades.(END VIDEO CLIP)SCIUTTO: Tired of the elite in power for decades. You heard Donald Trump say that about Hillary Clinton in the last debate.But on this issue who is behind these election hacks, of course Russia has denied that from the beginning. Vladimir Putin has denied that multiple times. But today he sort of jokingly dismissed the whole idea. Have a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PUTIN (through translator): Does anyone seriously think that Russia can in some way influence the choice the American people? Is America some kind of a banana republic? America is a great country. Correct me if I'm wrong.(END VIDEO CLIP)SCIUTTO: The could there went on to laugh at that a little bit there, this idea of America as a banana republic. But, again, the fact is, U.S. intelligence agencies, Department of Homeland Security took the rare step of naming and shaming Russia in public for these hacks, you will remember, Wolf, even saying it would have required the most senior levels of the Russian government, namely Vladimir Putin, to approve hacks like this.BLITZER: Jim Sciutto, thanks very much for that report.Let's get back to Congressman Sean Duffy.Congressman, your colleague Mike McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee and an adviser, a national security adviser, to Donald Trump, he says he told Trump Russia was behind these election hacks. Trump didn't think that was enough proof.[18:25:05]But Trump is also questioning his Republican colleagues and the intelligence community, for that matter, when generals as far as this ongoing fight against ISIS.When you hear all of this from Trump, how will he function if he's elected as president of the United States if he doesn't trust the intelligence community, for example?DUFFY: Well, just to take a side note, it's Barack Obama who has been changing the intelligence that is coming out of the Middle East to make it rosier to fit a narrative...(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Hold on a second.Are you accusing the director of national intelligence, the CIA director, the NSA director, all 16, 17 intelligence agencies of being manipulated by the president of the United States for political reasons?DUFFY: No, what I'm saying is, and these are well-vetted stories about insiders who have provided intelligence reports about what's happening in the Middle East in Iraq, with Syria, and with Afghanistan, of modifying the reports that have come out of their intelligence...(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Mike McCaul is a Republican. He's the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. He's from Texas. He's highly respected. Is he being manipulated as well?DUFFY: No, I didn't say that he was.I said that the mid-level folks that are writing reports on the ground reporting on our effectiveness in the Middle East on our policy against terror, those reports have been modified. And the people who have written reports have come forward and expressed that openly and publicly.Now, Mike McCaul is a friend of mine. He's a straight-shooting guy, but I think he's heard the same story. I'm not saying that these reports are wrong that are coming out about Russia. All I'm saying is, your question went to the point of, can you be an effective president if you have bad intelligence?Well, Mr. Obama, some would argue, has been an effective president, some would say he hasn't, but he also has had bad intelligence.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: No, no, I didn't say if he had intelligence. I said if he's not listening to the intelligence community and accepting their bottom-line assertions about what is going on, can you be an effective president if you don't pay attention to their conclusions?DUFFY: So, let's go to the point.I don't care if it's Russia, if it's the Tooth Fairy or the devil that provides this information. The bottom line is, we're seeing a pay- for-play scandal. You give money to the State Department or the Clinton Foundation, you get access to the Clinton State Department.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Hold on, Congressman. Do you care if Russia is trying to interfere by hacking various e-mail accounts, DNC, Democratic National Committee, or other e-mail accounts associated with Democrats, do you care if they're trying to influence the American election system so that Trump is elected?DUFFY: What I would argue is, if -- do I care about that? Of course.But then if we have this information through the intelligence services of the United States of America, let's put it out there. Let's show how Russia is actually doing this.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: But you know, Congressman, sometimes, the intelligence community -- hold on a second. They have to protect what they call sources and methods. They can't necessarily reveal that kind of information, because it undermines national security.You're familiar with that.DUFFY: Sure, but there's a lot of sources and a lot of information they can release without releasing all of it and jeopardizing the tools that they use to get that information.But that aside, Wolf, I want to tell you that I don't think it helps Donald Trump at all to have any ties to Putin. If anyone thinks that Putin saying nice things about Donald Trump is helpful in this election, it's absolutely not. Mr. Putin is a thug. He's not a friend of ours.And I think anyone that cozies up or says nice things about Mr. Putin, I fundamentally disagree with. And the Russians are smart. If they're trying to help Donald Trump, why would Mr. Putin say nice things about Mr. Trump? Because he knows that that just stirs up a lot of anger within the American voting base.BLITZER: But what's intriguing to a lot of experts, and I'm sure it is to you, at least so far, all of the hacked e-mails, for example, have been damaging to the Democrats, not to the Republicans. So far, no Republican National Committee e-mails or Trump e-mails, for that matter, Trump campaign e-mails, have been hacked. Or at least they haven't been released.And that's why people are pointing to the Russians, by and large, and they're saying it's designed to undermine Hillary Clinton and the Democrats and help Trump. That's the argument.DUFFY: And I understand the argument, and I kind of look to what Marco Rubio said.I don't know that any of us like when e-mails are hacked. They should be private. But I would also note, Wolf, that there's a lot of serious things that are happening within Clinton world that have come out that give people great cause about her ability to serve effectively as the next president of the United States of America.We have issues of, again, corruption. The fact that she had this private server and didn't protect American top-secret information. The fact that she came to Congress and said she didn't have this secure information on her server, and then Mr. Comey came in and said no, actually, on that server, she did have top-secret information.[18:30:27] All of this is relevant, and I think it's important -- and I told you this before -- I want to know as much information about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. I want to know the good, the bad, and the ugly so I can make the best decision on November 8. And I think every American deserves that.And as you've seen from these e-mails, I wish that Hillary Clinton would have done what her staffers advised her: say ""I had a server."" Apologize for it. Put out the paid speeches to Wall Street. And don't Bleach Bit 33,000 e-mails. Put them out there. Be transparent.BLITZER: Congressman...DUFFY: And Wolf, if she did that, this wouldn't even be a race, I don't think. She would be walking away with it, because she was honest and transparent, and she asked for forgiveness; and Americans give forgiveness when you ask for it.BLITZER: Congressman, you make fair points on that issue, which is -- which is a fair issue for discussion, but it's a separate issue from whether or not Russia is deliberately releasing stolen or hacked e- mails in order to interfere in the American democratic election system. Those are two separate issues that we're discussing right now.DUFFY: They are.BLITZER: We'll continue these conversations down the road. Sean Duffy, the congressman from Wisconsin. Appreciate it very much.Just ahead, the First Ladies' Club, how Michelle Obama's pitch for Hillary Clinton could help.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHELLE OBAMA, FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: For the past eight years, I have had the great honor of being this country's first lady. First ladies, we rock.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[18:36:37] BLITZER: The breaking news this hour: Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama campaigning together for the first time.The first lady fired up a crowd in North Carolina, saying Clinton has more experience than anyone else to be president of the United States. Let's get some more with our political experts.We're here with Gloria Borger. Events like this, the star power, if you will, of Michelle Obama, is that what the Clinton campaign needs right now to prevent complacency?GLORIA BORGER, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: Sure. Absolutely. I mean, let's just say that Michelle Obama gets the surrogate of the year award, because she can bring out the crowds. It was a very big crowd there today. I think the first or second largest of the year.And she not only can get people motivated to vote, but her message today was very clear. She said, they are trying to convince you to stay home, that they are -- their strategy is to make this election so ugly that you won't want any part of it.So she kind of hit the voter suppression issue right on the head, and said to voters, in that important state, which is close, ""You cannot stay home anymore."" And reminded people that, in the year 2008, when her husband won that state, it was by 14,000 votes, which is two per district.So she can really drive that message home. And other surrogates can do the same. If Hillary Clinton doesn't get them enthused, they will try.BLITZER: And David Swerdlick, a new Quinnipiac University poll out today from Quinnipiac in North Carolina. Look at this: Hillary Clinton 47 percent, Donald Trump 43 percent. Gary Johnson, 5 percent. If that poll is accurate, how does Trump catch up?DAVID SWERDLICK, ASSISTANT EDITOR, ""THE WASHINGTON POST"": I think Trump is really just, at this point, going to have to either stay on a couple of messages that seem to resonate for him, like the Obamacare premium numbers, talking about some of the core issues that matter to his voters like immigration.If he gets sidetracked on all the things he gets sidetracked on, I don't see how he makes it up in a national poll. I think he's got to concentrate also on the swing states. The national poll numbers are starting to mean less and less.BLITZER: He was very disciplined today in speeches so far, with another one coming up later in Ohio. Two other intriguing polls in Iowa. Hillary Clinton 44 percent, Trump 44 percent. A month ago, Hillary Clinton was down in Iowa by about seven points.And in Georgia, which is a traditionally red state in a presidential contest, Trump 44, Hillary Clinton 43 percent. She was down seven percent -- seven points a month ago in the same poll in Georgia, as well.It looks like that's a narrowing. If there's a narrowing in Georgia of all places, Trump is in trouble.RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Right, absolutely. I mean, look, we have seen in the national polling sort of a kind of a return to the mean a little bit in the last few days with the numbers coming down more into the range of where they have been for the most of the race. But both of these results, as well as North Carolina and theQuinnipiac, show the limits of that. There are two important points about these polls.First of all, neither of these are states that Hillary Clinton has to win in order to win. They are states that Donald Trump has to win to have any chance, and he is struggling in them.And the other thing that's really significant here, Wolf, is that these are states in each of the two baskets of the swing states. On the one hand, Iowa is probably the Rust Belt swing state where Donald Trump has had the best chance. It's a heavily blue collar, predominantly white state. And again, if the margin has fallen there, Hillary Clinton is ahead in this poll among college whites, it is difficult for him in the other Rust Belt swing states that are less amenable to him.And conversely, Georgia is really outside of the border of what we have thought of in the Sun Belt swing states. You have North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, Nevada and Florida. Georgia is kind of like a step behind. And again, if that is competitive, it kind of tells you where you are in the other states. And in fact, in that Quinnipiac poll, she's up 12 points indeed.[18:35:26] BLITZER: Very interesting numbers, indeed.Olivia Nuzzi, it seems that the Trump campaign strategy now is to somehow decrease voter turnout for Hillary Clinton by raising all these issues, including these WikiLeaks e-mails that have been hacked.NUZZI: I mean, the strategy described in that Bloomberg story by Joshua Green today is like voter depression more than voter suppression. And it seems like they are desperate right now. They know that things aren't going well. As you said, Georgia is in play. Things are not going well in Texas of all places. They are desperate, and they are looking to do anything that they can to change the tide.BLITZER: Can they do that, Gloria?BORGER: See. I mean, we'll have to -- we'll have to see. I was talking to somebody in the Clinton campaign today who was saying, ""Look, they don't expect to win Georgia. They really don't.""But the question of North Carolina is interesting, because will North Carolina start to look more and more like the state of Virginia where they're ahead? Triangle. There are a lot of voters they believe that they can appeal to there. And that is a state that is changing, and so they're very interested, of course, because they want to win it.So they're very interested, of course, because they want to win it -- but they're very interested in the tightening of the polls there, vis- a-vis the state of Virginia, which isn't even -- isn't even endowed anymore.BROWNSTEIN: And Wolf, can I just add real quickly?BLITZER: Yes, go ahead.BROWNSTEIN: ... it's basically the same. In all of the Sun Belt states, you see the same coalition consolidating, accelerating what we've seen over the last 16 years, really, since 2000.In Virginia already, the combination of college-educated whites and minorities have tipped the state toward the Democrats. In the Quinnipiac poll, Hillary Clinton is up double digits among college whites. You combine that with the minority population of Virginia. It's not competitive.In North Carolina in this poll, she's basically even among college whites. And that is enough, given the minority population, to give her a slight advantage.But it puts North Carolina on the same continuum that we've seen in Virginia and Colorado. And if Democrats can sustain that through this election and beyond, it really does tilt the Electoral College map. Georgia and Arizona are one step behind with the same demographic mix. But just not quite as much Democratic strength with college whites yet.BLITZER: All right, guys. Stand by. We have much more coming up. More stolen Clinton campaign e-mails have just been revealed. Should Hillary Clinton ignore them or confront them head on?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[18:47:26] WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Hillary Clinton's campaign brought out one of its biggest stars, the First Lady Michelle Obama. She campaigned with the Democratic nominee today for the first time. Lots going on.Ron Brownstein, another aspect, very interesting, Congressman Jason Chaffetz of Utah, he's a Republican, after the ""Access Hollywood"" video came out, he said there's no way he could support Donald Trump. He rescinded his endorsement, but now, he says he'll actually vote for Donald Trump, even though he's not endorsing him or supporting him.Are Republicans out there sort of over all of the sexual allegations? Are they just ready to move on right now?RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: No. But I think what Congressman Chaffetz has done though shows kind of the incredibly difficult position they are in. Even with a number of Republicans recanting, I believe we are still at a point where more Republican elected officials have said they are not voting for this nominee than any other nominee in the party's history, including Barry Goldwater in 1964 and as I like to say, including even William Howard Taft after Theodore Roosevelt bolted the party in 1912 to start his Bull Moose Party. There are more Republican senators not voting for Trump than went with Roosevelt against Taft.But it reminds the big part of the Republican base is with him. And in fact, if he can -- when Donald Trump gets more generic, less kind of individual, and more like a generic Republican, as he has been in the last few days, he reminds a lot of ordinarily Republican leaning voters, in particular, college white men and non-college white women, where he has been significantly underperforming, he goes out every day and he talks about repealing Obamacare, they go, I'm a Republican, he's a Republican, his numbers start to move up. That's what I think we're seeing in the polls.So, it is a very difficult position for these elected officials. But there is still a bigger fracture in the party over Donald Trump than I believe over any previous nominee.BLITZER: Or when he talks about the Supreme Court and down that line (ph). Go ahead, David.DAVID SWERDLICK, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: One thing, I was just going to say, to me this is a profile in cowardice. The night the ""Access Hollywood"" tape came out, he didn't say ""I'm no longer endorsing Donald Trump,"" he said either ""I'm out"" or ""I'm no longer"", that was words to that effect.BLITZER: You're talking about Jason Chaffetz.SWERDLICK: Yes, talking about Congressman Chaffetz. I mean, he doesn't -- you know, people aren't at this point looking for him to make speeches on behalf of Donald Trump, or fundraiser on behalf of Trump, simply to know what his position is on Donald Trump, to reverse course on this after he gave that speech on TV, on our air, the night of that --BLITZER: Gloria, Utah is a significant state all of a sudden.GLORIA BORGER, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: Oh, very significant state. I mean, who knows who is going to win Utah? Which -- I mean, no Democrat -- no Democrat has won Utah since Barry Goldwater.[18:50:00] So, you look at this and you understand, yes, Jason Chaffetz is in a tough position, but he went on Don Lemon that night, I think you and I were there and they set him out and he can't be back in again. And there is something to say -- look, I don't support him, I'm not going to vote for him, I'm not going to vote for him, but I'm not going to vote for Hillary Clinton.But you have to make that clear or how can your supporters know where your stand?BLITZER: Jason Chaffetz, Olivia, is not alone in this. There are other Republicans who say, I'm not going to endorse him, not going to support him, but I have to vote for him because I don't want Hillary Clinton to be president.OLIVIA NUZZI, THE DAILY BEAST: Right. But this is sort of Trump- vivation (ph) of the American politics, where people realize that they can pretty much get away with flip-flopping, they can get away with changing their minds and it may not matter because people do have short memories and people may not care that much in the end.I mean, if Donald Trump, the nominee, can get away with it, if you're Jason Chaffetz, maybe you think, well, why can't I get away with it, too?BLITZER: Is Melania Trump, you believe, is she going to actually go out and give two or three major speeches over the course of the next 12 days as Donald Trump suggested?BORGER: Well, Donald Trump seemed to surprise her when he said she was going to do it. I think if she does do it, it's going to be an indication that they believe that she can help with women. He has a significant gender gap and that they feel they need her there as a character witness. Spouses always are good character witnesses.The question is whether she's really going to be willing to do that, this campaign has not been something she's enjoyed. She's made it very clear. So, we'll have to see.BLITZER: Very quickly, Ron, would it make a difference?BROWNSTEIN: No, I don't think so. I mean, you know, look, your spouse should like you. And I think that's admirable but it's not really going to make a difference. He's facing some really significant problem with women voters, particularly college-educated white women who is on track to lose by two or three times as much as any Republican ever. And I don't think speeches from the spouse is going to change that.BLITZER: All right. Everybody, stay with me. We're going to continue our analysis.Also, there's other news developing. ISIS plots to attack the United States and that's adding new urgency to a looming military offensive on the terrorists' self-proclaimed capital.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[18:56:51] BLITZER: ISIS plots to attack the United States are believed to be in the works right now in the terrorist self-proclaimed capital in Syria.Our Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr is working the story for us.Barbara, I understand you're learning, getting some new information?BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Indeed, Wolf, because of growing intelligence that ISIS is using Raqqah as a base of operations to plot against the United States. There are fresh indications the U.S. is getting ready to move on Raqqah.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)STARR (voice-over): Inside Raqqah's Syria, the U.S. believes terrorists are plotting to attack the U.S. and the Pentagon is trying to stop it.LT. GEN. STEPHEN TOWNSEND, COMMANDER, COMBINED JOINT TASK FORCE: There is I think a sense of urgency about what we have to do here, because we are just not sure what they're up to and where and when. But we know that this plot/planning is emanating from Raqqah.STARR: CNN has learned that U.S. Special Operations Forces recently attacked an ISIS target inside Syria. The U.S. believes the raid stopped plotters planning to attack the U.S., an administration official says.JOHN KIRBY, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: We know we need to remove Daesh from Raqqah.STARR: There are 2,000 to 3,000 ISIS fighters in and around Raqqah, ISIS' self-declared capital, according to U.S. military officials. No one knows how many other supporters exist among the population.Within the next few weeks, the U.S. plans, along with Kurdish and Arab partners, to try to begin to isolate the city. Local ground forces backed up by U.S. military advisors will be put on roads in and out of Raqqah, trying to stop the flow of ISIS operatives.The U.S. will fly aircraft overhead, ready to strike when targets are identified. The fight for Raqqah will begin even if the fight to retake Mosul in Iraq grows more brutal.CNN producer Tim Lister is in northern Iraq.TIM LISTER, CNN PRODUCER: From the secret phone calls, the text messages, the firsthand accounts of escapees that we're getting, a picture is beginning to emerge. And it's one of increased defensive preparedness by ISIS with booby trapped bombs scattered across the whole neighborhoods, with vehicles suicide bombs being moved to the outskirts but also apparently a preparedness by ISIS to escape.STARR: People trapped in the city are trying to fight ISIS but as many as 600 have been rounded up.LISTER: The risk for anyone caught with a cell phone in Mosul is enormous, summary execution most of the time. But still, they try to get word out to the outside world.(END VIDEOTAPE)STARR: And tonight, U.S. officials are estimating upwards of 900 ISIS operatives have been killed so far in that operation against Mosul, Iraq -- Wolf.BLITZER: Barbara Starr with the latest information at the Pentagon. Barbara, thank you so much for that report.That's it for me. Thanks very much for watching. I'm Wolf Blitzer in THE SITUATION ROOM.""ERIN BURNETT OUTFRONT"" starts right now."	1

House Republicans and the White House cooperated on the Republican initiative, after larger jobs measures stalled.Sponsors said they hoped the bill would lift the low approval ratings of Congress. House Speaker John Boehner said he hoped it would make it easier for small firms to raise investment capital.The West Chester Republican said it would help to encourage job creation in Ohio and elsewhere ""at a time when new business startups are at the lowest levels in 30 years.""Thirty years goes back to the recession of the early 1980s, which would make sense. But PolitiFact Ohio had also seen a recent report that business startups were booming. We asked Boehner's office for more information.They pointed us first to a recent study by the outplacement consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. The study found that the number of unemployed managers and executives starting their own businesses in the second half of 2011 failed to rebound from the record lows recorded over the first half of the year.The study also cited numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that ""it's not just the unemployed who seem turned off -- self-employment in general has decreased significantly during the recession."" The BLS reported there were 8.6 million self-employed Americans in July 2011, compared to almost 10 million in June 2007, prior to the recession.Boehner’s staff additionally referred us to an article in Bloomberg Businessweek reporting that many indicators of startup activity are at record low levels. The per capita rate of formation of firms with employees in 2009, the most recent year tracked by the U.S. Census Bureau, was less than half its 1977 level.Those figures, however, seemed at odds with the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity, a widely cited annual study measuring U.S. business startup activity at the individual owner level. It comes from the nonpartisan Kauffman Foundation, which works to foster entrepreneurial activity.Its latest report, issued March 19, said that the rate of new business creation dipped during 2011, but still remained ""among the highest levels of entrepreneurship over the past 16 years,"" and showed that ""entrepreneurship is alive and well in the wake of the Great Recession.""A previous report of the Kauffman Index said that more Americans had started businesses since the start of the recession than at any period over the previous decade and a half.Wondering how this apparent conflict could be explained, we asked a leading authority on the subject: Scott Shane, chairman of the economics department and professor of entrepreneurial studies at Case Western Reserve University.The numbers do look contradictory, he said, but they measure different things. Using an analogy, ""it's like measuring water in a bathtub.""The Kauffman Index, he said, uses data from the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS) of the Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics to measure the percentage of the adult population, not self-employed, starting a business each month.Using the bathtub analogy, he said, it's like putting a meter on the faucet -- the Kauffman Index measures the water's flow.The Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, meantime, track the number of people who are self-employed, Shane said -- it's like measuring the water level in the tub -- and that number has declined, because of the people who quit self-employment. (Or who, extending the analogy, go down the drain.)But more pertinent to the employment issue addressed by the JOBS Act and Boehner, Shane pointed out that there are two types of businesses: employer firms, which have employees, and non-employers, which do not.Non-employer firms are 80 percent of U.S. businesses, but have much less economic impact, Shane said. Employer firms account for 97 percent of gross domestic product.Using data from the Census Bureau and U.S. Small Business Administration, Shane found that the per capita rate of new employer business formation in 2009 (the most recent year available) was 1.32 per thousand people -- ""an astonishing 51.4 percent of the rate in 1977,"" he said. ""That is, Americans are starting new businesses with employees at half the rate they did 30 years ago.""Not only the rate, but the raw numbers have declined, he said. In 1977, SBA figures show, Americans started 563,325 businesses with employees. In 2009, despite an increase in the population, they started 403,765.And no previous valleys dipped so low. A spreadsheet from Shane shows that neither the rate nor number of startups since 1977 ever hit the most recent level.On the Truth-O-Meter, Boehner's statement that new business startups are at the lowest levels in 30 years gets a rating of True.Advertisement"	0

Huntsman asked.""Possibly,'' said Bill Goetz, a retired, manufacturing executive living in Belmont.Huntsman went on to describe his philosophy and pointed to his record in Utah.""We got a flat tax out of it, we cut income taxes by 30 percent, it was a cost-neutral affair where we took out the deductions, we took out the biases almost completely, some we didn't get out, and you know what? The state came to life in part because of that.''Republicans frequently talk a good game about supporting a flat tax, but they often have difficulty getting political support to change the complicated tax laws. So we wondered if Huntsman and the Utah legislature had succeeded in overhauling the state law to the point where it can be considered a flat tax -- and whether they cut income taxes by 30 percent.The Huntsman campaign pointed us to published reports this spring and in 2007 that explained how Huntsman began pushing for the changes soon after he took office in January 2005.""We need a tax policy that is not only friendly to our citizens, but also creates a competitive environment for business. Business as usual will leave us behind our neighboring states,"" he said during his first State of the State speech in January 2005.Huntsman and the Legislature achieved their goal with two changes in tax law over two years.When Huntsman took office, there were six income tax brackets ranging from 2.3 percent to 7 percent. Ultimately, Huntsman and the Legislature approved a single rate of 5 percent.They created a much flatter tax, stripping away most of the deductions and credits. Utah taxpayers still adjust their income in ways such as counting interest earned on bond income or deducting from income the withdrawals they make from medical savings accounts.The research arm of the Utah Legislature maintains it was not a flat tax in the purest sense. ""Although the new system has a single statutory rate of 5.0 percent, it is not a proportional or 'flat' income tax system. Rather, Utah’s new income tax system remains progressive through tax credits,'' said a January 2010 report of the Utah Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel. (A progressive tax system is one in which richer people pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than poorer people do.)Roughly 90 percent of taxpayers get to claim as a credit from state taxes some of what they claim as deductions and tax exemptions under the federal tax code. The credit phases out and goes away from those making very high incomes in the state.This makes the effective tax rate about 3 percent for Utah taxpayers earning $70,000 a year in 2008 and 4 percent for a household with $100,000 in taxable income, according to the legislative group's analysis.""There's no question this is a single rate tax -- but with the credit, the overwhelming majority of taxpayers do not pay 5 percent of their income,'' said Phil Dean, the policy analyst who authored the 2010 study.Conservative groups give Huntsman high marks for the overhaul and have said they consider it to be a flat tax.The libertarian Cato Institute gave Huntsman the highest score of any governor on tax policy in 2006. Likewise, the Club for Growth praised Huntsman's tax reform while adding there were some ""minor blemishes""' that included other tax increases during his tenure. (It's worth noting that both groups fault Huntsman for increases in state spending that occurred under his watch.)In general, most taxpayers ended up paying less in taxes. The Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel estimated that about 97 percent of taxpayers were paying the same or less compared to the 2005 system.As for Huntsman's claim that they ""cut income taxes by 30 percent,"" we find that is a significant exaggeration.He is close to correct if you compare the statutory rate in the top tax bracketbefore and after the tax system changed. The top rate declined from 7 percent to 5 percent, which is a decrease of 28.6 percent.But there are two problems with this measurement. First, it doesn’t address the lower tax brackets. Remember, the lowest rate went up from 2.3 percent to 5 percent. So Huntsman’s 30 percent decrease in the statutory rate didn’t apply to them.That said, it’s worth noting that residents in the lowest tax brackets didn’t necessarily end up paying more in taxes, because under both approaches they got credits that reduced their tax bill. (In fact, about 97 percent pay the same or less in taxes than they did under the old system.)Which brings us to the second problem with Huntsman’s 30 percent description -- that just looking at the drop in the statutory rate, as Huntsman does, says very little about how a taxpayer actually fared after the change.Even after the imposition of the new system, a Utah resident’s tax bill is heavily dependent on their specific circumstances. The 2010 report found that very few taxpayers saved more than $300 on their tax bill, and those who did were mostly in the top 10 percent of earners.Instead, for the bottom 70 percent of earners, the typical savings was between zero and $200. And a $200 savings for someone earning $55,000 is about four-tenths of 1 percent. That’s a much more modest in-pocket savings than a listener would assume from hearing Huntsman’s 30 percent figure.""In dollars and cents, for single taxpayers the annual income tax cut worked out to between $25 and $100,'' Dean said. ""Most married taxpayers got a tax cut of $50 to $200.""Dean added that a cut in the sales tax effectively doubled the overall tax cut for most families. But even that wouldn’t make the savings approach a 30 percent tax-bill reduction for the vast majority of taxpayers.Our rulingHuntsman said he passed a flat tax and ""cut income taxes by 30 percent.""On the flat tax question, the changes under Huntsman certainly made it a flatter tax than the one it replaced, since the changes he oversaw combined several tax brackets into one. But the tax remains more complicated to calculate than a pure flat tax would be. In fact, Utah’s system of tax credits make the tax somewhat progressive in practice, which is something a true flat tax would not be.Meanwhile, Huntsman’s 30 percent claim is more misleading. It’s true that the statutory rates in the top bracket declined by almost that much, but the actual reduction in tax dollars paid was far smaller for the overwhelming majority of taxpayers -- usually less than 1 percent of a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. We think most people hearing Huntsman's comment would believe he was touting a 30 percent cut in what people actually pay at tax time, and the numbers aren’t close to that. So we rate his claim Mostly False.Advertisement"	0

Seroussi’s study showed a mantle plume pushes 150 milliwatts per square meter of heat up towards the ice sheet. That’s about two to three times the heat flux of regions of the world without volcanic activity.A 2014 University of Texas study found western Antarctica was a literal hotbed for geothermal heat. Researchers concluded that “large areas at the base of Thwaites Glacier are actively melting in response to geothermal flux consistent with rift-associated magma migration and volcanism.”The following year, a team of U.S. scientists confirmed in a study, the large amount of geothermal heat beneath the ice sheet, “The high geothermal heat flux may help to explain why ice streams and subglacial lakes are so abundant and dynamic in this region,” the study found.0	1

Here was the offending tweet:Schilling deleted the tweet after blowback. ESPN released a statement upon suspending Schilling:Curt’s tweet was completely unacceptable, and in no way represents our company’s perspective. We made that point very strongly to Curt and have removed him from his current Little League assignment pending further consideration.The tweet was offensive – to radical Muslims. Factually speaking, there were approximately 6.5 million formal members of the Nazi Party in 1940, out of a total German population of well over 80 million – a little over 8 percent. That number of members did not fully represent the level of support for the Nazi regime in Germany in 1940, of course.The same is true in the radicalized Muslim community. A very small percentage of Muslims globally are formal members of terror groups; it is difficult to estimate precise numbers due to secrecy, although their total membership runs into the hundreds of thousands (the Iranian Revolutionary Guard alone has 120,000 members, and some estimates have placed the ISIS membership at above 200,00).That terrorist membership is the tip of the iceberg: as I have written before, a huge percentage of worldwide Muslims are radicalized. If you calculate the number of Muslims globally who (1) believe that 9/11 was not committed by Muslims; (2) think that shariah law ought to be implemented; (3) support terrorist attacks; or (4) have a positive or neutral attitude toward ISIS, Hamas, Hezbollah, Osama Bin Laden or any other terrorist group or terrorist, the number calculates out to well above 800 million radicalized Muslims.PolitiFact’s ridiculous attempts to counter these calculations – cherry-picking their own, far narrower standard of radicalization — led them to the awkward position that 19 percent of Muslims in various countries, including the West, are radicalized (some 182 million Muslims worldwide).As Schilling wrote, the math is staggering when you get to true numbers.But ESPN has no interest in true numbers, because true numbers are awkward. Unsurprisingly, ESPN refused to explain why Schilling’s tweet was unacceptable. Is it because radicalized Muslims are somehow better than Germans who weren’t formal Nazi Party members? Is it because the genocidal Iranian regime or the barbarians of ISIS are somehow less objectionable than the Nazis themselves?It is worth noting that Schiling did not say that all Muslims should be tarred with the terrorist brush, any more than all Germans should have been tarred with the Nazi brush. The point of his tweet, to anyone with a functioning prefrontal cortex, is obvious: a small, brutal percentage of a larger, partially supportive population can do tremendous harm. That’s inarguable.Fortunately, ESPN doesn’t have to argue with Schilling or anyone else. They simply suspended Schilling, without any real rationale (by way of comparison, they did not suspend frequent ESPN guest Kevin Blackistone for calling the “Star-Spangled Banner” a “war anthem” on their airwaves). And the compliant media breath a sigh of relief, having made the world safer for those offended by tweets – and more ignorant of the threat of radical Islam.Ben Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and The New York Times bestselling author, most recently, of the book, The People vs. Barack Obama : The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).

Gardner Selby on Tuesday, January 8th, 2013 at 10:00 a.m.New Medicaid patients may struggle to land a Texas physician willing to accept that coverage, a medical group suggests.The Texas Medical Association, whose membership includes nearly 46,000 physicians and medical students, said in a Dec. 7, 2012, tweet : ""Only 31% of Texas physicians accept all new #Medicaid patients compared to 67% in 2000.""We soon learned the figures, indicating a possible plummet in patient access, traced to doctor surveys, not government or other records.Some 67 percent of the state’s physicians accepted Medicaid at least once during a recent 12-month period, according to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. Agency spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman told us by email that 34,290 Texas physicians had claims paid by Medicaid in the fiscal year that ran through August 2011. According to the Texas Medical Board, there were nearly 51,000 practicing physicians in the state at about that time.Goodman said she did not have information on the share of physicians not accepting all new Medicaid patients.Brent Annear, a medical association spokesman, guided us to a March 2012 web post by the group stating that 27,917 physicians and medical residents were asked to fill out its online survey and the group fielded 1,139 responses, a 4 percent response rate. The group’s ""preliminary findings"" document says the respondents were a ""representative sample"" of all physicians. The survey reached members and non-members, the association’s Donna Kinney, who oversaw the survey, told us by email.The results: 96 percent of responding physicians said they were generally accepting new patients, but only 31 percent said they accept all new Medicaid patients, compared to 42 percent in the group’s 2010 and 2008 surveys. In another 2012 response, 51 percent said they could take on more privately-insured patients in accord with federal health reform, but not more Medicaid patients.The key question lists physician reimbursement methods including private insurance, Medicare and Medicaid. ""For patients covered by the following payers,"" the question says, ""does your practice currently (1) accept all new patients, (2) limit new patients that you will accept, or (3) accept no new patients?"" In reply, 26 percent said they limit their new Medicaid patients and 44 percent said they decline all new Medicaid patients, compared to 32 percent in 2010.Bexar County physicians were most likely to accept all new Medicaid patients; 47 percent marked that choice. But less than 30 percent of physicians in the counties of Dallas, Tarrant, Harris and Travis, which was at 22 percent, said they accept all new Medicaid patients. In the state’s rural counties, 43 percent said they accept all new Medicaid patients.Annear said by email that physicians have difficulties with Medicaid’s rates and bureaucratic hurdles that delay payments. The rates decreased four times from 2000 to 2011, an association spokeswoman, Pam Udall, said by email, though the state also agreed to a 25-percent boost in funds covering certain physician services provided to children on Medicaid, as part of resolving a lawsuit.We asked Kinney to speculate on why nearly 70 percent of Texas physicians submitted at least one Medicaid claim in a recent year. She said about 60 percent of the state’s physicians--including many specialists in radiology, pathology and anesthesiology--must accept Medicaid to maintain their hospital admitting privileges. Those kinds of doctors would have responded to the survey by saying they limit new Medicaid patients, she said by phone.Wondering if the 2012 results could fairly be compared with the 2000 outcomes, we asked if the question’s wording had changed over the years. Kinney said it had not and also that each sample matches the demographics of physicians statewide--with the exception that fewer surveys are filled out by younger doctors, making for a slight, consistent skew through the years of surveying.For outside perspective, we turned to Florida-based pollster Dave Beattie , who called the survey methodology ""standard,"" and Austin pollster Jeff Smith , who told us by phone that his firm once conducted the survey and that his concern all along has been that in contrast to traditional polls, in which the pollster entirely picks whom to question, respondents to the association survey are self-selected. Results are influenced, he said, by which recipients click through to reply.""This is not a random sample,"" Smith said, adding: ""It’s an imperfect world. You can’t ever have a truly random sample.""Kinney said that because the overall survey covers various topics, there is not much self-selection bias in relation to any one question.For a ""real-world"" take, we ran the 2012 survey result by Austin opthalmologist Michelle Berger, the 2013 president of the Travis County Medical Society, which is affiliated with the medical association.Berger said by phone that the society frequently fields inquiries from individuals newly on Medicaid seeking a doctor. Berger said she stopped accepting new Medicaid patients in her practice because related paperwork proved onerous and government payments, which have not kept up with inflation, were not quickly forthcoming. Then again, she said, doctors who do not accept new Medicaid patients may still provide charity care--the result being that some low-income patients are served even though their doctors do not seek payment.Finally, we circled back to Udall about the group’s tweet not saying that the cited percentages were based only on survey responses. ""It is a fact,"" Udall said by email, since the results reflected a representative sample of physicians.Our rulingThe association’s tweet said 31 percent of physicians accept all new Medicaid patients, compared to 67 percent in 2000. These figures were based on poll responses rather than a harder indicator--and the clarification that they came from a poll was missing from the Twitter post.We rate this claim as Mostly True.Advertisement"	0
http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2010/oct/02/scott-bruun/scott-bruun-says-kurt-schrader-cut-500-billion-med/	"	Says Kurt Schrader voted to cut $500 billion from Medicare, threatening ""thousands of Oregon seniors and their access to their current coverage."""	mostly false	['Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Message Machine 2010']	http://www.oregonlive.com/	http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2009/07/health_care_reform_could_cut_m.html	2010/10/02	"AP/Rick BowmerOregon Sen. Ron Wyden says he will try to protect the state as health care reform plans are developed in the Senate Finance Committee. WASHINGTON -- Oregon has come closer than most states in providing high quality health care at an affordable cost. That makes the state a good match philosophically with the health care revolution brewing in Washington. But Oregon's health care efficiencies work against Oregonians when it comes to the complex and politically-charged Medicare system. If Congress does not make meaningful changes in the government health insurance program for Americans 65 and older, Oregon will remain a place where doctors and hospitals get among the lowest Medicare payments in the nation.How Congress deals with that inequity may affect the benefits Oregonians receive in their Medicare coverage, what they pay for supplemental insurance and whether they can find a doctor.A House reform plan proposes across-the-board cuts in Medicare, and that will be ""very harsh"" on Oregon, said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Senate Finance Committee, which also is producing a health care reform plan. ""I will fight it as hard as I can,"" he said.Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., said he, too, is pushing for an overhaul of how Medicare rates are calculated. But so far, the math isn't going Oregon's way. The health care bill written by House Democrats calls for $500 billion in Medicare cuts over 10 years to help offset the enormous cost of providing care to 45 million uninsured Americans. The Senate is also likely to slice deeply into Medicare to pay for its proposal. Yet a devastating assessment Thursday by Congress' independent budget office concluded that those cuts aren't deep enough. Another $116 billion in Medicare reductions are needed to pay for expanded coverage, the Congressional Budget Office said. That would hurt Oregon, where Medicare spending already is relatively low. In 2006, Medicare reimbursements per member were $6,122 in Oregon compared to $9,564 in New York. That difference means Medicare pays hospitals in some states more than their costs for a hip replacement, heart bypass or other service, while hospitals in Oregon get on average about 90 percent of their costs for services. More cuts to Medicare could mean more Oregon doctors would stop taking Medicare patients. Preliminary results of a statewide survey of all doctors by the Department of Human Services this year show that 31 percent restrict or refuse to take new Medicare patients. ""We would want our elderly and low-income people to get access to primary preventive (doctors), and those are the ones who drop out of the programs when they low-ball their payments,"" said Ellen Pinney, executive director of the Oregon Health Action Campaign. Oregonians with private insurance also pay more when Medicare pays less. With more cuts and no change in Medicare's payment formula, ""hospitals will be forced to increase rates to private insurers, employers, labor trusts and others that purchase hospital services,"" said Kevin Earls, a lobbyist for the Oregon Association of Hospitals and Health Systems. The geographical disparity in Medicare payments grew out of a formula based on the historical costs of hospital services decades ago and has been a source of intense political battling ever since. Since Oregon hospitals have been historically efficient, they get shortchanged by the formula. ""There's less unnecessary or clinically inappropriate care in Oregon than in other states,"" said Bill Kramer, a Portland health care management consultant. ""As a result, Oregon physicians are in a sense penalized for doing the right thing."" Medicare is the nation's biggest health care program, spending $511 billion in 2009 to cover the health needs of 44 million mostly elderly and therefore, medically expensive, Americans. With enormous market power, Medicare influences the price of health care across the entire economy. Congressional lawmakers and the White House agree that squeezing money from Medicare is an essential component for financing care for the uninsured. But the formula for doing that is part of a political tug-of-war. President Obama is calling for major changes in the way Medicare pays providers. ""What we won't be doing is paying you for how many tests you do. We'll be paying you for the quality of outcomes for patients,"" Obama said in an interview with The Oregonian earlier this month. ""We think we can create a more sustainable system, where providers are not susceptible to the whims of Congress that particular year, where these reimbursement rates jump up and down."" Yet the wholesale reform that Oregon needs is not likely to happen because the biggest states with the most political clout, such as New York and Texas, also happen to be where Medicare payments are highest. ""The problem,"" says Rep. David Wu, D-Ore., ""is that half of the lawmakers on Capitol Hill are from states that benefit from the (current system) and half are from states that don't."" Blumenauer was successful Thursday in adding language to the House bill that provides a greater bonus to states like Oregon that provide high quality care at lower cost. But he concedes the bonus is not large enough to cover the overall loss to states like Oregon, Minnesota, Washington and Iowa that get shortchanged by Medicare's formula. One area where Congress is looking for savings is in a managed care version of Medicare called Medicare Advantage, which is provided by private companies and subsidized by the federal government. Seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage pay premiums, but in return have access to more generous coverage than that offered by traditional Medicare. The program is particularly popular in Oregon where 38 percent of Medicare recipients choose it, the largest share in the nation. Cuts to Medicare Advantage would likely mean higher premiums and reductions in procedures covered by the plan, Blumenauer said. Any shift that rewards quality over volume, however, would benefit Oregon, where the health system is already moving in that direction under a health reform plan adopted this spring by the Legislature. With the intense focus on health care, Blumenauer admits he's frustrated there isn't broader support for a solution he says is hiding in plain sight. ""The simple truth is, if the practice patterns in metropolitan Portland were applied nationwide, Americans would get better health care and we wouldn't have a Medicare funding crisis,"" he said. But he's also pragmatic and understands history. ""One person's subsidy is another person's constituent, Blumenauer said. ""When you have somebody who is making huge sums of money on something, they have quite an incentive to keep it the way it is or to spoil it.""-- Charles Pope; OregonianDC@gmail.com-- Bill Graves; billgraves@news.oregonian.com "	0

As a former PTA president and father of two in our Broward County Public Schools, I have a very personal interest in protecting our children and schools.Sunrise is also home to the only public recreational shooting range in Broward County. We welcome, and have enjoyed a positive relationship with, responsible gun owners – those who are interested in recreational and competitive shooting are friends, neighbors, visitors and residents.Last Friday, Sheriff Scott Israel hosted a Roundtable convened by Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz regarding gun violence. Attending were predominantly law enforcement chiefs, but also School Boards of Miami Dade County and Broward, a judge handling mental health issues, a prosecutor handling exclusively gang violence and gun crimes, a former ATF agent, a current FDLE agent, and the Mayors of Miami-Dade County and Broward County.In talking to responsible gun owners, law enforcement and residents, there is an evolving consensus: We must take whatever reasonable steps we can to prevent guns being placed in the hands of the irresponsible, derangedand criminals.This is not simply a reaction to a single event or a series of sensational events. In America, each day, there are 33 murders committed with guns.There is no single solution. That does not mean we should do nothing. We should have: School Resource Officers to play an important role in protecting our children and teachers – not as armed guards, but as part of the community-policing model meant to understand the dynamics of students and families and how they interact in and out of our schools. In addition to deterrence, they help address problems of drugs, gangs, and issues facing our neighborhoods and at-risk youth. In Sunrise, SROs have been or are active members of SWAT, Field Force, Hostage Negotiators and other specialized units – while still being able to open the milk carton for a frustrated 1stgrader or help a parent navigate the car loop.Universal background checks on ALL sales, with meaningful enforcement and real penalties for violators.Background checks that are meaningful.Full prosecution of anyone breaking existing laws.Severely increase penalties for crimes committed with guns.Ways to address the mentally ill and those with mental health issues. Now someone committed involuntarily for 72 hours under the “Baker Act” (as a danger to themselves or others) will have their guns returned to them by the police automatically and immediately upon discharge after 72 hours AND their commitment is never entered into a background check database. As a result, there is also no impediment or second thought given to someone being released and purchasing a gun.Penalties for the possession of a firearm obtained without a background check. If you shouldn’t have the gun, responsible gun owners say throw away the key. How we get there is part of the discussion.Roughly 6.6 million guns-a-year are transferred without background checks, many through the internet. Right now, private sellers exclusively decide whether or not they should seek a background check. That is unworkable and an illogical step to curb the flow of guns into the hands of the irresponsible, deranged and criminals.A March shooting rampage in New Mexico occurred after someone who would never have been able to pass a background check purchased guns privately, through an ad in the paper. The seller later admitted how badly he felt. The same scenario happened in a Wisconsin mass shooting last year involving an act of domestic violence. How many other times a day does this happen?We must make sure databases are populated with the right information on domestic violence history, convictions, mental health issues AND the state databases are linked to federal databases.Databases do prevent “bad guys” from getting guns. In 2009, over 150,000 were prohibited from purchasing. Since 1999, 1.7 million have been prohibited from buying guns from federally licensed dealers.But, gaps have let felons, those with domestic violence convictions and restraining orders and the mentally ill to actually obtain guns and permits to carry a concealed firearm.At Virginia Tech, the mass shooting was committed by someone who passed a background check even though a judge had found him mentally ill and ordered he not be permitted to purchase or possess a gun. The information was never linked to the necessary databases. How many times a day does this happen?All this means increased resources for enforcement and prosecutions, as well as a change in law to make the penalties severe enough that criminals, unscrupulous dealers, law enforcement and federal prosecutors take this seriously.The raging national debate over “bans” and restrictions on the character of guns and magazines are more difficult. Licensed dealers and law enforcement tell me since the Sandy Hook mass shooting, you cannot even find certain “military style” weapons to purchase…or the prices have skyrocketed.It is true so many of the murders committed each day involve weapons not even contemplated by any proposed “ban” or not involving high capacity magazines. So, some solutions should be implemented without even tackling the thorny issues presented.However, many in law enforcement said limiting high capacity magazines would make a difference over time regarding dangers they face and in many of these shootings. Mark Kelly emphasized this point last week in an interview; his wife Gabrielle Giffords was shot when the killer was stopped as he attempted to reload after emptying 30 rounds from a magazine. Sure, they can just reload. But, for the untrained particularly, reloading is a point where intervention can occur or where mechanical failure can impede. Some question why any civilian needs 30 round or more capacity.We must take the steps we all agree will make a difference. Doing nothing is not an option. Becoming paralyzed by politics will cost lives. Mike Ryan, the mayor of Sunrise, is also Chair of the Broward League of Cities Public Safety Committee and the Co-Chair of the Joint SRO Taskforce of the Broward League of Cities. 	1

His opponents, including Ron Paul, Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry, cast him as a lobbyist in everything but name who landed over $1.6 million in fees from the one of the biggest players in the home mortgage industry.Gingrich states flatly he never lobbied on behalf of Freddie Mac, but in the last debate before the Iowa caucuses, Gingrich had to explain another wrinkle in his past dealings with Freddie. One of the panelists asked him about his words from 2007 ""I like the GSE, or government sponsored enterprise like Freddie Mac, model.""Gingrich took the broad view to defend his position, saying ""when you look for example at electric membership co-ops, and you look at credit unions, there are a lot of government sponsored enterprises that are awfully important and do an awfully good job.""So we ask, was that a fair comparison? Are electric co-ops and credit unions the same as government sponsored enterprises, GSE’s, like Freddie Mac?There is one similarity between a GSE and a credit union or an electric co-op. Neither pays federal or state income taxes. But Patrick Lavigne, spokesman for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA), said GSE ""is not a term that I’ve heard applied to electric coops before.""Nor, as we learned, would he be likely to. The term GSE applies to just a handful of very particular institutions. It takes a specific act of congress to create one, usually to ease the flow of money to a certain industry, like housing or agriculture. Glossaries like Investopedia define GSE’s as ""(p)rivately held corporations with public purposes created by the U.S. Congress to reduce the cost of capital for certain borrowing sectors of the economy.""When the White House submits its annual budget, it includes the GSE’s, and the list isn’t long. There are the Agricultural Credit Bank and Farm Credit Banks, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation. And that’s it. No electric co-ops.No credit unions.The 2012 White House budget explains that Congress chartered Freddie Mac in 1970 to facilitate ""the flow of investment dollars from the capital markets to mortgage lenders and ultimately, to homebuyers.""A credit union or an electric co-op is born completely differently. They come into being only when a group of local investors pool their money.The country’s very first credit union was started in 1908 by a priest in Manchester, N.H., to provide credit to the factory workers in the textile mills. Washington played no role at all.Later, the federal government offered both funding assistance and regulatory guidelines. Local groups need to apply to a government agency for recognition as a nonprofit, member-owed entity. By the way, that’s another difference. Freddie Mac is owned by stockholders. Co-ops are owned by their members, the people who use them. Levine, with the NRECA, says electric co-ops started in the 1930’s when ""farmers would each throw $5 dollars into the hat and then ask Washington for a loan for a transformer or some power lines.""Back then, and today, those loans would come with a very low interest rate but a GSE such as Freddie Mac was treated even more favorably. It was formed with a direct line of credit into the federal Treasury -- upwards of $2 billion. ""They could borrow money cheaper than anyone except Uncle Sam himself,"" said Kathleen Day, a former Washington Post reporter who covered the GSE’s for over two decades.The deal for Freddie Mac got even better. Thanks to that intimate association with the federal government, Day says ""the markets perceived them as something that was backed by Washington and invested at a very low cost ... That’s what allowed it to grow.""We asked the Gingrich campaign to send us any source that describes a credit union or a electric co-op as a GSE. We did not hear back.John Berlau, a policy director with the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a think tank that supports limited government and free markets, says he knows of no such description. In an email, he wrote ""credit union officials I have talked to are fearful that Gingrich's false claim that they are a type of GSE may unjustly harm their image among the public and legislators.""Our Ruling:Gingrich spoke of credit unions and electric cooperatives as if they were the same sort of entities as Freddie Mac. We find no support for that and find major differences in how they are created and operate compared with GSEs. Congress created Freddie Mac, as it does every GSE, by passing a specific law to bring it into being. Freddie Mac has stockholders and a direct line of credit with the U.S. Treasury. The term, Government Sponsored Enterprise, applies only to a handful of financial entities listed in the federal budget.None of those characteristics apply to credit unions and electric cooperatives.Gingrich was paid by Freddie Mac to provide strategic advice, so he should be familiar with government sponsored entities and know what is and isn’t a GSE. But Gingrich got it wrong twice during the debate in Iowa.We rule his claim Pants on Fire.Advertisement"	0

(Getty)Paul Manafort , the adviser hired by Donald Trump to add stability and institutional know-how to Trump’s often scattershot presidential campaign, has long and deep reported ties to pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. PolitiFact, as part of an exchange of journalists sponsored by the U.S. State Department, is hosting two foreign political journalists, including a reporter from Ukraine. We asked that reporter to analyze Manafort’s connections to Ukraine and its political leadership. What follows is her report. ""We joke in Ukraine that it is a bad sign for Trump that he hired Manafort. Because his client Yanukovych was ousted and fled to Russia, to the city of Rostov. So Trump could also end up in Rostov. It is almost like an anecdote."" -- Ukrainian political expert Oleg KravchenkoManafort’s entry into Ukrainian politicsUkrainian political experts say Manafort, 67, was first hired to work in Ukraine more than a decade ago by the country’s wealthiest businessman, Rinat Akhmetov . Akhmetov, (right), a steel and iron ore magnate, is worth an estimated $2.8 billion, according to Forbes .Officially, Manafort advised Akhmetov in 2005 on a corporate communication strategy for one of his companies, System Capital Management .Akhmetov, however, also was a supporter of Viktor Yanukovych, the country’s prime minister, a leader of the Party of Regions and an ally of Vladimir Putin. Yanukovych became president in 2010, but fled under escort to Russia after Ukraine’s 2014 revolution.Akhmetov told journalists that Manafort was recommended to him by an American law firm. According to information from Mustafa Nayyem, a former Ukrainian journalist and currently a member of parliament, Manafort was a protege of Oleg Deripaska , a Russian businessman with an estimated net worth of $3.5 billion.Manafort’s work for Viktor YanukovychExperts say Manafort was unofficially invited to consult on Yanukovych’s first presidential campaign in December 2004, in the days of the Orange Revolution in Ukraine.Yanukovych, (left), was competing with pro-Western opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko, who was poisoned by dioxin during the campaign.Once Yanukovych was announced as a winner, massive protests exploded. Eventually the results of the original runoff were invalidated and a re-vote was ordered.As sources in Yanukovych’s circle claimed , Manafort was asked to ""save"" Yanukovych’s campaign and improve his image just two weeks before the new vote.However, the American strategist said it was too late to change the situation. Yanukovych failed. Manafort then was hired for the 2006 parliamentary elections campaign to help Yanukovych’s Party of Regions. According to Mustafa Nayyem, Yanukovych and Manafort first met one-to-one in the Czech resort town of Karlovy Vary.The meeting was arranged by Akhmetov, who wanted Yanukovych to work with an American to repair his image as opposed to Gleb Pavlovsky, a Russian who advised Putin until 2011.Akhmetov’s camp insisted on a partnership with American consultants. Other parts of Yanukovych’s team preferred the idea of collaborating with the Russians.Akhmetov won out.""It was advantageous for the defeated Yanukovych’s team to find a guilty one,"" Pavlovsky told PolitiFact.The relationship lasted for years leading up to Yanukovych’s 2010 presidential campaign. Manafort made Yanukovych look more respectable, working with stylists and consultants to redesign his image.The political consultant had another important mission -- to move Yanukovych closer to Washington. Yanukovych’s team wanted a photo of President Barack Obama with Yanukovych to show that Ukraine’s president was respected in the West.Yanukovych and Obama in April 2010 in Washington, D.C. (Getty)""It was a weird thing for the people in Ukraine, because they could not imagine how an American strategist agreed to cooperate with Putin’s friend. It was confusing. But Manafort played a decisive role in the victory of Yanukovych,"" Ukrainian political expert Oleg Kravchenko told us.Manafort’s work for Yanukovych and the Party of Regions was kept out of the media as Ukrainian politicians feared of accusations of meddling by the United States. They signed confidentiality agreements to protect the arrangement, and Manafort would not comment on his cooperation with Ukrainian politicians. He refused interviews from Ukrainian journalists, saying he was not a public figure. It’s unclear if Manafort speaks Ukrainian or Russian, but reporters would spot him at the posh InterContinental Kyiv hotel.The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment for this story, and the phone number listed for Manafort’s lobbying office has been disconnected.In an April 24, 2016, interview on Fox News Sunday , Manafort described his role in Ukraine as helping align Yanukovych and his administration with Western interests.""The role that I played in that administration was to help bring Ukraine into Europe, and we did,"" Manafort said. ""We succeeded."" Manafort worked in Ukraine under the umbrella of his lobbying firm, Davis Manafort & Freeman, Inc. Manafort worked with a group of American political advisers in Ukraine, including expat Philip Griffin , top John McCain adviser Richard H. Davis, and former Ronald Reagan advance man Rick Ahearn.Manafort at a Donald Trump event on April 27, 2016. (Getty)""I am not here just for the election,"" Manafort said in 2007 in Ukraine. ""I am trying to play a constructive role in developing a democracy. I am helping to build a political party.""It is unclear how much money Manafort earned while working in Ukraine because campaign payments are not public information. Mustafa Nayyem, the Ukrainian member of parliament, says the American strategist could have made anywhere from $2 million to $20 million during the 2006 parliamentary campaigns alone.However, according to a 2008 U.S. Justice Department annual report, Manafort’s company received just $63,750 from Yanukovych's Party of Regions over a six-month period ending on March 31, 2008, for consulting services.Ukrainian political analyst Igor Kushnir said it’s not unique for Manafort to work with a variety of politicians who hold different alliances.""It is not strange that spin doctors work for the different political camps. For example, Manafort used to advise Ferdinand E. Marcos , the former Philippine dictator. Before that he coordinated Ronald Reagan’s presidential campaign. The same story with all spin doctors. It is their job to consult all kind of politicians,"" Kushnir said.Klitschko connectionSome Ukrainians believe Manafort remains active in local politics. After Yanukovych fled Ukraine in 2014, Manafort reportedly continued to work with Serhiy Lyovochkin, a former head of the Presidential Administration of Ukraine for Yanukovych. He also still cooperates with the remnants of the Party of Regions, now called the Opposition Block, according to some reports.Others believe Manafort’s role in national elections ended in 2014.But journalists reported that Manafort advised the 2015 election campaign of Vitali Klitschko, the former professional boxer who was running for mayor of Kiev.Klitschko wore a new Ukrainian police cap (which resembles an American one) on a presentation of the new police. It was the advice of the American consultant, journalists reported. Klitschko’s press officer denies the arrangement.

In Texas, unlike some other states and unlike some other leaders, we are committed to cracking down on voter fraud.”In an interview with the Texas Tribune CEO and Editor-in-Chief Evan Smith on Friday, Obama said that leaders in Texas are partly to blame for low voter turnout in the state.“The folks who are governing the good state of Texas aren't interested in having more people participate,” Obama said.Obama has been previously critical of Voter ID laws like the one Texas passed in 2011. A federal judge ruled last year that the Texas law had a “discriminatory effect” by restricting access to the polls for black and Hispanic Texans. Last week the full U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals announced that it would hear arguments over whether the law violates the Voting Rights Act. The law requires most citizens to show one of a handful of forms of allowable photo identification before their election ballots can be counted.One specific policy that Obama suggested the state should adopt to increase turnout would be online voter registration. But Abbott appeared uninterested in the proposal when asked about it at a press conference following the announcement that California-based Pegasus Foods is building a new, 80,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Rockwall, Texas.“We don’t want to open the system up to methodologies or ways of voting that would promote or allow voter fraud,” Abbott said. “To the contrary to the president’s comment, the fact is — despite our voter registration laws — we had the highest level of turnout than ever before in the primary that occurred just a few weeks before he made that comment.”While Texas did witness historic voter turnout in the 2016 primaries, the state still had one of the lowest voting-age participation rates of the states that have held primaries so far at 21.5 percent, besting only Louisiana as of last week. But Abbott did not attribute those figures to the state’s election laws, instead pointing to the lack of faith in government among voters.“Voters and citizens repeatedly say, ‘Why go vote if we’re going to have corrupt leaders in office?’” Abbott said. “So we need to root out and eliminate corrupt leaders and root out and eliminate corruption in the voting process, and that means greater ballot security, not less ballot security.”Abbott noted that he personally prosecuted voter fraud cases “across the entire state of Texas” while he was the state's attorney general from 2002 to 2015.As U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, pointed out last year in light of the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act,Voter fraud remains by many accounts a rare phenomenon in Texas.“You're more likely to get struck by lightning in Texas than to find any kind of voter fraud,”U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, said last year, an assertion that PolitiFact found to be true. As of last year, there had been a total of 85 election fraud prosecutions resolved in Texas, including 51 guilty or no contest pleas and 9 convictions, according to PolitiFact. Lorraine Minnite, a Rutgers professor and author of the book The Myth of Voter Fraud, determined that four cases in Texas from 2000 to 2014 involved in-person voter fraud.Tags: 	1

Michele Bachmann charged that former House Speaker Newt Gingrich supported an individual health care mandate in 1993 and 2011. Is she right?During a Republican presidential debate on Dec. 10, 2011, in Des Moines, Iowa, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., took aim at one of her rivals, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, for his past support for an individual mandate for health insurance -- the government requirement for individuals to buy health insurance. It’s a central provision at issue in the legal challenges to President Barack Obama’s health care law.In 1993, Bachmann said, Gingrich ""first advocated for the individual mandate in health care. And as recently as May of this year, he was still advocating for the individual mandate in health care.""Readers asked us to check the claim, so we did.Gingrich appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press on Oct. 3, 1993, at a time when the Clinton administration was trying to pass a health-care overhaul. On the May 15, 2011, edition of Meet the Press , host David Gregory replayed a clip from Gingrich’s 1993 appearance that addressed the individual mandate.""I am for people, individuals -- exactly like automobile insurance -- individuals having health insurance and being required to have health insurance. And I am prepared to vote for a voucher system which will give individuals, on a sliding scale, a government subsidy so we insure that everyone as individuals have health insurance.""That seems pretty clear, but we wanted to locate further context to make sure. We couldn’t locate the full transcript, but we did find a partial transcript excerpted in a Washington Times report:Q: Do you support compulsory national health care?A: Not at all. ... (The president's plan) is a monstrosity. I mean, after all the nice speeches, after all the nice testimony, the fact is, when you read the president's plan, it has got to be the most destructively big-government plan ever proposed. … That's how he gets the money -- by coercing change in order to pay for his plan. Without coercion, this plan collapses, and with coercion, it, frankly, is a remarkable bill to be offered to an American nation.Q: Are you for compulsory automobile insurance?A: I would like to see us go much closer to (Texas Republican Sen.) Phil Gramm's model. I would like to see every American have health insurance. I am willing to require that. I'd much rather do it through an individual voucher, much like an earned-income tax credit, rather than do it through an employer mandate that will kill jobs. But that's not the issue here. You can pass a requirement, and you can find a way to give what is actually less than 8 percent of the American people health insurance without having to go to the total overhaul of American health care, turning it all into a giant bureaucratic mess with a centralized board in Washington appointed by politicians.The full context makes Gingrich seem somewhat more flexible about the details, but ultimately he did say, ""I would like to see every American have health insurance. I am willing to require that.""What about the claim that Gingrich was advocating for the individual mandate as recently as May 2011 -- a point well after virtually all mainstream Republicans had come out against such a requirement?Here, too, the venue was Meet the Press, the May 15, 2011 edition . After Gregory played the 1993 clip, here’s the conversation:Gregory: ""What you advocate there is precisely what President Obama did with his health care legislation, is it not?""Ginrgich: ""No, it's not precisely what he did. In, in the first place, Obama basically is trying to replace the entire insurance system, creating state exchanges, building a Washington - based model, creating a federal system. I believe all of us -- and this is going to be a big debate -- I believe all of us have a responsibility to help pay for health care . I think the idea that...""Gregory: ""You agree with Mitt Romney on this point.""Gingrich: ""Well, I agree that all of us have a responsibility to pay -- help pay for health care . And, and I think that there are ways to do it that make most libertarians relatively happy. I've said consistently we ought to have some requirement that you either have health insurance or you post a bond....""Gregory: ""Mm-hmm.""Gingrich: ""...or in some way you indicate you’ll be held accountable.""Gregory: ""But that is the individual mandate, is it not?""Gingrich: ""It's a variation on it.""Gregory: ""OK.""Gingrich: ""But it's a system …""Gregory: ""And so you won't use that issue against Mitt Romney.""Gingrich: ""No. But it's a system which allows people to have a range of choices which are designed by the economy. But I think setting the precedent -- you know, there are an amazing number of people who think that they ought to be given health care. And, and so a large number of the uninsured earn $75,000 or more a year, don't buy any health insurance because they want to buy a second house or a better car or go on vacation. And then you and I and everybody else ends up picking up for them. I don't think having a free rider system in health is any more appropriate than having a free rider system in any other part of our society.""This exchange became so controversial in Republican circles that Gingrich felt the need to personally walk back his comment the following day.""I am completely opposed to the Obamacare mandate on individuals,"" he said in a video . ""I fought it for two and half years at the Center for Health Transformation. You can see all the things we did to stop it at HealthTransformation.net . I am for the repeal of Obamacare and I am against any effort to impose a federal mandate on anyone because it is fundamentally wrong and I believe unconstitutional.""We understand Gingrich’s desire to restate his opposition to the individual mandate, given how deeply opposed Republican voters are to the idea. But was what Gingrich said in the 2011 Meet the Press interview really ""advocating for the individual mandate in health care,"" as Bachmann said in the Des Moines debate?Not quite.Gingrich calls it a ""variation"" on the individual mandate -- the idea that people take responsibility for their health care, either by purchasing health insurance or by posting a bond to pay for any health care they may eventually need.It’s not the first time Gingrich advocated a choice between a mandate and a bond. For instance, in a June 25, 2007, column titled, ""Covering the uninsured -- do we want markets or mandates?"" Gingrich wrote, ""In order to make coverage more accessible, Congress must do more, including passing legislation to … require anyone who earns more than $50,000 a year to purchase health insurance or post a bond.""Working out the details of a bond system -- such as how much would need to be set aside and how -- poses challenges. But it’s conceivable that the legal challenges to Obama’s health care law, which are based on the notion that the government cannot compel Americans to buy a commercial product, might be less likely to succeed if the law had offered the bond option.""A bond alternative was part of the Heritage Foundation's plan and was actually originally in Romney's proposal in Massachusetts but was taken out by legislature late in game,"" said Michael Tanner, a health policy specialist with the libertarian Cato Institute. ""It is a modest improvement over a straight mandate since it doesn't require you to buy a specific product, but libertarians like me still found it objectionable.""Still, in our view, the fact that Gingrich supported the bond idea in the 2011 Meet the Press interview muddies the waters enough to weaken the argument Bachmann made -- that ""as recently as May of this year, he was still advocating for the individual mandate in health care.""Our rulingIn the 1993 interview, Gingrich advocated for individuals ""being required to have health insurance,"" though he expressed flexibility on the details. That makes the first half of Bachmann’s claim correct. In the 2011 interview, Gingrich said ""we ought to have some requirement that you either have health insurance or you post a bond."" It’s an exaggeration to say that this equates to advocating for an individual mandate, since he posed it as one of two acceptable options. On balance, we rate Bachmann’s statement Mostly True. Advertisement"	0

http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2010/sep/15/republican-governors-association/barnes-and-obama-sorry-gop-says/	"	Roy Barnes is like Barack Obama because they're both doing a lot of apologizing."	half-true	['Message Machine 2010']	http://www.politifact.com/	http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/15/mitt-romney/obama-remarks-never-true-apology/	2010/09/15	"Several times, Obama ""has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally ... .""— Mitt Romney on Tuesday, March 2nd, 2010 in his book ""No Apology.""Obama's remarks never a true 'apology'By Angie Drobnic Holan on Monday, March 15th, 2010 at 9:58 a.m.Mitt Romney's new book is called No Apology. The first chapter makes it clear who he thinks is apologizing: President Barack Obama.""Never before in American history has its president gone before so many foreign audiences to apologize for so many American misdeeds, both real and imagined,"" Romney writes. ""It is his way of signaling to foreign countries and foreign leaders that their dislike for America is something he understands and that is, at least in part, understandable. There are anti-American fires burning all across the globe; President Obama's words are like kindling to them.""Obama might give compliments to America here and there, Romney adds. ""But what makes his speeches jump out at his audience are the steady stream of criticisms, put-downs, and jabs directed at the nation he was elected to represent and defend.""In his first nine months in office, President Obama has issued apologies and criticisms of America in speeches in France, England, Turkey, and Cairo; at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and the United Nations in New York City. He has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally, and for acting without regard for others; for treating other countries as mere proxies, for unjustly interfering in the internal affairs of other nations, and for feeding anti-Mulism sentiments; for committing torture, for dragging our feet on global warming and for selectively promoting democracy.""As we did our research, we noticed that the idea that Obama has traveled the world apologizing is popular among some conservative Web sites. The Heritage Foundation, for example, published an analysis in June 2009 called ""Barack Obama's Top 10 Apologies."" Similar compilations are available elsewhere, and radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh has mentioned Obama apologizing several times.But as we looked over Obama's remarks, we noticed that he never used the word that is the universal hallmark of apologies: ""sorry."" Merriam-Webster defines an apology as ""an admission of error or discourtesy accompanied by an expression of regret."" If someone is apologizing, it seems that is a discrete act that can be verified and fact-checked. We set out to discover how accurate Romney was in describing Obama as constantly apologizing.What Obama saidWe read the seven Obama speeches and selected the passages that seemed the most critical, apologetic or conciliatory, and then ran them by several experts with different points of view. Because of their length, we've compiled those passages into a separate document with links to the full remarks , and we encourage you to click over and read those remarks now.To summarize them here, the remarks include major speeches, press conferences, and remarks at a town hall meeting. At times, Obama uses an on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand formulation that he is tends to employ right before he asks the two sides to come together.At a town hall meeting in France , for example, Obama encouraged Europe to work with the United States, and admitted that the United States ""has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive."" But he immediately said that Europe has been guilty of a ""casual"" and ""insidious"" anti-Americanism. ""On both sides of the Atlantic, these attitudes have become all too common. They are not wise. They do not represent the truth. They threaten to widen the divide across the Atlantic and leave us both more isolated,"" Obama concluded. And at a major address to the United Nations , Obama said, ""I took office at a time when many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and distrust. Part of this was due to misperceptions and misinformation about my country. Part of this was due to opposition to specific policies, and a belief that on certain critical issues, America has acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others. And this has fed an almost reflexive anti-Americanism, which too often has served as an excuse for collective inaction.""At other times, Obama doesn't seem so much to be criticizing the United States as he is criticizing the foreign policy stances of the Bush administration. In England, a reporter said that during the 2008 campaign, Obama had said that the power and authority of the United States had diminished in recent years. Obama was quick to turn the question toward the Bush team . ""Well, first of all, during the campaign I did not say that some of that loss of authority was inevitable,"" Obama said. ""I said it was traced to very specific decisions that the previous administration had made that I believed had lowered our standing in the world.... I would like to think that with my election and the early decisions that we've made, that you're starting to see some restoration of America's standing in the world.""At a speech in Cairo on relations between the U.S. and the Islamic world, Obama got very close to regretting decades-old U.S. actions in Iran. But then he immediately countered with criticism of Iran. He did not make a formal expression of regret, but suggested both countries simply ""move forward."" Here are his exact remarks: ""In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government. Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians. This history is well known. Rather than remain trapped in the past, I've made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward.""Looking at all the remarks Romney cited, we noticed that Obama is most conciliatory when discussing torture and detention at the U.S. military installation at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Obama mentioned this in four separate instances that Romney cited in the fact we're checking. Typically, Obama would say that the U.S. must always stay true to its ideals, and that's why Obama ""unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year."" (He has not been successful with his order of closing Guantanamo; it remains open as of this writing.)Obama's most pointed remarks on Guantanamo were at the National Archives, in a major speech on fighting terrorism . Obama said that after 9/11, ""our government made a series of hasty decisions. I believe that many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people. But I also believe that all too often our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight; that all too often our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions."" He also said that the Guantanamo prison ""likely created more terrorists around the world than it ever detained. So the record is clear: Rather than keeping us safer, the prison at Guantanamo has weakened American national security. It is a rallying cry for our enemies.""Did Obama apologize?We sent Obama's remarks to several different experts on foreign policy and apologies, to see if they thought Obama was apologizing.• Nile Gardiner, a foreign policy analyst with the the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Obama is definitely apologizing, and it's not good. He co-wrote the Heritage analysis, "" Barack Obama's Top 10 Apologies: How the President Has Humiliated a Superpower .""""Apologizing for your own country projects an image of weakness before both allies and enemies,"" Gardiner said. ""It sends a very clear signal that the U.S. is to blame for some major developments on the world stage. This can be used to the advanage of those who wish to undermine American global leadership.""He noted that Obama tends to be most apologetic about how the U.S. has fought terrorism and its approach to the Iraq war. ""There is a very strong partisan element to his apologies, but the biggest driving factor is Obama's personal belief that the U.S. is not an exceptional, uniquely great nation,"" he said.• John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studies presidential rhetoric and political language. He said Obama is using conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing.""It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity,"" Murphy said. ""Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology. ... In rhetorical history, an apology is generally considered an account of some kind of bad behavior in which you are going to take responsibility and express regret.""Romney's criticisms of Obama are part of a conservative tradition that emphasizes steadfastness in foreign policy, particularly in the wake of the Vietnam War. ""There's long been a strain of conservative rhetoric that argues that what matters most for the United States in the world is our will,"" Murphy said. ""The difficulty with that was shown in the second Bush administration, when will power is not quite enough. In Iraq, for example, you have to have a battle plan that makes sense and understand the situation you're going into'' and have enough resources to do that.• Lauren Bloom, an attorney and business consultant, wrote the book, The Art of the Apology, advising businesses and individuals on when to apologize and how to do it.She said Obama's words fall short of an apology, mostly because he didn't use the words ""sorry"" or ""regret."" ""I think to make an effective apology, the words 'I'm sorry' or 'we're sorry' always have to be there,"" Bloom said.Obama's remarks are really non-apologies, and they're not good in business or personal relationships, Bloom said. The one area where they can be useful: international diplomacy.""Gov. Romney is trying to appeal to the inner John Wayne of his readers, and that has a certain emotional appeal,"" Bloom said. ""For the rest of us, a level assessment of less-than-perfect human behavior is perfectly reasonable.""• Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann, a professor who studies international human rights, maintains the Web site Political Apologies and Reparations , a database of documents on apologies. Many of the apologies in the database relate to genocide or slavery.""To say the United States will not torture is not an apology, it is a statement of intent,"" Howard-Hassman said. ""A complete apology has to acknowledge something was wrong, accept responsibility, express sorrow or regret and promise not to repeat it.""Obama's Cairo address in particular was a means of reaching out to the Islamic world, not an acknowledgement of wrongdoing, she said.""Whether he's apologizing or not, he's saying 'I respect your society and I respect your customs.' Maybe that's what Romney considers an apology, that gesture of respect,"" she said. ""But a gesture of respect is not an apology.""Other presidential apologiesShort of conducting a full review of all American presidents to see if any others had ever apologized, we decided to narrow our focus and look at Obama's two immediate predecessors, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.Several sources we reviewed discussed Clinton's remarks about the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, and described them as an apology. But Clinton did not explicitly apologize, and he assigned responsibility to the international community, not just the United States. ""The international community, together with nations in Africa, must bear its share of responsibility for this tragedy as well,"" Clinton said in Rwanda in 1998. ""We did not act quickly enough after the killing began. We should not have allowed the refugee camps to become safe haven for the killers. We did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name: genocide. We cannot change the past. But we can and must do everything in our power to help you build a future without fear, and full of hope.""Clinton did apologize, forcefully, to the survivors and families of the experiments conducted in Tuskegee, Ala. , in which government doctors left sick men untreated as part of a research study on syphilis. ""The United States government did something that was wrong -- deeply, profoundly, morally wrong,"" Clinton said at a formal ceremony in 1997. ""To the survivors, to the wives and family members, the children and the grandchildren, I say what you know: No power on Earth can give you back the lives lost, the pain suffered, the years of internal torment and anguish. What was done cannot be undone. But we can end the silence. We can stop turning our heads away. We can look at you in the eye and finally say on behalf of the American people, what the United States government did was shameful, and I am sorry.""Bush made remarks in 2002 about American slavery, which some people construed as an apology, at Goree Island, Senegal . But Bush did not formally apologize or express regret, instead opting to praise the Americans in history who worked to end slavery. ""My nation's journey toward justice has not been easy and it is not over,"" he said. ""The racial bigotry fed by slavery did not end with slavery or with segregation. And many of the issues that still trouble America have roots in the bitter experience of other times. But however long the journey, our destination is set: liberty and justice for all.""Bush did, however, specifically apologize to King Abdullah of Jordan for the abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. The 2004 apology took place privately, but Bush and Abdullah spoke soon after at a Rose Garden press conference. ""We also talked about what has been on the TV screens recently, not only in our own country, but overseas -- the images of cruelty and humiliation. I told His Majesty as plainly as I could that the wrongdoers will be brought to justice, and that the actions of those folks in Iraq do not represent the values of the United States of America,"" Bush said. ""I told him I was sorry for the humiliation suffered by the Iraqi prisoners, and the humiliation suffered by their families. I told him I was equally sorry that people who have been seeing those pictures didn't understand the true nature and heart of America.""Obama's praise and motivationsWhile Obama has admitted mistakes, he has also praised America. Romney acknowledges as much when he writes that Obama ""always the skillful politician, will throw in compliments about America here and there.""In Cairo, Obama called the United States ""one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known. ... We were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal, and we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words -- within our borders, and around the world."" At the Langley speech, Obama told the CIA staff, ""What makes the United States special, and what makes you special, is precisely the fact that we are willing to uphold our values and our ideals even when it's hard, not just when it's easy; even when we are afraid and under threat, not just when it's expedient to do so. That's what makes us different. So, yes, you've got a harder job. And so do I. And that's okay, because that's why we can take such extraordinary pride in being Americans. And over the long term, that is why I believe we will defeat our enemies, because we're on the better side of history.""And at his speech accepting the Nobel Prize , Obama said: ""Whatever mistakes we have made, the plain fact is this: The United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms. The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea, and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans. We have borne this burden not because we seek to impose our will. We have done so out of enlightened self-interest -- because we seek a better future for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their lives will be better if others' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and prosperity.""We reviewed several analyses of what Obama's foreign policy goals are in traveling the world and readily admitting to America's mistakes. One of the most interesting essays we read was written by historian Walter Russell Mead for the journal Foreign Policy.Obama's foreign policy follows in the tradition of Thomas Jefferson and more recently of Jimmy Carter, Mead writes. Obama's goal is to reduce America's costs and risks overseas.In Obama's view, Mead writes, ""Large military budgets divert resources from pressing domestic needs; close association with corrupt and tyrannical foreign regimes involves the United States in dirty and cynical alliances; the swelling national-security state threatens civil liberties and leads to powerful pro-war, pro-engagement lobbies among corporations nourished on grossly swollen federal defense budgets. ...""Obama seeks a quiet world in order to focus his efforts on domestic reform -- and to create conditions that would allow him to dismantle some of the national-security state inherited from the Cold War and given new life and vigor after 9/11. Preferring disarmament agreements to military buildups and hoping to substitute regional balance-of-power arrangements for massive unilateral U.S. force commitments all over the globe, the president wishes ultimately for an orderly world in which burdens are shared and the military power of the United States is a less prominent feature on the international scene."" Our rulingIn reviewing Romney's book, we couldn't help but notice that Romney's diagnosis of the problems America faces are very similar to the themes Obama often repeats: The U.S. needs to educate its children better to remain competitive in the global marketplace. We spend too much money on health care. The fiscal future is ultimately unsustainable. It is in the matter of foreign policy that Romney lays out the most aggressive case against Obama, warning that the United States needs to maintain its military dominance in the world, particularly in the face of threats from China, Russia and Islamic jihadists. Obama, Romney writes, needs to ""proudly defend her rather than continually apologize for her.""Here, we're checking Romney's statement that Obama ""has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision"" and a host of other reasons. If you think American presidents should never admit to any sort of error at any time, you might find yourself in philosophical agreement with Romney's criticisms. We set out to discover whether Obama really had apologized in his speeches, and what he was apologizing for. But in our review of his words, we came up short. Yes, there is criticism in some of his speeches, but it's typically leavened by praise for the United States and its ideals, and often he mentions other countries and how they have erred as well.

Don Beyer (D-Va.) said he would support legislation to simplify the immigration visa system if both parties cannot come to an agreement on a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.“Absolutely, as we make sure that people are properly vetted for Homeland Security purposes. But, yeah, even the path to citizenship, there’s much we can do before that — letting people get driver’s licenses, making sure people are paying taxes — those aren't necessarily citizenship but it takes them out of the shadows, takes the families away from fear,” he told PJM at the Virginia Democrats’ election results event in the Beltway on Tuesday evening.“As a Democrat I would like comprehensive immigration reform, but I’ve talked to Bob Goodlatte, the [Virginia Republican] congressman who chairs the Judiciary Committee, and if there are incremental steps let’s take the incremental steps — things that we can agree on,” he added.Beyer suggested that the first step on immigration should be some kind of “identification document” that recognizes the presence of an undocumented immigrant who is paying taxes and “not breaking any laws.”“Do that first before creating the path to citizenship and that might be something we can get a lot of Republican votes for,” he said.Beyer said the current level of border protection is sufficient, calling the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border a “silly idea” that is never going to happen.Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) told PJM the visa process needs changes. He recommended that Congress reconsider the comprehensive immigration reform bill that failed in the Senate in 2013.“Clearly there are needs to have reforms of the visa process and both on H1B and H2B, both of those programs need reform. I know in terms of agriculture workers there are a lot of Virginia jobs that would be lost, particularly in the seafood industry if we didn’t have the guest-worker program,” he said.Warner was asked if he agrees with Vice President Biden that Democrats need to examine what drove Donald Trump’s supporters to the polls.https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/2016/11/09/virginia-dem-suggests-id-document-for-illegal-immigrants-to-show-theyre-not-breaking-any-laws/	0

Wendy Davis wrote, ""Texas women make an average of $8,355 less per year than men doing the very same job.""The Fort Worth Democrat concluded her note by calling out Republican Gov. Rick Perry’s June 2013 veto of legislation that would have changed state law to mimic the 2009 federal Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which made it easier for women to sue their employers over pay discrimination. Proponents said the Texas law was needed so women had recourse to state courts, not just federal ones.Pay gaps persist, PolitiFact colleagues have noted, though two claims like the one aired by Davis drew Mostly False ratings. Former President Jimmy Carter said in June 2013 that U.S. women are paid about 70 percent of what men earn for the same work. President Barack Obama said in a 2012 campaign ad that U.S. women are paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men. Both statements relied on data that did not speak to individuals doing the same or similar jobs, also overlooking variations in hours worked and lengths of tenure.Austin lawyer Terral Smith, a former Republican member of the Texas House, forwarded Davis’ email blast and asked us to investigate her pay-gap statement. By email, Smith wrote, ""Does the management at the (Austin) American-Statesman pay you less than your male counterparts? Seems like something from the 1950s.""Senator draws on 2010 dataBy email, Sonya Grogg, Davis’ chief of staff, told us that the $8,355 figure came from an April 2012 report from the National Partnership for Women & Families , an advocacy group for workplace fairness and other issues. The report drew on 2010 data from the U.S. Census Bureau indicating the median pay for a woman working full-time, year round in Texas was $33,689 annually that year, while the median pay for a man was $42,044. The report said these numbers amount to a ""yearly gap of $8,355 between full-time working men and women in the state.""According to the report, that means Texas women made 80 cents for every dollar paid to men.By this measure, too, Texas ranked better than 37 states, the partnership said. In Vermont, which had the smallest difference in pay, women were paid 84 cents for every dollar paid to men. Wyoming had the widest wage gap, with women making 64 cents for every dollar paid to men.More recent numbers suggest a narrower difference. Census Bureau data from 2012 found a wage gap of $7,859 between Texas men and women working full time, year round, according to an April 2013 report by the partnership.Cited information did not compare the same jobsAnother salient wrinkle is that Davis referred to a gap between Texas men and women doing the same jobs, which the partnership’s reports did not do. By phone, Cheryl Abbot, a Dallas-based regional economist for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, told us the figure aired by Davis is a comparison between all men and women, regardless of the type of work they do.In reality, for instance, more men hold higher-paying jobs. In Texas in 2011, men accounted for nearly 78 percent of workers in the higher-paid computer, engineering and science fields, according to Census Bureau data. Meanwhile, the data show that women account for nearly three in four workers in the lower-paid fields of education, training and library jobs.Studies have shown that, when occupational differences are accounted for, more than half of the gender wage gap is explained, Abbot said. She pointed us to Cornell University labor economists Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn, who wrote a February 2007 paper titled, ""The Gender Pay Gap: Have Women Gone Far Enough?"" The paper says that 53 percent of the gender wage gap stems from variation in job, industry and union status between the genders.Grogg acknowledged in her email on the senator’s behalf that applying the figure Davis cited to any specific job ""doesn’t work,"" though she also pointed out that a lawsuit filed in 2012 by the U.S. Department of Justice alleged that women in two state agencies made up to $23,157 less than men who had the same job as them, and said that ""partially verifies our statement."" In late 2012, the state agreed to pay $175,000 to settle the suit regarding the Texas Department of Agriculture and General Land Office.Relevant researchNext, we looked for on-point research on pay gaps between Texas men and women doing the same jobs.An expert on Texas demographics, Steve Murdock, who directs Rice University’s Hobby Center for the Study of Texas, directed us to a center associate director, Mike Cline, who by email sent us 2011 Census Bureau data specific to Texas. In more than half of 36 listed occupations, the pay gap that year exceeded the $8,355 cited by Davis. The largest gap -- $31,628 -- was between Texas men and women in health diagnosing and treating professions. The smallest difference, $71, was for men and women employed in installation, maintenance and repair. (See our chart based on what Cline provided here .)Even though the pay gap was more than $8,355 in most of the jobs listed, that doesn’t mean Davis is right, Cline said by telephone. There might be a smaller number of women employed in the jobs with the largest difference in earnings, and a larger number of women employed in the jobs with the smallest difference in earnings. If that’s the case, then more women could be working jobs with a wage gap less than $8,355. But, it could also be the other way around, Cline said.The lead economist at PayScale, a Seattle company that compiles salary information enabling clients to evaluate wages, counseled against reaching pay-gap conclusions based solely on such census data. Katie Bardaro said by telephone that the census figures do not control for differences in years of work experience, educational attainment or companies. For instance, Bardaro said, women may have fewer years in the work force; the median job tenure for men 25 years and older is about one month longer than for women, according to the labor bureau.We had reached out to the company after spotting its 2013 national study of the median pay for men and women in each of about 150 jobs, controlling for ""years of experience, education, company size, management responsibilities, skills and more,"" according to its website.The study also controlled for job-specific factors, for instance considering the types of offices where nurses worked. After controlling for numerous factors, ""the wage gap all but disappeared,"" Bardaro told us.Using information from 13,500 survey respondents, PayScale found, for example, that among civil engineers, registered nurses and human resource administrators, there was virtually no difference between what men and women earned. But there were noticeable differences for some upper-level management and executive positions. Male CEOs made $23,000 more than their female counterparts, according to PayScale. Bardaro said she attributes that to qualities that are hard to measure, such as relationships with co-workers.Estimated Texas gapIn Texas, which scored better than 24 states, PayScale saw a $2,000 gap between median pay for men and women in similar jobs, according to numbers Bardaro sent us by email. (See our chart of this information here .)There’s another reason why the $8,355 figure has weaknesses. Men might work longer hours, Bardaro said.Davis’ statistic comes from the earnings of full-time, year-round workers, which the Census Bureau defines as those who ""usually worked 35 hours or more per week for 50 to 52 weeks."" There’s a range of how many hours full-time workers log, and men are more likely than women to be on the job for 41 hours or more per week, according to the labor bureau . Because more men work overtime, that should translate into higher earnings for them -- because they are paid more, or because their longer hours lead to more job success -- and contribute to the wage gap.Though more nuanced analysis shows that job differences explain much of the pay gap, experts agree that much of it still cannot be accounted for. That’s where sexism comes in, some say. Even when looking at salaries job by job, men still make more than women in almost every single field.Our rulingDavis declared an average $8,355 earnings gap between Texas men and women working ""the very same job.""In 2010, that was the general gap between median salaries of full-time working Texas men and women, according to federal figures, while the 2012 gap was nearly $500 less. More significantly, the research that Davis tapped did not drill down to salaries for workers doing the same jobs. We found 2013 survey results indicating that among Texas workers with comparable professional experiences, there was a $2,000 gap between the median pay for men and women in the same or similar jobs.This statement, based on an outdated figure that also didn’t speak to people with the same jobs, still has an element of truth; sizable pay gaps exist. We rate the claim as Mostly False.Advertisement"	0

Paul Ryan saysBy Tom Kertscher on Thursday, June 19th, 2014 at 5:00 a.m.Soldiers from different NATO countries participated in military exercise ""Saber Strike 2014"" in Lithuania on June 17, 2014.Two days before President Barack Obama announced he would consider military options for halting a violent Islamic insurgency in Iraq, former vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan gave a speech on foreign policy.The Wisconsin Republican and House Budget Committee chairman, known primarily for his work on domestic issues, argued for a buildup of the U.S. military.And he suggested that America’s allies need to do more.Speaking June 11, 2014 at a Center for a New American Security conference in Washington, D.C., Ryan said that ""the fight against terrorism is global in scope. And we can’t fight it alone. We need partners.""He added:""We have to work better with all of our allies, all around the world. In Western Europe, we have to strike a balance. Our friends can’t depend on us for all of their defense needs and we can’t dictate to them all of their defense policies. Every member of NATO has pledged to spend at least 2 percent of their economy on defense. But only three countries do -- Britain, Greece and us.""NATO has 28 members .With tensions rising in Iraq, the Ukraine and elsewhere, is it true that only three NATO countries spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense?NATO's evolutionThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization was created in 1949, largely to provide collective security against the Soviet Union. There were 12 founding members , including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France and Italy.The new allies agreed that ""an armed attack against one or more of them … shall be considered an attack against them all"" and that following such an attack, each would take ""such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force.""From 2004 through 2011, NATO provided training in Iraq, helping the country develop its armed forces. More recently there has been a focus on the Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. About a week before Ryan gave his speech, NATO's top official said the alliance would finalize a package to modernize Ukraine's armed forces following Russia's annexation of the ex-Soviet republic's Crimea territory.The alliance is heavily dependent on the United States. According to NATO’s latest annual report , for 2013, U.S. defense expenditures accounted for nearly three-fourths of all NATO member defense expenditures:United States -- 73 percentFrance -- 4.9 percentGermany -- 4.7 percentSince 2007, the U.S. share has increased, from 68 percent, while the overall share from European members has decreased.Ryan’s claimTo back Ryan’s claim, his office cited the 2013 annual report. It notes that NATO members ""have collectively agreed to two guidelines to help encourage an equitable sharing of roles, risks and responsibilities.""One of the guidelines, or goals, as the report also calls it, is that members ""should devote at least 2 percent of gross domestic product to defense.""Only the United States, the United Kingdom and Greece met the 2 percent goal in 2013, the report says.But newer NATO figures , released in February 2014, show that a fourth member -- Estonia -- also met the 2 percent benchmark:NATO memberPercentage of gross domestic product spent on defenseUnited States"	0

http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/sep/11/kal-penn/kal-penn-thanks-obama-doubling-funding-pell-grant/	"	Says Obama doubled funding for the Pell Grant."	mostly true	['Education']	http://www.insidehighered.com/	http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/09/05/higher-ed-first-night-democratic-national-convention#ixzz265YlZzRp	2012/09/11	"Comments CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- As the Democratic National Convention officially opened here Tuesday night, President Obama’s actions over the past four years on higher education -- especially the Pell Grant -- were front and center.Tuesday night’s proceedings, the first of three nights officially kicking off Obama’s re-election campaign, featured two speakers from higher education. Nate Davis, the director of veterans’ services at Xavier University, spoke about his work on education benefits and his own history going to college on the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill. And Ryan Case, a University of Colorado at Boulder senior taking time off to work on the president’s campaign, was one of many touting the administration’s support for the Pell Grant for low-income students.“I've worked and saved and have a great family,” Case said. “But there's just no way I'd be able to pay for school without the Pell Grant funding President Obama doubled.”Along with the administration’s high-profile health-care overhaul, its support for the Pell Grant was a centerpiece of Tuesday’s event, which focused on domestic policy and concluded with a keynote address from San Antonio Mayor Julián Castro and a speech from First Lady Michelle Obama. Speaker after speaker, including members of Congress, big-city mayors like Castro, and Obama supporters like Case and Davis, mentioned that the president has doubled the amount of funding available for Pell Grants. They criticized the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, whose running mate, Representative Paul Ryan, is the author of a budget they said would devastate the program.“Our president has already doubled Pell Grants, raised education standards, invested in research and development at our universities and early childhood education in our neighborhoods,” said Newark Mayor Cory Booker, who presented the party's platform in an impassioned speech early Tuesday evening, using words that many other speakers later echoed. “Our platform and our president state it clearly: our nation cannot continue to be the world's No. 1 economy if we aren't committed to being the world's No. 1 educator.”Many speakers also included tributes to their own college education, including Obama, who recorded a video about his administration’s education policy that mentioned his education at Occidental College, Columbia University and Harvard Law School. “I had a chance to go to great colleges and a great law school,"" the president said. “I didn't come from a rich background, but I was able to get scholarships and loans and those doors were open for me.""Each time speakers mentioned Pell Grants, the tens of thousands of delegates in the Time Warner Cable Arena here roared in approval. But the program hasn’t fared as well over the past four years as Tuesday’s speeches might suggest.The Obama administration made sustaining the maximum Pell Grant -- right now, it’s $5,550 -- a priority in each of its annual budgets. Preserving the $5,550 grant required tradeoffs. Those came partly in cuts to other federal financial aid programs ( graduate students can no longer take out federally subsidized loans, and some benefits for subsidized undergraduate borrowers have been reduced), but also in changes to the Pell Grant Program itself. Eligibility changes that took effect this summer cut more than 100,000 students from the program, including some part-time students and those who have been enrolled for more than six semesters. An earlier change ended the summer Pell Grant, a cut that many community colleges fear will slow down students on their way to graduation.The speakers’ message: Romney -- and Ryan -- would be far worse for federal financial aid. “It's a choice between a nation that slashes funding for our schools and guts Pell Grants -- or a nation that invests more in education,” said Castro in his keynote speech Tuesday night.Higher Ed and the EconomyEarlier Tuesday, delegates, charitable foundations in Charlotte and representatives from Chambers of Commerce across the country heard a pitch for the economic benefits of higher education from the Lumina Foundation. A panel discussion about a recent report from the foundation and the Georgetown Center for Education and the Workforce argued that the delegates should consider higher education an economic necessity.Mick Fleming, president of American Chamber of Commerce Executives, took on recent criticisms of the idea of “ college for all ”: Some business leaders might say not everyone needs to go to college, he said, but few are satisfied with the level of education in their communities.The delegates in attendance didn’t seem too concerned about “college for all,” focusing instead on how federal policy makers could help more students, especially members of minority groups, graduate. One, from Texas, where affirmative action has been under fire in a case that will go to the Supreme Court this fall, asked how colleges could assure opportunity for students of all races in the future. Another, from Indiana, said that it took federal accountability standards for his state to pay attention to the achievement gap at the elementary and secondary level, and suggested similar steps might be needed for colleges.For their part, the panelists focused on oft-repeated calls to increase the number of Americans with degrees. “The people who say we have too many college-educated people are college-educated people,” said Charlie Nelms, the former chancellor of North Carolina Central University.Read more by"	0

Frank Wolf says U.S. has over $62 trillion in unfunded liabilitiesBy Wes Hester on Monday, May 23rd, 2011 at 8:00 a.m.Weeks ago, when credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s downgraded its outlook for U.S. debt from ""stable"" to ""negative,"" Rep. Frank R. Wolf, R-10th, was not surprised.""The warning flags are flying as we move closer and closer to the edge of the financial cliff,"" Wolf said in a statement on his website, pointing to his own previous alerts that the the nation’s mighty Triple-A credit rating was in jeopardy.Wolf called the downgrade a ""predictable warning,"" adding: ""I've been sounding a similar one for almost five years as I've tried to get the attention of Congress and the past and present administrations that America cannot continue on its current debt and deficit track, with over $14 trillion of debt, over $62 trillion in unfunded liabilities, and over one trillion dollar deficits projected for years to come,"" Wolf added.There’s one number in there that failed to ring a bell.We know the national debt is more than $14 trillion; in fact, we recently reached the debt limit of $14.3 trillion. It’s also true that future deficit projections -- under the current budget plan -- exceed $1 trillion annually. But is it true that the U.S. has more than $62 trillion in unfunded liabilities?We thought it was worth a look.For a source, Wolf’s office pointed to a 2010 report from the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, an organization devoted to public awareness of fiscal issues. The study contains a table entitled ""Major Fiscal Exposure."" A sum of $61.9 trillion is calculated for 2009, adding ""explicit liabilities"" (public debt, pensions, etc.) ""commitments and contingencies"" and ""social insurance promises"" (future social security benefits and future Medicare benefits).Predictably, the biggest driver of the staggering total is social insurance promises, which accounts for $45.8 trillion -- $38.2 trillion of which is future Medicare benefits. Social Security benefits account for the rest. As noted in fine print, the projections come from the Social Security and Medicare Trustees reports dated Jan. 1, 2009, and estimate benefits over the next 75 years. The rest of the data comes from the U.S. Treasury’s 2009 report.First, there’s an issue of terminology.""Technically, Mr. Wolf is in error because he calls the shortfalls in Social Security and Medicare ‘unfunded liabilities’"" said J.D. Foster, an economist with the right-leaning Heritage Foundation. ""Legally, they are not liabilities. They can be referred to accurately as promises or obligations.""Foster said the benefits do not qualify as liabilities because ""Congress can at any time reduce or alter them. In contrast, state pension plans are contractual labor arrangements that are liabilities because they are legally enforceable.""Gary Burtless, an economist with the left-leaning Brookings Institution, agreed, calling the idea that the government ""owes"" trillions of dollars to future citizens from a variety of programs under rules that are currently in effect ""ridiculous.""""The Supreme Court has ruled that the U.S.A. does not have a contractual obligation to pay Social Security and Medicare under rules that Congress has no power to change,"" Burtless said in an email. ""No citizen can expect to win a lawsuit that demands that benefits be paid that are as generous as the benefits that were ‘promised’ under some old, presumably more generous set of rules.""Nevertheless, we’ll limit the Truth-O-Meter point reductions on this point because the Peterson Foundation report and media reports we found refer to the future Social Security and Medicare benefits as ""liabilities"" rather than ""obligations."" The next problem is less debatable: the information is outdated.According to the latest Medicare and Social Security trustees reports, the numbers have changed significantly since 2009. Promised Medicare benefits for the next 75 years now total $24.6 trillion, according to 2011 numbers, and Social Security benefits have increased to $9.2 trillion.So Medicare obligations are now $13.6 trillion less than the data upon which Wolf based his claim , largely due to the health care reform act passed last year. Social Security obligations are $1.5 trillion trillion more. The net effect of those changes is that projections for future obligations are $12 trillion less than the 2009 data Wolf uses.But the trustees reports for this year hadn’t been released when Wolf made his claim, so we must look at the 2010 reports.Last year’s projections showed Medicare obligations to be $22.78 trillion over the 75 years and Social Security at $7.95 trillion for a total of $30.73 trillion. Using that comparison, Wolf’s off by even more, $15 trillion.And of course the debt has also changed. In the report Wolf cites, the publicly-held debt -- U.S. bonds held by individuals, institutions and foreign nations -- is listed as $7.6 trillion. On the day he issued his statement, it was $9.7 trillion. So add $2.1 trillion back and he’s off by almost $13 trillion.Other numbers have changed, too, but you get the point: The 2009 estimate was not a safe number in April 2011. Others argue that estimating unfunded obligations 75 years into the future is never safe. ""One can certainly come up with all kinds of scary – but essentially meaningless – estimates of the ‘unfunded liability’ of the federal government’s programs,"" Burtless, the Brookings economist, said. ""As a general rule of thumb, the bigger the estimate, the more meaningless it is.""Burtless noted that the numbers change wildly based on annual policy decisions and a 75-year measure was is arbitrary because obligation don’t end then.""It is impossible to predict 25 years into the future with much accuracy, let alone 75 years or all of eternity,"" he said.So let’s review.Wolf claims that the U.S. faces ""over $62 trillion in unfunded liabilities.""First, he and many others misuse the term ""unfunded liabilities"" to describe the future costs of government promises. Unlike a home mortgage, the U.S. is not locked into paying a certain amount based on existing terms. In fact, Congress changes the terms all the time. Secondly, the numbers Wolf based his claim on are badly outdated. In fact, using the 75-year estimates he cites, the figure would be significantly lower than $62 trillion based on 2011 figures.So, while Wolf’s claim is based on an actual figure, it’s an old one that was shaky to begin with given the distant projection and likelihood of change. We rate his claim Barely True.Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.Advertisement"	0

Tim Kaine and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence met face-to-face for the first time Tuesday night, as the running mates took part in the only vice-presidential debate of the 2016 election. The debate came amid Kaine and Hillary Clinton's newfound momentum in the race and as the Trump-Pence campaign continues to find itself on its heels -- due to a poor Trump debate performance last week and basically everything that has happened since. We've posted the complete transcript below, along with our annotations of the key moments, fact checks and other commentary. To see an annotation, click on the highlighted text. To make your own annotations, make sure you have a Genius account. QUIJANO: Good evening. From Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, and welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2016, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. QUIJANO: I'm Elaine Quijano, anchor at CBSN, and correspondent for CBS News. It's an honor to moderate this debate between Senator Tim Kaine and Governor Mike Pence. Both are longtime public servants who are also proud fathers of sons serving in the U.S. Marines. The campaigns have agreed to the rules of this 90-minute debate. There will be nine different segments covering domestic and foreign policy issues. Each segment will begin with a question to both candidates who will each have two minutes to answer. Then I'll ask follow-up questions to facilitate a discussion between the candidates. By coin toss, it's been determined that Senator Kaine will be first to answer the opening question. QUIJANO: We have an enthusiastic audience tonight. They've agreed to only express that enthusiasm once at the end of the debate and right now as we welcome Governor Mike Pence and Senator Tim Kaine. Gentlemen, welcome. It truly is a privilege to be with both of you tonight. QUIJANO: I'd like to start with the topic of presidential leadership. Twenty-eight years ago tomorrow night, Lloyd Bentsen said the vice presidential debate was not about the qualifications for the vice presidency, but about how if tragedy should occur, the vice president has to step in without any margin for error, without time for preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world. What about your qualities, your skills, and your temperament equip you to step into that role at a moment's notice? Senator Kaine? KAINE: Elaine, thank you for being here tonight, and, Governor Pence, welcome. It is so great to be back at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. This is a very special place. Sixty-five years ago, a young, courageous woman, Barbara Johns, led a walkout of her high school, Moton High School. She made history by protesting school segregation. She believed our nation was stronger together. And that walkout led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that moved us down the path toward equality. I am so proud to be running with another strong, history-making woman, Hillary Clinton, to be president of the United States. I'm proud because her vision of stronger together, building an economy that works for all, not just those at the top, being safe in the world not only with a strong military, but also strong alliances to battle terrorism and climate change, and also to build a community of respect, just like Barbara Johns tried to do 65 years ago. That's why I'm so proud to be her running mate. Hillary told me why she asked me to be her running mate. She said the test of a Clinton administration will not be the signing of a bill or the passage of a bill. It'll be whether we can make somebody's life better, whether we can make a classroom better learning environment for schoolkids or teachers, whether we can make a safer -- it's going to be about results. And she said to me, you've been a missionary and a civil rights lawyer. You've been a city councilman and mayor. You've been a lieutenant governor and governor and now a U.S. senator. I think you will help me figure out how to govern this nation so that we always keep in mind that the success of the administration is the difference we make in people's lives. And that's what I bring to the ticket, that experience having served at all levels of government. But my primary role is to be Hillary Clinton's right-hand person and strong supporter as she puts together the most historic administration possible. And I relish that role. I'm so proud of her. KAINE: I'll just say this: We trust Hillary Clinton, my wife and I, and we trust her with the most important thing in our life. We have a son deployed overseas in the Marine Corps right now. We trust Hillary Clinton as president and commander-in-chief, but the thought of Donald Trump as commander-in-chief scares us to death. QUIJANO: Governor Pence? PENCE: Well, first off, thank you, Elaine, and thank you to -- thank you to Norwood University for their wonderful hospitality and the Commission on Presidential Debates. It's deeply humbling for me to be here, to be surrounded by my -- my wonderful family. And, Senator Kaine, it's an honor to be here with you, as well. And I just -- I also want to say -- I want to say thanks to everyone that's looking in tonight, who understands what an enormously important time this is in the life of our nation. For the last seven-and-a-half years, we've seen America's place in the world weakened. We've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal, and a failing health care reform come to be known as Obamacare, and the American people know that we need to make a change. And so I want to thank all of you for being -- being with us tonight. PENCE: I also want to thank Donald Trump for making that call and inviting us to be a part of this ticket. I have to tell you, I'm a -- I'm a small-town boy from a place not too different from Farmville. I grew up with a cornfield in my backyard. My grandfather had immigrated to this country when he was about my son's age. My mom and dad built a -- everything that matters in a small town in Southern Indiana. They built a family and -- and a good name and a business. And they raised a family. And I dreamed some day of representing my home town in Washington, D.C., but I -- honestly, Elaine, I never imagined -- never imagined I'd have the opportunity to be governor of the state that I love, let alone be sitting at a table like this in this kind of a position. So to answer your question, I would say I -- I would hope that if -- if the responsibility ever fell to me in this role, that I would meet it with the way that I'm going to meet the responsibility should I be elected vice president of the United States. And that's to bring a lifetime of experience, a lifetime growing up in a small town, a lifetime where I've served in the Congress of the United States, where -- where I've led a state that works in the great state of Indiana, and whatever other responsibilities might follow from this, I -- I would hope and, frankly, I would pray to be able to meet that moment with that -- that lifetime of experience. QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, on the campaign trail, you praised Secretary Clinton's character, including her commitment to public service, yet 60 percent of voters don't think she's trustworthy. Why do so many people distrust her? Is it because they have questions about her e-mails and the Clinton Foundation? KAINE: Elaine, let me tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton. Here's what people should look at as they look at a public servant. Do they have a passion in their life that showed up before they were in public life? And have they held onto that passion throughout their life, regardless of whether they were in office or not, succeeding or failing? Hillary Clinton has that passion. From a time as a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago, she has been focused on serving others with a special focus on empowering families and kids. As a civil rights lawyer in the South, with the Children's Defense Fund, first lady of Arkansas and this country, senator, secretary of state, it's always been about putting others first. And that's a sharp contrast with Donald Trump. Donald Trump always puts himself first. He built a business career, in the words of one of his own campaign staffers, ""off the backs of the little guy."" And as a candidate, he started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals, and he has pursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that President Obama wasn't born in the United States. It is so painful to suggest that we go back to think about these days where an African-American could not be a citizen of the United States. And I can't imagine how Governor Pence can defend the insult- driven selfish ""me first"" style of Donald Trump. QUIJANO: Governor Pence, let me ask you, you have said Donald Trump is, quote, ""thoughtful, compassionate, and steady."" Yet 67 percent of voters feel he is a risky choice, and 65 percent feel he does not have the right kind of temperament to be president. Why do so many Americans think Mr. Trump is simply too erratic? PENCE: Well, let me -- let me say first and foremost that, Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult- driven campaign. It really is remarkable. At a time when literally, in the wake of Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, where she was the architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy, we see entire portions of the world, particularly the wider Middle East, literally spinning out of control. I mean, the situation we're watching hour by hour in Syria today is the result of the failed foreign policy and the weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead in this administration and create. The newly emboldened -- the aggression of Russia, whether it was in Ukraine or now they're heavy-handed approach... KAINE: You guys love Russia. You both have said... PENCE: ... their heavy-handed approach. KAINE: You both have said -- you both have said Vladimir Putin is a better leader than the president. QUIJANO: Well, we're going to get to Russia in just a moment. But I do want to get back to the question at... PENCE: But in the midst -- Elaine, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Senator, I'll... KAINE: These guys have praised Vladimir Putin as a great leader. How can that... QUIJANO: Yes, and we will get to that, Senator. We do have that coming up here. But in the meantime, the questions... PENCE: Well, Senator, I must have hit a... PENCE: I must have hit a nerve here. QUIJANO: Why the disconnect? PENCE: Because at a time of great challenge in the life of this nation, where we've weakened America's place in the world, stifled America's economy, the campaign of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine has been an avalanche of insults. Look, to get to your question about trustworthiness, Donald Trump has built a business through hard times and through good times. He's brought an extraordinary business acumen. He's employed tens of thousands of people in this country. KAINE: And paid few taxes and lost a billion a year. QUIJANO: And why the disconnect with your running mate? PENCE: But there's a -- there's a reason why people question the trustworthiness of Hillary Clinton. And that's because they're paying attention. I mean, the reality is, when she was secretary of state, Senator, come on. She had a Clinton Foundation accepting contributions from foreign governments. KAINE: You are Donald Trump's apprentice. Let me talk about this... PENCE: Senator, I think I'm still on my time. KAINE: Well, I think -- isn't this a discussion? QUIJANO: This is our open discussion. KAINE: Yeah, let's talk about the state of... PENCE: Well, let me interrupt -- let me interrupt you and finish my sentence, if I can. KAINE: Finish your sentence. PENCE: The Clinton Foundation accepted foreign contributions from foreign governments and foreign donors while she was secretary of state. KAINE: OK, now I can weigh in. Now... PENCE: She had a private server... KAINE: Now, I get to weigh in. Now, let me just say this... PENCE: ... that was discovered... QUIJANO: ... Senator, you have an opportunity to respond. PENCE: ... keep that pay to play process out of the reach of the public. KAINE: Governor Pence -- Governor Pence doesn't think the world's going so well and he, you know, is going to say it's everybody's fault. KAINE: Let me tell you this. When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, Governor Pence, did you know that Osama bin Laden was alive? KAINE: Do you know that we had 175,000 troops deployed in the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan? Do you know that Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon and Russia was expanding its stockpile? Under Secretary Clinton's leadership, she was part of the national team, public safety team that went after and revived the dormant hunt against bin Laden and wiped him off the face of the Earth. She worked to deal with the Russians to reduce their chemical weapons stockpile. She worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot. PENCE: Eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program? KAINE: Absolutely, without firing a shot. And instead of 175,000 American troops deployed overseas, we now have 15,000. KAINE: These are very, very good things. PENCE: And Iraq has been overrun by ISIS, because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate... KAINE: Well, if you want to put more American troops in Iraq, you can propose that. PENCE: Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement... KAINE: No, that is incorrect. That's incorrect. PENCE: And so we removed -- we removed all of our... QUIJANO: Gentlemen, we'll get to... PENCE: ... troops from Iraq, and ISIS was able to be conjured up in that vacuum. KAINE: But I'd like to correct... PENCE: ... and overrun vast areas of Iraq. KAINE: Governor, President Bush said we would leave Iraq at the end of 2011. And, Elaine, Iraq didn't want our troops to stay, and they wouldn't give us the protection for our troops. And guess what? If a nation where our troops are serving does not want us to stay, we're not going to stay without their protection. PENCE: It was a failure of the secretary of state... QUIJANO: We need to move on to the next topic, gentlemen. KAINE: If Governor Pence wants to put more troops back in Iraq, that's... QUIJANO: There are a lot of people wondering in this country about the economy. Let's turn to the issue of the economy. QUIJANO: According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, neither of your economic plans will reduce the growing $19 trillion gross national debt. In fact, your plans would add even more to it. Both of you were governors who balanced state budgets. Are you concerned that adding more to the debt could be disastrous for the country. Governor Pence? PENCE: I think the fact that -- that under this past administration was of which Hillary Clinton was a part, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious. I mean, I'm very proud of the fact that -- I come from a state that works. The state of Indiana has balanced budgets. We cut taxes, we've made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank. That's a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia. He actually -- he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion. He left his state about $2 billion in the hole. In the state of Indiana, we've cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor. PENCE: But I think he's a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton, because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same. It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that. You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful. But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan. But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare. They want to expand it into a single-payer program. And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start. Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy. We can get America moving again. Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that'll put the American worker first, and you've got a prescription for real growth. And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that's when you can deal with the national debt. When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trump's plan will do, then we're going to have the resources to meet our nation's needs at home and abroad, and we're going to have the ability to bring down the national debt. QUIJANO: Senator Kaine? KAINE: Elaine, on the economy, there's a fundamental choice for the American electorate. Do you want a ""you're hired"" president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a ""you're fired"" president in Donald Trump? I think that's not such a hard choice. Hillary and I have a plan that's on the table that's a ""you're hired"" plan. Five components. First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow. Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year. Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can't work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work. Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we've done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses. Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families. My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight. And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who've benefited as we've come out of recession to pay more. KAINE: The Trump plan is a different plan. It's a ""you're fired"" plan. And there's two key elements to it. First, Donald Trump said wages are too high. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage. Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15. And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana. The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump. The problem with this, Elaine, is that's exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession -- the deepest recession since the 1930s. Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs. The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs. And Donald Trump -- why would he do this? Because his tax plan basically helps him. And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan. QUIJANO: On that point, Governor Pence, recently the New York Times released part of Mr. Trump's 1995 tax return and reported that he could have avoided paying federal income taxes for years. Yesterday, Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible. Does that seem fair to you? PENCE: Well, first, let me say, I appreciated the ""you're hired,"" ""you're fired"" thing, Senator. You use that a whole lot. And I think your running mate used a lot of pre-done lines. Look, what -- what you all just heard out there is more taxes, $2 trillion in more spending, more deficits, more debt, more government. And if you think that's all working, then you look at the other side of the table. I mean, the truth of the matter is, the policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine want to continue, have run this economy into a ditch. We're in the... KAINE: Fifteen million new jobs? PENCE: ... slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. KAINE: Fifteen million new jobs? QUIJANO: Governor... PENCE: There are millions more people living in poverty today than the day that Barack Obama with Hillary Clinton at his side... KAINE: And the poverty level and the median income... PENCE: ... stepped into the Oval Office. KAINE: ... improved dramatically between 2014 and 2015. PENCE: You -- honestly, Senator, you can roll out the numbers and the sunny side, but I got to tell you, people in Scranton know different. People in Fort Wayne, Indiana, know different. I mean, this economy is struggling. The answer to this economy is not more taxes. KAINE: But it's not the giveaway tax relief to the folks at the top. PENCE: It's not more spending... KAINE: I am interested to hear whether he'll defend his running mate's not releasing taxes and not paying taxes. PENCE: Absolutely I will. QUIJANO: Governor, with all due respect, the question was about whether it seems fair to you that Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible. PENCE: Well, this is probably the difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine. And, I mean, Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine -- God bless you for it, career public servants, that's great -- Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician. He actually built a business. Those tax returns that were -- that came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago. But like virtually every other business, including the New York Times not too long ago, he used what's called net operating loss. We have a tax code, Senator, that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship in this country. KAINE: But why won't he release his tax returns? PENCE: Well, we're answering the question about -- about a business thing, is he... KAINE: I do want to come back to that, but... PENCE: His tax returns -- his tax returns showed he went through a very difficult time, but he used the tax code just the way it's supposed to be used. And he did it brilliantly. KAINE: How do you know that? You haven't seen his tax returns. PENCE: He created a runway -- because he's created a business that's worth billions of dollars today. KAINE: How do you know that? PENCE: And with regard to paying taxes, this whole riff about not paying taxes and people saying he didn't pay taxes for years, Donald Trump has created tens of thousands of jobs. And he's paid payroll taxes, sales taxes, property taxes... KAINE: Elaine, let me talk about something. QUIJANO: Senator, I'm going to give you about 30 seconds to respond, and I have question on Social Security for you. PENCE: The only issue on taxes -- Hillary Clinton is going to raise taxes, and Donald Trump and I are going to cut them. KAINE: Donald Trump started this campaign in 2014 and he said, ""If I run for president, I will absolutely release my taxes."" He's broken his first... KAINE: He's broken his first promise. Second, he stood on the stage... PENCE: He hasn't broken his promise. He said he's... KAINE: He stood on the stage last week and when Hillary said, you haven't been paying taxes, he said, ""That makes me smart."" So it's smart not to pay for our military? It's smart not to pay for veterans? It's smart not to pay for teachers? And I guess all of us who do pay for those things, I guess we're stupid. And the last thing I'll say is this... PENCE: Senator, do you take all the deductions that you're entitled to? KAINE: The last thing -- the last thing I want to ask Governor Pence is... KAINE: Governor Pence had to give Donald Trump his tax returns to show he was qualified to be vice president. Donald Trump must give the American public his tax returns to show that he's qualified to be president. And he's breaking his promise. PENCE: Elaine, I have to respond to this. QUIJANO: You get very little time, 20 seconds. PENCE: I'll be -- I'll be very respectful. PENCE: Look, Donald Trump has filed over 100 pages of financial disclosure, which is what the law requires. KAINE: But he said he would release his tax returns. QUIJANO: All right, Gentlemen... PENCE: The American people can review that. And he's going -- Senator, he's going to release his tax returns when the audit is over... QUIJANO: ... I need to ask you about Social Security... KAINE: Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit. PENCE: They're going to raise your taxes. We're going to cut your taxes. QUIJANO: Gentlemen... KAINE: If you can't meet Nixon's standard... QUIJANO: The people at home cannot understand either one of you when you speak over each other. I would please ask you to wait until it is that the other is finished. KAINE: All right. We're having fun up here. QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, on the issue of Social Security, in 18 years, when the Social Security Trust Funds run out of money, you'll be 76. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates your benefits could be cut by as much as $7,500 per year. What would your administration do to prevent this cut? KAINE: First, we're going to protect Social Security, which is one of the greatest programs that the American government has ever done. It happened at a time when you would work your whole life, your whole life, raising your kids, working, being a Little League coach or a Sunday school teacher, and then you would retire into poverty. And Social Security has enabled people to retire with dignity and overwhelmingly not be in poverty. We have to keep it solvent. And we will keep it solvent. And we'll look for strategies like adjusting the payroll tax cap upward in order to do that. Here's what Hillary and I will not do. And I want to make this very plain. We will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security. Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us. And when Congressman Pence was in Congress, he was the chief cheerleader for the privatization of Social Security. Even after President Bush stopped pushing for it, Congressman Pence kept pushing for it. We're going to stand up against efforts to privatize Social Security. And we'll look for ways to keep it solvent going forward, focusing primarily on the payroll tax cap. QUIJANO: Governor Pence, I'll give you an opportunity to respond. PENCE: Well, thanks, Elaine. There they go again. OK... KAINE: Go read -- go read the book. PENCE: All Donald Trump -- all Donald Trump and I have said about Social Security is we're going to meet our obligations to our seniors. That's it. KAINE: Go read the book. PENCE: We've said we're going to meet the obligations of Medicare. That's what this campaign is really about, Senator. And I get, this is -- this is the old scare tactic that they roll out... KAINE: But -- but you have a voting record, Governor. PENCE: And I get all of that. I just, look... PENCE: There's a question that you asked a little bit earlier that I want to go back to. KAINE: I can't believe that you won't defend your own voting record. PENCE: I have to go back to. PENCE: Well, look, I -- you're running with Hillary Clinton, who wants to raise taxes by $1 trillion, increase spending by $2 trillion, and you say you're going to keep the promises of Social Security. Donald Trump and I are going to cut taxes. We're going to -- we're going to -- we're going to... KAINE: You're not going to cut taxes. You're going to raise taxes on the middle class. PENCE: ... reform government programs so we can meet the obligations of Social Security and Medicare. QUIJANO: All right. PENCE: Stay on the path that your party has us on, we're going to be in a -- in a mountain range of debt. And we're going to face hard choices and... QUIJANO: Gentleman, I want to move on now. KAINE: You did ask this question about debt, and the debt explosion on the Trump plan is much, much bigger than anything on the Clinton side. QUIJANO: All right. Let me move on now... PENCE: Three hundred and five (ph) economists said your plan is bad for the economy. QUIJANO: ... to the issue of law enforcement and race relations. Law enforcement and race relations. After the Dallas police shooting, Police Chief David Brown said, quote, ""We're asking cops to do too much in this country. Every societal failure we put it off on the cops to solve. Not enough mental health funding, not enough drug addiction funding, schools fail, let's give it to the cops."" Do we ask too much of police officers in this country? And how would you specifically address the chief's concerns? Senator Kaine? KAINE: Elaine, I think that's a very fair comment. I think we put a lot on police shoulders. And this is something I got a lot of scar tissue and experience on. I was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond. And when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States. We fought very, very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department, and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half. And then when I was governor of Virginia, we worked hard, too. And we did something we had really wanted to do. For the first time ever, we cracked the top 10, 10 safest states, because we worked together. Here's what I learned as a mayor and a governor. The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing. You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows. And when that gap narrows, it's safer for the communities and it's safer for the police. That model still works across our country, but there are some other models that don't work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model. Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country. That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community. So here's what we'll do. We'll focus on community policing. We will focus on -- and Hillary Clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals, and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the United States. I'm a gun-owner. I'm a strong Second Amendment supporter. But I've got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we're going to work to do things like close background record checks. And if we do, we won't have the tragedies that we did. One of those killed at Virginia Tech was a guy named Liviu Librescu. He was a 70-plus-year-old Romanian Holocaust survivor. He had survived the Holocaust. Then he survived the Soviet Union takeover of his country. But then he was a visiting professor at Virginia Tech, and he couldn't survive the scourge of gun violence. We can support the Second Amendment and do things like background record checks and make us safer, and that will make police safer, too. QUIJANO: Governor Pence? PENCE: You know, my uncle was a cop, a career cop, on the beat in downtown Chicago. He was my hero when I was growing up. And we'd go up to visit my dad's family in Chicago. My three brothers and I would marvel at my uncle when he would come out in his uniform, sidearm at his side. Police officers are the best of us. And the men and women, white, African-American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day. And let my say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea. It's worked in the Hoosier state. And we fully support that. Donald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation. It's probably -- probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them. They see his commitment to law and order. But they also -- they also hear the bad mouthing, the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as -- as a reason to -- to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of -- of implicit bias or institutional racism. And that really has got to stop. I mean, when an African-American police officer in Charlotte named Brentley Vinson, an all-star football player who went to Liberty University here in the state, came home, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of Keith -- Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy. I mean, I -- we -- we mourn with those who mourn. We -- we grieve with those who grieve. And we're saddened at the loss of life. But Hillary Clinton actually referred to that moment as an example of implicit bias in the police force, where -- where she used -- when she was asked in the debate a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, her only answer was that there's implicit bias in everyone in the United States. I just think... KAINE: Can I -- can I explain... PENCE: ... I just think what we ought to do is we ought to stop seizing on these moments of tragedy. We ought to assure the public that we'll have a full and complete and transparent investigation whenever there's a loss of life because of police action. But, Senator, please, you know, enough of this seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making the accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs. KAINE: Elaine -- Elaine, people shouldn't be afraid to bring up issues of bias in law enforcement. And if you're afraid to have... PENCE: I'm not afraid to bring that up. KAINE: And if -- if you're afraid to have the discussion, you'll never solve it. And so here's -- here's an example, heartbreaking. We would agree this was a heartbreaking example. The guy, Philando Castile, who was killed in St. Paul, he was a worker, a valued worker in a local school. And he was killed for no apparent reason in an incident that will be discussed and will be investigated. But when folks went and explored this situation, what they found is that Philando Castile, who was a -- they called him Mr. Rogers with Dreadlocks in the school that he worked. The kids loved him. But he had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times before that fatal incident. And if you look at sentencing in this country, African-Americans and Latinos get sentenced for the same crimes at very different rates. PENCE: We need criminal justice reform. PENCE: Indiana has passed criminal justice reform. KAINE: But I just want to say, those who say that we should not... PENCE: But that's not what you're talking about. KAINE: ... we should not be able to bring up and talk about bias in the system, we'll never solve the problem... QUIJANO: Governor Pence... QUIJANO: Governor Pence... PENCE: Senator, when African-American police officers involved in a police action shooting involving an African-American, why would Hillary Clinton accuse that African-American police officer of implicit bias? KAINE: Well, I guess I can't believe you are defending the position that there is no bias and it's a topic we don't even... QUIJANO: Governor Pence, I have a question on that point. PENCE: I did not make that statement. I... QUIJANO: Your fellow Republican, Governor Pence, Senator Tim Scott, who is African-American, recently spoke on the Senate floor. He said he was stopped seven times by law enforcement in one year. KAINE: A U.S. senator. QUIJANO: He said, ""I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness, and the humiliation that comes with feeling like you're being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself."" What would you say to Senator Scott about his experiences? PENCE: Well, I have the deepest respect for Senator Scott, and he's a close friend. And what I would say is that we -- we need to adopt criminal justice reform nationally. I -- I signed criminal justice reform in the state of Indiana, Senator, and we're very proud of it. I worked when I was Congress on a second chance act. We have got to do a better job recognizing and correcting the errors in the system that do reflect on institutional bias in criminal justice. But what -- what -- what Donald Trump and I are saying is let's not have the reflex of assuming the worst of men and women in law enforcement. We truly do believe that law enforcement is not a force for racism or division in our country... KAINE: Elaine, can I... QUIJANO: So what would you say to Senator Scott, Governor? PENCE: Law enforcement in this country is a force for good. They are the -- they truly are people that put their lives on the line every single day. But I would -- I would suggest to you, what we need to do is assert a stronger leadership at the national level to support law enforcement. You just heard Senator Kaine reject stop-and-frisk. Well, I would suggest to you that the families that live in our inner cities that are besieged by crime... KAINE: Elaine, let me -- let me... QUIJANO: Governor, the question is about Senator Scott. What would -- what would you tell Senator Scott? KAINE: Elaine, if I could -- if I could jump in. I've heard Senator Scott make that eloquent plea. And look, criminal justice is about respecting the law and being respected by the law. So there is a fundamental respect issue here. And I just want to talk about the tone that's set from the top. Donald Trump during his campaign has called Mexicans rapists and criminals. He's called women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting. I don't like saying that in front of my wife and my mother. He attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified to hear a federal lawsuit because his parents were Mexican. He went after John McCain, a POW, and said he wasn't hero because he'd been captured. He said African-Americans are living in Hell. And he perpetrated this outrageous and bigoted lie that President Obama is not a U.S. citizen. If you want to have a society where people are respected and respect laws, you can't have somebody at the top who demeans every group that he talks about. And I just -- again, I cannot believe that Governor Pence will defend the insult-driven campaign that Donald Trump has run. QUIJANO: All right. I want to turn to our next segment now, immigration. Your running mates have both said that undocumented immigrants who have committed violent crimes should be deported. What would you tell the millions of undocumented immigrants who have not committed violent crimes? Governor Pence? PENCE: Donald Trump's laid out a plan to end illegal immigration once and for all in this country. We've been talking it to death for 20 years. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to continue the policies of open borders, amnesty, catch and release, sanctuary cities, all the things that are driving -- that are driving wages down in this country, Senator, and also too often with criminal aliens in the country, it's bringing heartbreak. But I -- Donald Trump has a plan that he laid out in Arizona, that will deal systemically with illegal immigration, beginning with border security, internal enforcement. It's probably why for the first time in the history of Immigration and Customs Enforcement their union actually endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States, because they know they need help to enforce the laws of this country. And Donald Trump has laid out a priority to remove criminal aliens, remove people that have overstayed their visas. And -- and once we have accomplished all of that, which will -- which will strengthen our economy, strengthen the rule of law in the country and make our communities safer once the criminal aliens are out, then we'll deal with those that remain. But I have to tell you, I just -- I was listening to the avalanche of insults coming out of Senator Kaine a minute ago. KAINE: These were Donald's -- hold on a second, Governor. PENCE: It's my time, Senator. QUIJANO: It is, in fact, the governor's time. KAINE: I apologize. It's your two minutes. I apologize. PENCE: Thanks. I forgive you. He says ours is an insult-driven campaign. Did you all just hear that? Ours is an insult-driven campaign? I mean, to be honest with you, if Donald Trump had said all of the things that you've said he said in the way you said he said them, he still wouldn't have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she said that half of our supporters were a basket of deplorables. It's -- she said they were irredeemable, they were not American. I mean, it's extraordinary. And then she labeled one after another ""ism"" on millions of Americans who believe that we can have a stronger America at home and abroad, who believe we can get this economy moving again, who believe that we can end illegal immigration once and for all. So, Senator, this -- this insult-driven campaign, I mean... PENCE: That's small potatoes compared to Hillary Clinton... QUIJANO: Senator Kaine? PENCE: .... calling half of Donald Trump's supporters a basket of deplorables. KAINE: Hillary Clinton said something on the campaign trail, and the very next day, she said, you know what, I shouldn't have said that. PENCE: She said she shouldn't have said half. QUIJANO: Governor, this is Senator Kaine's two minutes, please. KAINE: Yeah, that's right, so now we're even. KAINE: Look for Donald trump apologizing to John McCain for saying he wasn't a hero... KAINE: ... to Donald Trump apologizing for calling women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting. PENCE: She apologized for saying ""half."" QUIJANO: Governor. It is his two minutes, please. KAINE: Did Donald Trump apologize for taking after somebody in a Twitter war and making fun of her weight? Did he apologize for saying African-Americans are living in Hell? Did he apologize for saying President Obama was not even a citizen of the United States? You will look in vain to see Donald Trump ever taking responsibility for anybody and apologizing. Immigration. There's two plans on the table. Hillary and I believe in comprehensive immigration reform. Donald Trump believes in deportation nation. You've got to pick your choice. Hillary and I want a bipartisan reform that will put keeping families together as the top goal, second, that will help focus enforcement efforts on those who are violent, third, that will do more border control, and, fourth, that will provide a path to citizenship for those who work hard, pay taxes, play by the rules, and take criminal background record checks. That's our proposal. Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people, 11 million who are here without documents. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship. So if you're born here, but your parents don't have documents, they want to eliminate that. That's another 4.5 million people. These guys -- and Donald Trump have said it -- deportation force. They want to go house to house, school to school, business to business, and kick out 16 million people. And I cannot believe... PENCE: That's nonsense. That's nonsense. KAINE: I cannot believe that Governor Pence would sit here and defend his running mate's claim that we should create a deportation force to -- so that they'll all be gone. PENCE: Senator, we have a deportation force. It's called Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. And the union for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement for the first time in their history endorsed Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States of America. KAINE: So you like the 16 million deportations? PENCE: Senator, that's -- that's nonsense. Look, what you just heard is they have a plan for open borders, amnesty. That's... KAINE: Our plan is like Ronald Reagan's plan from 1986. PENCE: They call it comprehensive immigration reform -- they call it comprehensive immigration reform on Capitol Hill. We all know the routine. It's amnesty. And you heard one of the last things he mentioned was border security. PENCE: That's how Washington always plays it. PENCE: They always say we're going to do this, we're going to do that, we'll eventually get the border... KAINE: ... border security three years ago, and Governor Pence was against it. QUIJANO: Governor, Mr. Trump has said... PENCE: Ronald Reagan said a nation without borders is not a nation. Donald Trump is committed to restoring the borders of this nation and securing our nation, enforcing our laws. QUIJANO: So, Governor, how would these millions of undocumented immigrants leave? Would they be forcibly removed? PENCE: Well, I think Donald Trump laid out a series of priorities that doesn't ends with border security. It begins with border security. And after we secure the border, not only build a wall, but beneath the ground and in the air, we do internal enforcement. But he said the focus has to be on criminal aliens. We just -- we just had a conversation about law enforcement. We just had a conversation about the -- the violence that's besetting our cities. The reality is that there's heartbreak and tragedy that has struck American families because people that came into this country illegally are now involved in criminal enterprise and activity. And we don't have the resources or the will to deport them systemically. Donald Trump has said we're going to move those people out, people who've overstayed their visas. We're going to enforce the law of this country. We're going to strengthen Immigrations and Customs Enforcements with more resources and more personnel to be able to do that. And then Donald Trump has made it clear, once we've done all of those things, that we're going to reform the immigration system that we have... KAINE: I just have to correct Governor Pence.... PENCE: ... where people can come into this country. PENCE: That's the order that you should do it. Border security, removing criminal aliens, upholding with law, and then -- but then, Senator, I'll work you when you go back to the Senate, I promise you, we'll work you to reform the immigration system. KAINE: I look forward to working together in whatever capacities we serve in. But I just want to make it very, very clear that he's trying to fuzz up what Donald Trump has said. When Donald Trump spoke in Phoenix, he looked the audience in the eye and he said, no, we're building a wall, and we're deporting everybody. He said, quote, ""They will all be gone."" ""They will all be gone."" And this is one of these ones where you can just go to the tape on it and see what Donald Trump has said. And to add... PENCE: He's talking about criminal aliens. KAINE: And to add to it, and to add to it, and to add to it, we are a nation of immigrants. Mike Pence and I both are descended from immigrant families. Some things, you know, maybe weren't said so great about the Irish when they came, but we've done well by absorbing immigrants, and it's made our nation stronger. When Donald Trump says Mexicans are rapists and criminals, Mexican immigrants, when Donald Trump says about your judge, a Hoosier judge, he said that Judge Curiel was unqualified to hear a case because his parents were Mexican, I can't imagine how you could defend that. QUIJANO: Gentleman, I'd like to shift now to the threat of terrorism. Do you think the world today is a safer or more dangerous place than it was eight years ago? Has the terrorist threat increased or decreased? Senator Kaine? KAINE: The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways, because bin Laden is dead. The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because an Iranian nuclear weapons program has been stopped. The terrorist threat to United States troops has been decreased in some ways because there's not 175,000 in a dangerous part of the world. There's only 15,000. But there are other parts of the world that are challenging. Let me tell you this: To beat terrorism, there's only one candidate who can do it, and it's Hillary Clinton. Remember, Hillary Clinton was the senator from New York on 9/11. She was there at the World Trade Center when they were still searching for victims and survivors. That's seared onto her, the need to beat terrorism. And she's got a plan to do it. She was part of the national security team that wiped out bin Laden. Here's her plan to defeat ISIL. First, we've got to keep taking out their leaders on the battlefield. She was part of the team that got bin Laden, and she'll lead the team that will get Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS. Second, we've got to disrupt financing networks, third, disrupt their ability to recruit on the Internet, in their safe havens. But, fourth, we also have to work with allies to share and surge intelligence. That's the Hillary Clinton plan; she's got the experience to do it. Donald Trump. Donald Trump can't start a Twitter war with Miss Universe without shooting himself in the foot. Donald Trump doesn't have a plan. He said, ""I have a secret plan,"" and then he said, ""Um, I know more than all the generals about ISIL."" And then he said, ""I'm going to call the generals to help me figure out a plan."" And finally he said, ""I'm going to fire all the generals."" He doesn't have a plan. But he does have dangerous ideas. Here's four. He trash talks the military. The military is a disaster, John McCain's no hero, the generals need all to be fired, and I know more than them. He wants to tear up alliances. NATO is obsolete, and we'll only work together with Israel if they pay ""big league."" Third, he loves dictators. He's got kind of a personal Mount Rushmore, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, Moammar Gadhafi... PENCE: Oh, please. Come on. KAINE: ... and Saddam Hussein. And last and most dangerously, Donald Trump believes -- Donald Trump believes that the world will be safer if more nations have nuclear weapons. He's said Saudi Arabia should get them, Japan should get them, Korea should get them. And when he was confronted with this, and told, wait a minute, terrorists could get those, proliferation could lead to nuclear war, here's what Donald Trump said, and I quote: ""Go ahead, folks, enjoy yourselves."" I'd love to hear Governor Pence tell me what's so enjoyable or comical about nuclear war. QUIJANO: Governor Pence? PENCE: Did you work on that one a long time? Because that had a lot of really creative lines in it. KAINE: Well, I'm going to see if you can defend any of it. PENCE: Well, look, I can defend -- I -- I -- I can -- I can make very clear to the American people, after traveling millions of miles as our secretary of state, after being the architect of the foreign policy of this administration, America is less safe today than it was the day that Barack Obama became president of the United States. It's absolutely inarguable. We've weakened America's place in the world. It's been a combination of factors, but mostly it's been a lack of leadership. I mean, I will give you -- and I was in Washington, D.C., on 9/11. I saw the clouds of smoke rise from the Pentagon. KAINE: I was in Virginia where the Pentagon's... PENCE: I know you were. We all lived through that day as a nation. It was heartbreaking. And I want to give this president credit for bringing Osama bin Laden to justice. But the truth is, Osama bin Laden led Al Qaida. Our primary threat today is ISIS. And because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement that would have allowed some American combat troops to remain in Iraq and secure the hard fought gains the American soldier had won by 2009, ISIS was able to be literally conjured up out of the desert, and it's overrun vast areas that the American soldier had won in Operation Iraqi Freedom. My heart breaks for the likes of Lance Cpl. Scott Zubowski. He fell in Fallujah in 2005. He fought hard through some of the most difficult days in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and he paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom and secure that nation. And that nation was secured in 2009. But because Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama failed to provide a status of forces agreement and leave sufficient troops in there, we are back at war. The president just ordered more troops on the ground. We are back at war in Iraq. And Scott Zubowski, whose mom would always come to Memorial Day events in Newcastle, Indiana, to see me, and I'd give her a hug and tell her we're never going to forget her son and we never will, Scott Zubowski and the sacrifices the American soldier made were squandered in Iraq because this administration created a vacuum in which ISIS was able to grow. And a reference to the Iranian deal, the Iranian deal that Hillary Clinton initiated, $150 billion to the radical mullahs in Iran. KAINE: Stopping a nuclear weapons program without firing a shot? PENCE: You didn't stop the nuclear weapons program. PENCE: You essentially... KAINE: Even the Israeli military says it stopped. PENCE: ... guaranteed that Iran will someday become a nuclear power, because there's no limitations once the period of time of the treaty comes off. QUIJANO: Governor Pence, Mr. Trump has proposed extreme vetting of immigrants from parts of the world that export terrorism. But that does not address many of the recent terrorist attacks in the United States, such as the Orlando nightclub massacre and the recent bombings in New York and New Jersey. Those were homegrown, committed by U.S. citizens and legal residents. What specific tools would you use to prevent those kinds of attacks? PENCE: Well, I think it's -- I think it's a great question, Elaine, but it really does begin with us reforming our immigration system and putting the interests, particularly the safety and security of the American people, first. I mean, Donald Trump has called for extreme vetting for people coming into this country so that we don't bring people into the United States who are hostile to our Bill of Rights freedoms, who are hostile to the American way life. But also, Donald Trump and I are committed to suspending the Syrian refugee program and programs and immigration from areas of the world that have been compromised by terrorism. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to increase the Syrian refugee program by 500... KAINE: Elaine, I want to... QUIJANO: Governor, the question was about homegrown. PENCE: Yeah, and so -- but first, you know, let's make sure we're putting the safety and security of the American people first instead of Hillary Clinton expanding the Syrian refugee program... KAINE: Or instead of you violating the Constitution by blocking people based on their national origin rather than whether they're dangerous. PENCE: That's not -- that's absolutely false. KAINE: That's what the Seventh Circuit decided just -- here's the difference, Elaine. PENCE: The Seventh Circuit... KAINE: We have different views on -- on refugee issues and on immigration. Hillary and I want to do enforcement based on, are people dangerous? These guys say all Mexicans are bad. PENCE: That's absolutely false. KAINE: And with respect to refugees, we want to keep people out if they're dangerous. Donald Trump said keep them out if they're Muslim. Mike Pence... KAINE: ... put a program in place to keep them out if they're from Syria. And yesterday an appellate court with three Republican judges struck down the Pence plan... KAINE: ... and said it was discriminatory... PENCE: And those judges -- those judges said... KAINE: We should focus upon danger, not upon discrimination. PENCE: Elaine, to your point, those judges said it was because there wasn't any evidence yet that -- that ISIS had infiltrated the United States. Well, Germany just arrested three Syrian refugees that were connected to ISIS. KAINE: But they told you there's a right way and a wrong way to do it. PENCE: But, look, if you're going to be critical of me on that, that's fair game. I will tell you, after two Syrian refugees were involved in the attack in Paris that is called Paris' 9/11, as governor of the state of Indiana, I have no higher priority than the safety and security of the people of my state. KAINE: But, Governor Pence... PENCE: So you bet I suspended that program. KAINE: But, Governor Pence, I just... PENCE: And I stand by that decision. And if I'm vice president of the United States or Donald Trump is president, we're going to put the safety and security of the American people first. KAINE: Sure. Can we just be clear -- Hillary and I will do immigration enforcement and we'll vet refugees based on whether they're dangerous or not. We won't do it based on discriminating against you from the country you come from or the religion that you practice. PENCE: But the problem with that... KAINE: That is completely antithetical to the Jeffersonian values of... PENCE: Elaine, the director of the FBI, our homeland security, said we can't know for certain who these people are coming from Syria. KAINE: Yes, we can, and when we don't let them know, we don't let them in. PENCE: So -- the FBI... KAINE: When we don't know who they are, we don't let them in. PENCE: The FBI and homeland security said we can't know for certain. You've got to err on the side of the safety and security of the American people, Senator. I understand the... KAINE: By trashing all Syrians or trashing all Muslims? PENCE: ... the U.N. wants us to expand the Syrian refugee program... QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, let me ask you this. Secretary Clinton... PENCE: We're going to put the safety and security of the American people first. QUIJANO: ... has talked about an intelligence surge. QUIJANO: What exactly would an intelligence surge look like? And how would that help identify terrorists with no operational connection to a foreign terrorist organization? KAINE: Intelligence surge is two-thirds, Elaine. It's two things. It's, first, dramatically expanding our intelligence capacities by hiring great professionals, but also we've got some of the best intel and cyber employees in the world right here in the United States working for many of our private sector companies. So it involves increasing our own workforce, but striking great partnerships with some of our cyber and intel experts in the private sector so that we can, consistent with constitutional principles, gather more intelligence. But the second piece of this is really, really important. It also means creating stronger alliances, because you gather intelligence and then you share your intelligence back and forth with allies. And that's how you find out who may be trying to recruit, who may be trying to come to one country or the next. Alliances are critical. That's why Donald Trump's claim that he wants to -- that NATO is obsolete and that we need to get rid of NATO is so dangerous. PENCE: That's not his plan. KAINE: Well, he said NATO is obsolete. And, look, if you put aside -- push aside your alliances, who you're going to share intelligence with? Hillary Clinton is the secretary of state who knows how to build alliances. She built the sanctions regime around the word that stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program. And that's what an intelligence surge means. Better skill and capacity, but also better alliances. QUIJANO: All right. I'd like to turn now to the tragedy in Syria. Two hundred fifty thousand... PENCE: Can I speak about the cybersecurity surge at all? QUIJANO: You can -- you can have 30 seconds, Governor, quickly, please. PENCE: First, Donald Trump just spoke about this issue this week. We have got to bring together the best resources of this country to understand that cyber warfare is the new warfare of the asymmetrical enemies that we face in this country. And I look forward if I'm privileged to be in this role of working with you in the Senate to make sure that we resource that effort. KAINE: We will work together in whatever roles we inhabit. PENCE: We have an intelligence, sir (ph). But I will also tell you that it's important in this moment to remember that Hillary Clinton had a private server in her home that had classified information on it... QUIJANO: And I don't -- 30 seconds is on up. PENCE: ... about drone strikes, e-mails from the president of the United States of America were on there. PENCE: Her private server was subject to being hacked by foreign... QUIJANO: I'd like to ask you about Syria, Governor. PENCE: We could put cybersecurity first if we just make sure the next secretary of state doesn't have a private server. KAINE: And all investigation concluded that not one reasonable prosecutor would take any additional step. You don't get to decide the rights and wrongs of this. We have a justice system that does that. And a Republican FBI director did an investigation and concluded that... (CROSSTALK) QUIJANO: All right, we are moving on now. Two hundred fifty thousand people... PENCE: If your son or my son handled classified information the way Hillary Clinton did... QUIJANO: ... one hundred thousand of them children -- Governor... PENCE: ... they'd be court martialed. KAINE: That is absolutely false and you know that. PENCE: Absolutely true. KAINE: And you know that, Governor. PENCE: It's absolutely true. QUIJANO: Gentlemen, please. KAINE: Because the FBI did an investigation. KAINE: And they concluded that there was no reasonable prosecutor who would take it further. Sorry. QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, Governor Pence, please. QUIJANO: I want to turn now to Syria. Two hundred fifty thousand people, 100,000 of them children, are under siege in Aleppo, Syria. Bunker buster bombs, cluster munitions, and incendiary weapons are being dropped on them by Russian and Syrian militaries. Does the U.S. have a responsibility to protect civilians and prevent mass casualties on this scale, Governor Pence? PENCE: The United States of America needs to begin to exercise strong leadership to protect the vulnerable citizens and over 100,000 children in Aleppo. Hillary Clinton's top priority when she became secretary of state was the Russian reset, the Russians reset. After the Russian reset, the Russians invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea. And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America -- the greatest nation on Earth -- just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins -- look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership. It begins by rebuilding our military. And the Russians and the Chinese have been making enormous investments in the military. We have the smallest Navy since 1916. We have the lowest number of troops since the end of the Second World War. We've got to work with Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world. But about Aleppo and about Syria, I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones, so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas, work with our Arab partners, real time, right now, to make that happen. And secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength. And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo. There's a broad range of other things that we ought to do, as well. We ought to deploy a missile defense shield to the Czech Republic and Poland which Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama pulled back on out of not wanting to offend the Russians back in 2009. QUIJANO: Governor, your two minutes are up. PENCE: We've just got to have American strength on the world stage. When Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, the Russians and other countries in the world will know they're dealing with a strong American president. QUIJANO: Senator Kaine? KAINE: Hillary and I also agree that the establishment of humanitarian zones in northern Syria with the provision of international human aid, consistent with the U.N. Security Council resolution that was passed in February 2014, would be a very, very good idea. And Hillary also has the ability to stand up to Russia in a way that this ticket does not. Donald Trump, again and again, has praised Vladimir Putin. And it's clear that he has business dealings with Russian oligarchs who are very connected to Putin. The Trump campaign management team had to be fired a month or so ago because of those shadowy connections with pro-Putin forces. Governor Pence made the odd claim, he said inarguably Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama. Vladimir Putin has run his economy into the ground. He persecutes LGBT folks and journalists. If you don't know the difference between dictatorship and leadership, then you got to go back to a fifth-grade civics class. I'll tell you what offends me... PENCE: Well, that offended me. KAINE: Governor Pence just said -- Governor Pence just said that Donald Trump will rebuild the military. No, he won't. Donald Trump is avoiding paying taxes. The New York Times story -- and we need to get this -- but the New York Times suggested that he probably didn't pay taxes for about 18 years starting in 1995. Those years included the years of 9/11. So get this. On 9/11, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's hometown was attacked by the worst terrorist attack in the history of the United States. Young men and women -- young men and women signed up to serve in the military to fight terrorism. Hillary Clinton went to Washington to get funds to rebuild her city and protect first responders, but Donald Trump was fighting a very different fight. It was a fight to avoid paying taxes so that he wouldn't support the fight against terror. QUIJANO: The question was about Aleppo, Senator. KAINE: He wouldn't support troops. He wouldn't -- he wouldn't support -- this is important, Elaine. When a guy running for president will not support the troops, not support veterans, not support teachers, that's really important. KAINE: And I said about Aleppo, we do agree the notion is we have to create a humanitarian zone in northern Syria. It's very important. QUIJANO: Governor Pence, you had mentioned no-fly zone. Where would you propose setting up a safe zone specifically? How would you keep it safe? PENCE: Well, first and foremost, Donald Trump supports our troops. Donald Trump supports our veterans. KAINE: He won't pay taxes. PENCE: Donald Trump has paid all the taxes that he's -- do you not take deductions? How does that work? QUIJANO: Gentlemen, this is about Syria. I'd like to... PENCE: Honestly, Senator. Honestly, Senator. KAINE: It is about our troops. It is about our troops. PENCE: I understand why you want to change -- I understand why you want to change the subject. KAINE: How can you support the troops if you won't pay taxes? PENCE: I understand why you want to change the subject. And let me be very clear on this Russian thing. The larger question here... KAINE: Do you think Donald Trump is smart to not pay taxes? QUIJANO: Gentlemen, we're going to have time to get to Russia here. PENCE: What we're dealing with is the -- you know, there's an old proverb that says the Russian bear never dies, it just hibernates. And the truth of the matter is, the weak and feckless foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama has awakened an aggression in Russia that first appeared a few years ago with their move in Georgia, now their move into Crimea, now their move into the wider Middle East. And all the while, all we do is fold our arms and say we're not having talks anymore. To answer your question, we just need American strength. We need to -- we need to marshal the resources of our allies in the region, and in the immediate, we need to act and act now to get people out of harm's way. QUIJANO: And exactly how would those safe zones work? How would they remain safe? PENCE: The -- the safe zones would have to be -- as the senator said, there's already a framework for this that's been recognized by the international community. The United States of America needs to be prepared to work with our allies in the region to create a route for safe passage and then to protect people in those areas, including with a no-fly zone. But, look, this is very tough stuff. I served on the Foreign Affairs Committee for a decade. I traveled in and out of that region for 10 years. I saw what the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom. And to see the weak and feckless leadership that Hillary Clinton was the architect of and the foreign policy of the Obama administration... KAINE: Well, let me -- let me come back... PENCE: ... is deeply troubling to me. That will all change the day Donald Trump becomes president of the United States. KAINE: ... and talk about -- let me talk about the things that Governor Pence doesn't want to acknowledge, Elaine. He doesn't want to acknowledge that we stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program. He doesn't want to acknowledge... KAINE: ... that Hillary was part of a team that got bin Laden. He doesn't want to acknowledge... PENCE: I just did. KAINE: ... that it's a good thing, not a bad thing, that it's a good thing -- not a bad thing -- that we're down from 175,000 troops deployed overseas to 15,000. But let me tell you what will really make the Middle East dangerous. Donald Trump's idea that more nations should get nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea. Ronald Reagan said something really interesting about nuclear proliferation back in the 1980s. He said the problem with nuclear proliferation is that some fool or maniac could trigger a catastrophic event. And I think that's who Governor Pence's running mate is, exactly who Governor Reagan warned us about. PENCE: And come on. Senator. Senator, that was even beneath you and Hillary Clinton. And that -- that's pretty low. KAINE: But do you -- do you think -- do you think we should have -- more nuclear weapons in the world will make us safer? PENCE: Senator, the... KAINE: That's what Donald Trump thinks. PENCE: Ronald Reagan also said nuclear war should never be fought because it can never be won. And the United States of America needs to make investments in modernizing our nuclear force for both deterrence... KAINE: But can you defend Donald Trump's claim that more nations should get nuclear weapons? PENCE: ... and assurance to our allies. But let me go back to this Iran thing. I mean, he keeps saying that they prevented -- that Hillary Clinton started the deal with the Iranians prevented Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. KAINE: That's what the Israeli joint chiefs of staff is saying right now. PENCE: Well, that's not what -- that's not what Israel thinks. KAINE: Gadi Eizenkot, you can go check it. PENCE: You wouldn't necessarily know that. KAINE: Go to the tape. PENCE: I know you boycotted Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech when he came before the Congress. KAINE: No, I visited him in his office. I visited him in his office. PENCE: You boycotted the speech. The point is, what this Iran -- so-called Iran deal did was essentially guarantee -- I mean, when I was in Congress, I fought hard on a bipartisan basis with Republican and Democrat members to move forward the toughest sanctions, it -- literally in the history of the United States, against Iran. KAINE: And then Hillary used them to get a deal. PENCE: We were bringing them to heel, but the goal was always that we would only lift the sanctions if Iran permanently renounced their nuclear ambitions. KAINE: Elaine, let me just mention one thing. PENCE: They have not -- Elaine, let me finish a sentence. They have not renounced their nuclear ambitions. And when the deal's period runs out, there's no limitation on them obtaining weapons. That... QUIJANO: And very quickly, Senator. PENCE: ... and the fact that they got $1.7 billion in a ransom payment... QUIJANO: We need to talk about Russia. Very quickly, though, Senator, please. PENCE: ... is astonishing to the American people. KAINE: Six times tonight, I have said to Governor Pence I can't imagine how you can defend your running mate's position on one issue after the next. And in all six cases, he's refused to defend his running mate. PENCE: Well, let's -- no, no, don't put words in my mouth. KAINE: And yet he is asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend. And I just think that should be underlined. PENCE: No, I'm -- look... QUIJANO: All right, gentlemen, let's talk about Russia. This is a topic that has come up. PENCE: I'm very, very happy to defend Donald Trump. If he wants to take these one at a time, I'll take them one at a time. QUIJANO: I will give you an opportunity to do that. KAINE: More nations should get nuclear weapons. Try to defend that. PENCE: Don't put words in my mouth. Well, he never said that, Senator. KAINE: He absolutely said it. Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan. PENCE: Most of the stuffy you've said, he's never said. QUIJANO: Gentlemen, Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, and has provided crucial military support to the Assad regime. What steps, if any, would your administration take to counter these actions? Senator Kaine? KAINE: You've got to be tough on Russia. So let's start with not praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader. Donald Trump and Mike Pence have said he's a great leader. And Donald Trump has business... PENCE: No, we haven't. KAINE: ... has business dealings -- has business dealings with Russia that he refuses to disclose. Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to- toe with Russia. She went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START Agreement to reduce Russia's nuclear stockpile. She's had the experience doing it. She went toe-to-toe with Russia and lodged protests when they went into Georgia. And we've done the same thing about Ukraine, but more than launching protests, we've put punishing economic sanctions on Russia that we need to continue. Donald Trump, on the other hand, didn't know that Russia had invaded the Crimea. PENCE: Oh, that's nonsense. KAINE: He was on a TV show a couple months back, and he said, ""I'll guarantee you this, Russia's not going into the Ukraine."" And he had to be reminded that they had gone into the Crimea two years before. KAINE: Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to-toe with Russia to work out a deal on New START. She got them engaged on a meaningful way to cap Iran's nuclear weapons program. And yet she stood up to them on issues such as Syria and their invasion of Georgia. You've got to have the ability to do that, and Hillary does. On the other hand, in Donald Trump, you have somebody who praises Vladimir Putin all the time. America should really wonder about a President Trump, who had a campaign manager with ties to Putin, pro- Putin elements in the Ukraine, who had to be fired for that reason. They should wonder -- when Donald Trump is sitting down with Vladimir Putin, is it going to be America's bottom line or is it going to be Donald Trump's bottom line that he's going to be worried about with all of his business dealings? Now, this could be solved if Donald Trump would be willing to release his tax returns, as he told the American public that he would do. And I know he's laughing at this, but every president... PENCE: But what's it got to do with Russia? KAINE: Every president since Richard Nixon has done it, and Donald Trump has said I'm doing business with Russia. The only way the American public will see whether he has a conflict of interest... PENCE: No, he hasn't said that. KAINE: He has, actually. QUIJANO: Senator, your time is up. Governor? PENCE: Well, thanks. I'm just trying to keep up with the insult-driven campaign on the other side of the table. KAINE: You know, I'm just saying facts about your running mate. KAINE: And I know you can't defend. QUIJANO: Senator, please. This is the governor's two minutes. PENCE: I'm happy to defend him, Senator. Don't put words in my mouth that I'm not defending him. PENCE: I'm happy to defend him. Most of what you said is completely false, and the American people know that. KAINE: I'll run through the list of things where you won't defend... PENCE: This isn't the old days where you can just say stuff and people believe it. QUIJANO: Senator, please. This is Governor Pence's two minutes. PENCE: Look, this is the alternative universe of Washington, D.C., versus reality. Hillary Clinton said her number-one priority was a reset with Russia. That reset resulted in the invasion of Ukraine, after they'd infiltrated with what are called little green men, Russian soldiers that were dressing up like Ukrainian dissidents, and then they moved all the way into Crimea, took over the Crimean Peninsula. Donald Trump knew that happened. He basically was saying it's not going to happen again. The truth of the matter is that what you have in the rise of aggressive Russia, which has had -- increased its influence in Iran, that's now -- now because of this deal is on a pathway in the future to obtain a nuclear -- the leading state sponsor of terror in the world in Iran now has a closer working relationship with Russia because of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's foreign policy and $150 billion and sanctions all being lifted. And then, of course, Syria, I mean, it really is extraordinary that -- Syria is imploding. You just asked a very thoughtful question about the disaster in Aleppo. ISIS is headquartered in Raqqa. It is -- ISIS from Raqqa has overrun vast areas that at great sacrifice the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and yet Senator Kaine still sits here, loyal soldier -- I get all that -- in saying that the foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama somehow made the world more secure. I mean, it really is astonishing that on the day... KAINE: We even wiped out the leader of Al Qaida. PENCE: ... on the day that Iran released four American hostages... KAINE: We stopped Iran from getting nuclear weapons. PENCE: ... we delivered $400 million in cash as a ransom payment for Americans held by the radical mullahs in Tehran. QUIJANO: Governor, yesterday, Mr. Trump said... KAINE: And we stopped a nuclear weapons program without a shot. QUIJANO: ... quote, ""Putin has no respect for Hillary Clinton and no respect for Obama."" Why do you think he'll respect a Trump- Pence administration? PENCE: Strength. Plain and simple. KAINE: Business dealings. PENCE: Donald Trump -- that's nonsense. Donald Trump is a strong leader... KAINE: Donald Trump's son says that the Trump organization... PENCE: ... who is going to lead with American strength. QUIJANO: Please, Senator, I'll give you a chance to respond. PENCE: We're going to rebuild our military. And let me -- let me -- this whole Putin thing. Look, America is stronger than Russia. Our economy is 16 times larger than the Russian economy. America's political system is superior to the crony, corrupt capitalist system in Russia in every way. When Donald Trump and I observe that, as I've said in Syria, in Iran, in Ukraine, that the small and bullying leader of Russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administration, that's stating painful facts. That's not an endorsement of Vladimir Putin. That's an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership... QUIJANO: Senator Kaine? PENCE: ... of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. KAINE: Well, this is one where we can just kind of go to the tape on it. But Governor Pence said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama. PENCE: That is absolutely inaccurate. KAINE: And -- and -- and I just think a guy who praises... PENCE: He said he's stronger -- he's been stronger on the world stage. KAINE: No, he said leader. And if -- and I'll just say this, Governor. PENCE: You just said better. KAINE: If you mistake leadership for dictatorship, and you can't tell the difference, a country that's running its economy into the ground... PENCE: Yeah, here we go. This is the grade school thing again? KAINE: ... persecuting journalists... PENCE: Right, this is grade school. KAINE: ... if you can't tell the difference, you shouldn't be commander-in-chief. PENCE: Yeah. KAINE: And with Donald Trump -- Donald Trump's sons say that they have all these business dealings with Russia. Those could be disclosed with tax returns, but they refuse to do them. Americans need to worry about whether Donald Trump will be watching out for America's bottom line or his own bottom line. QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, what went wrong with the Russia reset? KAINE: Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Putin is a dictator. QUIJANO: And what would do you differently? KAINE: Vladimir Putin is a dictator. He's not a leader. Anybody who thinks otherwise doesn't know Russian history and they don't know Vladimir Putin. Hillary Clinton knows exactly who this guy is. John McCain said, I look in his eyes and I see KGB. And Hillary kind of has that same feeling. KAINE: So how do deal with him? You've got to -- we do have to deal with Russia in a lot of different ways. There are areas where we can cooperate. So it was Hillary Clinton who worked with Russia on the New START Treaty to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpile. It was Hillary Clinton that worked with Russia to get them engaged in a community of nations to stop the Iranian nuclear weapons without firing a shot. She's not going around praising Vladimir Putin as a great guy. But she knows how to sit down at a table and negotiate tough deals. This is a very challenging part of the world, and we ought to have a commander-in-chief who is prepared and done it, rather than somebody who goes around praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader. QUIJANO: All right, I'd like to ask now about North Korea, Iran and the threat of nuclear weapons. North Korea recently conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test. QUIJANO: What specific steps would you take to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States? Governor Pence? PENCE: Well, first, we need to -- we need to make a commitment to rebuild our military, including modernizing our nuclear forces. And we also need -- we also need an effective American diplomacy that will marshal the resources of nations in the Asian Pacific Rim to put pressure on North Korea, on Kim Jong-un, to abandon his nuclear ambitions. It has to remain the policy of the United States of America the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, plain and simple. And when Donald Trump is president of the United States, we're -- we're not going to have the -- the kind of posture in the world that has Russia invading Crimea and Ukraine, that has the Chinese building new islands in the South China Sea, that has literally the world, including North Korea, flouting American power. We're going to -- we're going to go back to the days of peace through strength. But I have to tell you that -- that all this talk about tax returns -- and I get it, you know, you want to keep bringing that up. It must have -- must have... PENCE: ... done well in some focus group. But here -- Hillary Clinton and her husband set up a private foundation called the Clinton Foundation. While she was secretary of state, the Clinton Foundation accepted tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments and foreign donors. Now, you all need to know out there, this is basic stuff. Foreign donors, and certainly foreign governments, cannot participate in the American political process. They cannot make financial contributions. But the Clintons figured out a way to create a foundation where foreign governments and foreign donors could donate millions of dollars. And then we found, thanks to the good work of the Associated Press, that more than half her private meetings when she was secretary of state were given to major donors of the Clinton Foundation. When you talk about all these -- all these baseless rumors about Russia and the rest, Hillary Clinton -- you asked the trustworthy question at the very beginning -- the reason... QUIJANO: Governor, your two minutes are up. PENCE: ... the reason the American people don't trust Hillary Clinton is because they are looking at the pay to play politics that she operated with the Clinton Foundation through a private server... QUIJANO: Governor, please. PENCE: ... while she's secretary of state. QUIJANO: Your two minutes are up, Governor. PENCE: And they're saying enough is enough. QUIJANO: Senator Kaine? KAINE: I'm going to talk about the foundation, and then I'll talk about North Korea. So, on the foundation. I am glad to talk about the foundation. The Clinton Foundation is one of the highest- rated charities in the world. It provides AIDS drugs to about 11.5 million people. It helps Americans deal with opioid overdoses. It gets higher rankings for its charity than the American Red Cross does. The Clinton foundation does an awful lot of good work. Hillary Clinton as secretary of state took no action to benefit the foundation. The State Department did an investigation, and they concluded that everything Hillary Clinton did as secretary of state was completely in the interest of the United States. So the foundation does good work. And Hillary Clinton as secretary of state acted in the interests of the United States. But let's compare this now with the Trump organization and the Trump Foundation. The Trump organization is an octopus-like organization with tentacles all over the world whose conflict of interests could only be known if Donald Trump would release his tax returns. He's refused to do it. His sons have said that the organization has a lot of business dealings in Russia. And remember, the Trump organization is not a non-profit. It's putting money into Donald Trump's pockets and into the pockets of his children, whereas the Clinton Foundation is a non- profit and no Clinton family member draws any salary. PENCE: The Trump Foundation is non-profit. KAINE: In addition, Donald Trump has a foundation. The foundation was just fined for illegally contributing foundation dollars to a political campaign of a Florida attorney general. They made an illegal contribution, and then they tried to hide it by disguising it to somebody else. And the person they donated to was somebody whose office was charged with investigating Trump University. This is the difference between a foundation that does good work and a secretary of state who acted in accordance with American interest and somebody who is conflicted and doing work around the world and won't share with the American public what he's doing and what those conflicts are. QUIJANO: Governor, I will give you 30 seconds to respond, because I know you want to, but, again, I would remind you both this was about North Korea. PENCE: Well, Thank you. Thank you. The Trump Foundation is a private family foundation. They give virtually every cent in the Trump Foundation to charitable causes. KAINE: Political contributions? PENCE: Less than ten cents on the dollar in the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes. KAINE: A $20,000 portrait of Donald Trump? PENCE: Less than 10 cents on the dollar of the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes. KAINE: Ninety percent. PENCE: It has been a platform for the Clintons to travel the world, to have staff. But honestly, Senator, we would know a lot more about it if Hillary Clinton would just turn over the 33,000 e-mails... QUIJANO: All right, let's turn back to North Korea... PENCE: ... that she refused to turn over in her private server... QUIJANO: Senator Kaine... PENCE: ... and we'd have a much better picture of what the Clinton Foundation was about. QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, if you had intelligence that North Korea was about to launch a missile, a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States, would you take preemptive action? KAINE: If we -- look, a president should take action to defend the United States against imminent threat. You have to. A president has to do that. Now exactly what action, you would have to determine what your intelligence was, how certain you were of that intelligence, but you would have to take action. You asked the question about how do we deal with a North Korea. I'm on the Foreign Relations Committee. We just did an extensive sanctions package against North Korea. And interestingly enough, Elaine, the U.N. followed and did this -- virtually the same package. Often China will use their veto in the Security Council to veto a package like that. They're starting to get worried about North Korea, too. So they actually supported the sanctions package, even though many of the sanctions are against Chinese firms, Chinese financial institutions. So we're working together with China, and we need to. China's another one of those relationships where it's competitive, it's also challenging, and in times like North Korea, we have to be able to cooperate. Hillary understands that very well. She went once famously to China and stood up at a human rights meeting and looked them in the eye and said, ""Women's rights are human rights."" They didn't want her to say that, but she did. But she's also worked on a lot of diplomatic and important diplomatic deals with China. And that's what it's going to take. The thing I would worry a little bit about is that Donald Trump owes about $650 million to banks, including the Bank of China. I'm not sure he could stand up so tough to the people who have loaned him money. QUIJANO: All right. I'd like to turn to our next segment now. And in this, I'd like to focus on social issues. You have both been open about the role that faith has played in your lives. Can you discuss in detail a time when you struggled to balance your personal faith and a public policy position? Senator Kaine? KAINE: Yeah, that's an easy one for me, Elaine. It's an easy one. I'm really fortunate. I grew up in a wonderful household with great Irish Catholic parents. My mom and dad are sitting right here. I was educated by Jesuits at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City. My 40th reunion is in 10 days. And I worked with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, now nearly 35 years ago, and they were the heroes of my life. I try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life. But I don't believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we don't raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone. For me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I. But I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous. And so I had to grapple with that. When I was running for governor, I was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty. But I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, look, this is my religion. I'm not going to change my religious practice to get one vote, but I know how to take an oath and uphold the law. And if you elect me, I will uphold the law. And I was elected, and I did. It was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I didn't feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did. That was a real struggle. But I think it is really, really important that those of us who have deep faith lives don't feel that we could just substitute our own views for everybody else in society, regardless of their views. QUIJANO: Governor Pence? PENCE: Well, it's a wonderful question. And my Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am. I was also raised in a wonderful family of faith. It was a church on Sunday morning and grace before dinner. PENCE: But my Christian faith became real for me when I made a personal decision for Christ when I was a freshman in college. And I've tried to live that out however imperfectly every day of my life since. And with my wife at my side, we've followed a calling into public service, where we've -- we've tried to -- we've tried to keep faith with the values that we cherish. And with regard to when I struggle, I appreciate, and -- and -- and -- I have a great deal of respect for Senator Kaine's sincere faith. I truly do. KAINE: That's shared. PENCE: But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that -- that ancient principle that -- where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life. The state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives. I'm also very pleased at the fact we're well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America. I think if you're going to be pro-life, you should -- you should be pro- adoption. But what I can't understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion. I mean, to hold to the view -- and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally -- but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me. And I cannot -- I can't conscience about -- about a party that supports that. Or that -- I know you've historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion. But Hillary Clinton wants to -- wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldn't use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion. So for me, my faith informs my life. I try and spend a little time on my knees every day. But it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of every human life. KAINE: Elaine, this is a fundamental question, a fundamental question. Hillary and I are both people out of religious backgrounds, from Methodist church experience, which was really formative for her as a public servant. But we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith. But it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else. So let's talk about abortion and choice. Let's talk about them. We support Roe v. Wade. We support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy. That's something we trust American women to do that. And we don't think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion. Governor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade. He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history. And we have some young people in the audience who weren't even born when Roe was decided. This is pretty important. Before Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy. I think you should live your moral values. But the last thing, the very last thing that government should do is have laws that would punish women who make reproductive choices. And that is the fundamental difference between a Clinton-Kaine ticket and a Trump- Pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice. PENCE: No, it's really not. Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy. KAINE: Then why did Donald Trump say that? PENCE: We just never would. KAINE: Why did he say that? PENCE: Well, look, it's -- look, he's not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton. And so... KAINE: Well, I would admit that's not a polished... PENCE: You know, things don't always come out exactly the way he means them. KAINE: Well, can I say... PENCE: But I'm telling you what the policy of our administration would be. KAINE: Great line from the -- great line from the gospel of Matthew. From the fullness of the heart, the mouth speaks. PENCE: Yeah. KAINE: When Donald Trump says women should be punished or Mexicans are rapists and criminals... PENCE: I'm telling you... KAINE: ... or John McCain is not a hero, he is showing you who he is. PENCE: Senator, you've whipped out that Mexican thing again. He -- look... KAINE: Can you defend it? PENCE: There are criminal aliens in this country, Tim, who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking American lives. KAINE: You want to -- you want to use a big broad brush against Mexicans on that? PENCE: He also said and many of them are good people. You keep leaving that out of your quote. And if you want me to go there, I'll go there. But here's -- there is a choice, and it is a choice on life. I couldn't be more proud to be standing with Donald Trump, who's standing for the right to life. It's a principle that -- Senator Kaine -- and I'm very gentle about this, because I really do respect you -- it's a principle that you embrace. And I have appreciated the fact that you've supported the Hyde amendment, which bans the use of taxpayer funding for abortion, in the past, but that's not Hillary Clinton's view. People need to understand, we can come together as a nation. We can create a culture of life. More and more young people today are embracing life because we know we are -- we're better for it. We can -- like Mother Teresa said at that famous national prayer breakfast... PENCE: ... bring the -- let's welcome the children into our world. There are so many families around the country who can't have children. We could improve adoption... KAINE: But, Governor... PENCE: ... so that families that can't have children can adopt more readily those children from crisis pregnancies. KAINE: Governor, why don't you trust women to make this choice for themselves? We can encourage people to support life. Of course we can. But why don't you trust women? Why doesn't Donald Trump trust women to make this choice for themselves? That's what we ought to be doing in public life. Living our lives of faith or motivation with enthusiasm and excitement, convincing other, dialoguing with each other about important moral issues of the day... PENCE: Because there are... KAINE: ... but on fundamental issues of morality, we should let women make their own decisions. PENCE: Because there is -- a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable, the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn. I believe it with all my heart. And I couldn't be more proud to be standing with a pro-life candidate in Donald Trump. QUIJANO: I do have one final question for you both tonight. It has been a divisive campaign. Senator Kaine, if your ticket wins, what specifically are you going to do to unify the country and reassure the people who voted against you? KAINE: That's a really important one. That may be the $64,000 question, because it has been a divisive campaign. And again, Hillary is running a campaign about stronger together, and Donald Trump -- and this is -- this is not directed at this man, except to the extent that he can't defend Donald Trump -- Donald Trump has run a campaign that's been about one insult after the next. But we do have to bring the country together. So here's what we'll do. Hillary Clinton was first lady, then senator for eight years and secretary of state. And I served in the Senate. And I'm really amazed, Elaine, as I talk to Republican senators, how well they regard and respect Hillary Clinton. She was on the Armed Services Committee. She was on other committees. She worked across the aisle when she was first lady to get the CHIP program passed so that 8 million low-income kids have health insurance in this country, including 150,000 in Indiana. She worked across the aisle after 9/11 to get health benefits for the first responders who bravely went into the towers and into the Pentagon. She worked to get benefits for -- TRICARE benefits for National Guard members, including Hoosiers and Virginians in the National Guard. She has a track record of working across the aisle to make things happen. And, you know, Elaine, I have the same track record. I was a governor of Virginia with two Republican houses. And in the Senate, I have good working relationships across the aisle. Because I think it's fine to be a Democrat or Republican or independent, but after Election Day, the goal is work together. And Hillary Clinton has a track record of accomplishment across the aisle that will enable her to do just that when we work with the new Congress in January. QUIJANO: Governor, how will you unify the country if you win? PENCE: Well, thank you, Elaine, and thanks for a great discussion... PENCE: ... tonight. Thank you, Senator. This is a very challenging time in the life of our nation. Weakened America's place in the world after the leadership of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on the world stage has been followed by an economy that is truly struggling, stifled by an avalanche of more taxes, more regulation, Obamacare, the war on coal, and the kind of trade deals that have put American workers in the back seat. I think the best way that we can bring people together is through change in Washington, D.C. You know, I served in Washington, D.C., for 12 years in the Congress of the United States. And I served with many Republicans and Democrats, men and women of goodwill. The potential is there to really change the direction of this country, but it's going to take leadership to do it. The American people want to see our nation standing tall on the world stage again. They want to see us supporting our military, rebuilding our military, commanding the respect of the world, and they want to see the American economy off to the races again. They want to see an American comeback. And Donald Trump's entire career has been about building. It's been about -- it's going through hardship just like a businessperson does and finding a way through smarts and ingenuity and resilience to fight forward and -- when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, we're going to have a stronger America. When you hear him say he wants to make America great again, when we do that, I truly do believe the American people are going to be standing taller. They're going to see that real change can happen after decades of just talking about it. And when that happens, the American people are going to stand tall, stand together, and we'll have the kind of unity that's been missing for way too long. QUIJANO: All right, gentlemen, thank you so much. This concludes the vice presidential debate. My thanks to the candidates, the commission, and to you for watching. Please tune in this Sunday for the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis and the final debate on October 19th at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. From Farmville, Virginia, I'm Elaine Quijano of CBS News. Good night."	1

""Most people think that's good.""We’ve checked this -- such as during the Dec. 15, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Sioux City, Iowa -- and never found it to be accurate.Gingrich was speaker from January 1995 to January 1999, when he was a Republican congressman from Atlanta’s suburbs.The federal budget runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins October 1 and ends September 30. During fiscal years 1996 and 1997 -- the first two that Gingrich helped shape as speaker -- there were deficits: $107 billion in 1996 and about $22 billion in 1997.By fiscal year 1998, the federal budget did reach a surplus of $69 billion. And in fiscal year 1999 -- which Gingrich can claim some responsibility for, even though he was out as speaker for most of the fiscal year -- it was in surplus as well, to the tune of $126 billion.But that’s only two balanced budgets he can plausibly claim credit for. The federal government did run four consecutive surpluses, but for the last two of those -- fiscal years 2000 and 2001 -- Gingrich was no longer serving in the House.It’s also worth noting that even the two balanced budgets for which Gingrich can claim some credit were collective accomplishments by a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, and the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate.Our rulingGingrich was off-base with this claim -- again. The budget was indeed balanced for four years, but it’s a stretch for him to take credit for anything more than two of those years. We rate Gingrich’s claim False. "	0

""Crazy as it may sound, you MUST include the baby in the overall count of guests in the tour. It’s an easy process.""The newsletter then proceeds to spell out how ""the baby’s security information should be entered"" into the White House system, including such details as: ""GENDER: if the parents know put that gender down if not, you can enter either M or F as we’ll ask you to update it at the time of birth."" All of the information should be updated ""once, the baby is born,"" the newsletter instructs.""It is ironic that President Obama's staff recognizes the existence of unborn babies for purposes of providing security within the White House -- yet, there is no indication that President Obama has any problem with the fact that throughout the District of Columbia, abortion is now legal for any reason up to the moment of birth,” said Douglas Johnson, National Right to Life legislative director. “Notably, the newsletter provides no guidance on what the staff should do if an unborn baby is first registered for security purposes, but then aborted. On May 17, the House Judiciary Constitution Subcommittee plans to hold a hearing on the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R. 3803), which would generally prohibit abortion in the sixth month and later in the District. If the President wants to provide for the security of the unborn child immediately outside of the White House gates, as well as inside, he should endorse this bill.""Further information on the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is available on the NRLC website at http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/Fetal_Pain/index.htmlFounded in 1968, the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC), the federation of 50 state right-to-life affiliates and more than 3,000 local chapters, is the nation's oldest and largest grassroots pro-life organization.

(Ashraf Shazly/AFP/Getty Images)Michael Gerson and Raj Shah are senior fellows with Results for America and the authors of the “ Moneyball for Government ” chapter “Foreign Assistance and the Revolution of Rigor.” Gerson, an opinion columnist for The Washington Post, served as an assistant to President George W. Bush for policy and planning. Shah served as USAID administrator under President Barack Obama.We have entered the era of “America first” with only a vague understanding of its meaning. President Trump’s inaugural address signaled an ambitious nationalist reimagining of the post-World War II international order. Trump’s foreign policy team, in contrast, seems to spring from that order. The resulting uncertainty is global and dangerous. Vacuums of leadership are not generally filled by the good guys.The administration’s policy shift is most evident so far in the areas of trade and refugees — Trump prefers less of both. Given a narrowed conception of national interest and the president’s discomfort with the idea of “nation building,” foreign assistance would seem a natural next target. Persistent rumors that the administration is mulling major cuts at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) have heightened this speculation.Although Trump hasn’t spoken much on this topic, some of his comments have reflected an inclination to pull back. “It is necessary that we invest in our infrastructure, stop sending foreign aid to countries that hate us and use that money to rebuild our tunnels, roads, bridges and schools,” he said when he announced his candidacy. And in a March 2016 interview with the Washington Post editorial board , he said: “I watched as we built schools in Iraq and they’d be blown up. And we’d build another one, and it would get blown up. . . . And yet we can’t build a school in Brooklyn. We have no money for education, because we can’t build in our own country. And at what point do you say, hey, we have to take care of ourselves.”Yet Trump has also added notes of ambiguity. In August, he told the Miami Herald that Congress should increase funding to fight the Zika virus abroad. In September, he underlined the importance of ensuring clean water for everyone in the world. In October, he stated that “ we’re going to lead the way ” on AIDS relief.In this case, Trump’s better angels would do more to serve the country than his budget-cutters. Putting foreign assistance on the chopping block would be a serious mistake, by any definition of the national interest.***Let’s begin by getting the facts straight. Surveys have shown that many Americans assume the country spends upwards of 20 percent of the federal budget on foreign aid. In reality, nonmilitary foreign assistance — including all of America’s work on international development and global health — represents less than 1 percent of the federal budget . Slashing this tiny category of discretionary spending for the sake of budget control would be a form of deception — a sideshow to avoid truly important (and unpopular) budgetary choices.For less than 1 percent of the federal budget, the United States led a global coalition to fight HIV/AIDS when the disease threatened to devastate and destabilize much of the African continent . Battling another of the world’s most lethal killers, malaria , U.S.-led global programs have saved more than 6 million lives, mainly children under 5 years old. America also led a global effort to support agriculture when the food, fuel and financial crisis of 2008 pushed nearly 100 million people back into a state of chronic hunger and extreme poverty. As of 2015, that effort had directly benefited nearly 19 million rural households and reached more than 12 million children with nutrition programs . And America led a global partnership to bring power to half a billion people in Africa who have too often lived, worked, studied and given birth in the dark.This established impact runs up against a durable stereotype: that foreign assistance is routinely bundled in large bills and thrown down rat holes of waste and corruption. The charge is not entirely without historical root. During the Cold War, foreign assistance had some remarkable successes, including the Marshall Plan and the Green Revolution, but also notable failures such as aid to Vietnam and to dictators in Central America. In Africa, assistance sometimes went to strongmen such as Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, mainly because of a strategic chess game against the Soviet Union, not because he was spurring development.But over the past two decades and past two presidential administrations, health and development spending has evolved into a rigorous, innovative and professional enterprise dedicated to measured outcomes. Aid and development practitioners know how to set smart targets, engage private-sector partners, adapt to changing circumstances and make sure taxpayers get the most value for their investments. And they have evidence that what they are doing works.Most U.S. foreign assistance no longer even goes to foreign governments; It is given to U.S. companies and nonprofits in the form of contracts and grants; these organizations then implement projects in other countries, employing a combination of American and foreign staff members and often partnering with institutions of civil society.***But why does this emphasis on rigor and outcomes matter to U.S. foreign policy? How does foreign assistance serve definable American interests?Many of our most dangerous global challenges — such as terrorism, the drug trade and pandemic diseases — gather strength in countries, or regions within countries, that are poorly governed, often corrupt, and marked by high levels of poverty, hunger and disease. These places are incubators of risks to the United States. Consider Ebola, which took root in the weak health systems of West Africa and threatened our nation and the world with death and panic. Or the poverty and conflict in the Northern Triangle of Central America, which led to tens of thousands of child migrants trying to make their way to the United States on the tops of trains . Or the collapse of sovereignty in Syria, which helped produce the Islamic State and a radiating, destabilizing flood of refugees into Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and beyond. Or the weak governments of South America, which are often unable to halt the flow of drugs that enter our country.These are all very real consequences of poverty, instability and poor governance. But gains in hope, health and stability reduce these threats and better protect Americans. A forward-leaning Ebola response, employing America’s full epidemiological and humanitarian capacity, helped save lives in Africa and prevented the outbreak from spreading around the globe. In the Northern Triangle, our partnerships have helped reduce gang violence and stem the flow of unaccompanied minors to the United States. The Syrian crisis continues apace, but our massive humanitarian support for those displaced and in dire need reduces the pressure of refugee migrations to many nations, including our own.One of the best examples of the strategic role of aid has been in Colombia , where criminal gangs, violent conflict and the world’s largest production of cocaine threatened to destabilize the region and the world for decades. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the United States had a large security budget in Colombia and a small budget for development assistance. Then the Colombians embraced a greater focus on long-term development, which they integrated into their stabilization plans when territory was taken back from rebels. U.S. development assistance was increased, then integrated and properly sequenced with defense activities. As soon as landmines were cleared and local officials could safely return to liberated towns, USAID poured in assistance, which was crucial to consolidate gains. Those long-term investments are now paying off, supporting peace negotiations and helping to reintegrate former rebels and displaced civilians, in addition to improving business opportunities for U.S. firms. U.S. foreign assistance in Colombia gave stability and peace a fighting chance, and helped remedy a serious security problem for the United States and its allies.This type of foreign assistance is essential to preventing the kind of uncontainable strategic threats that might eventually require military intervention. (We are not talking here about humanitarian assistance, which should be driven entirely by the nature and scale of the need, or about direct military aid.) Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a compelling case for conflict prevention when he was head of U.S. Central Command: “If you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition.” A small investment in foreign assistance today saves big on defense later.***An “America first” approach to foreign assistance could mean deploying foreign aid even more rigorously to help keep America safe, rather than a simple retreat.How do we create an aid system that uses big data to identify areas of weak governance that may produce global threats? One that systematically employs the full spectrum of assistance? One that uses information on measured outcomes to adjust policies and practices in real time? And one that ultimately builds local capacity to confront problems?There are specific actions the new administration can take to deliver on this vision. It should designate a “coordinator for development” who is empowered to ensure results from U.S. foreign assistance programs. This coordinator could be the new USAID administrator or the secretary of state himself — but it must be someone who sits at the principals table at the National Security Council and has the clear backing of the White House. He or she would need to review existing efforts and determine how they match rising threats. To avoid being just another layer of bureaucracy, such an official should be authorized to move budget resources between the State Department, USAID and the Defense Department as necessary to effectively prevent conflicts. Under these circumstances, aid should be categorized in the budget as national security spending, not “non-defense discretionary” spending. And the Trump national security team should make sure American leadership on these issues remains the bipartisan priority it has been for decades, starting with proposing and defending a strong budget commitment to these efforts right now.The next few months could mark a turning point for foreign assistance, and it matters greatly what kind. We could see the erosion of support for a cost-effective instrument of foreign policy and national influence — and we would see the consequences of such negligence later, probably in the form of military commitments — or we could see a reform that makes foreign assistance a reflection of American ideals and a rigorous instrument of American interests. The latter is a worthy and necessary goal for a great nation.Michael Gerson is a nationally syndicated columnist who appears twice weekly in The Post.	1

We need a flexible system that allows people who have to work full time, like single mothers who are raising children and are working also need flexible ways to go back to school.Perhaps in his eagerness to criticize, Marco neglected to mention his long-time advocacy for and support of for-profit colleges . And Marco neglected to mention that his own proposed college affordability overhaul would specifically benefit for-profit colleges — institutions with a reputation for willfully misleading students, targeting veterans, in particular.Perhaps he forgot to mention his advocacy on behalf of Corinthian Colleges — a school that, according to Bloomberg Politics , “was fined $30 million by the Department of Education for a scheme involving ‘confirmed cases of misrepresentation of job placement rates’ for as many as 947 students.”Perhaps he forgot to mention that — according to Business Insider — his support of for-profit Corinthian Colleges has been a convenient boon for his campaign coffers:Corinthian Colleges, previously one of the largest for-profit colleges before it filed for bankruptcy this spring, gave $5,000 to Rubio’s Reclaim America PAC in 2014, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Perhaps there is a specific reason that Marco Rubio — backed by for-profit colleges — would advocate higher-education reforms that benefit for-profit colleges.Rubio Support For For-Profit CollegesRubio Was A Long-Time Supporter Of “Alternative” Forms Of Higher Education. According to Bloomberg, “But that’s not the full story. Rubio is a noted supporter of ‘alternative’ forms of higher education, describing them in various speeches and statements as a way to help middle class Americans deal with rising tuition costs in an era where college degrees are increasingly vital to success. In 2014, he introduced legislation to encourage federal agencies to hire people with ‘alternative educational experience.” [Bloomberg, 4/29/15 ]Business Insider HEADLINE: “Marco Rubio’s Radical Education Plan Could Benefit One Embattled Type Of College.” [Business Insider, 7/8/15 ]Business Insider: Rubio’s Support Of “Low-Cost, Innovative Providers” Of Education Resembled A “Euphemism For For-Profit Colleges.” According to Business Insider, “Rubio’s push to welcome ‘low-cost, innovative providers’ — which could be a euphemism for for-profit colleges — may raise eyebrows of those familiar with his prior ties to for-profit colleges.” [Business Insider, 7/8/15 ]Rubio’s History Of Helping Corinthian College June 20, 2014: Rubio Wrote A Letter To U.S. Department Of Education Deputy Secretary Expressing Concern Over The “Extreme Financial Constraints” Placed On Corinthian Colleges, Which Restricted The Company’s Access To Federal Financial Aid. According to Bloomberg, “The top-tier Republican presidential candidate had made his plea in a letter—obtained by Bloomberg Politics—dated June 20, 2014 and addressed to Jim Shelton, the deputy secretary of education, and Ted Mitchell, the undersecretary for post-secondary education. ‘It has been brought to my attention that the U.S. Department of Education has recently placed extreme financial constraints on Corinthian Colleges, Inc. by restricting the company’s timely access to federal financial aid. It is my understanding the the [sic] Department of Education has requested extensive documents be provided by Corinthian Colleges for review, and Corinthian has acted in good faith to try to provide these documents as expeditiously as possible,’ Rubio wrote.” [Bloomberg, 4/29/15 ]2014: Rubio Wanted The U.S. Department Of Education To “Demonstrate Leniency” Toward Corinthian Colleges By Allowing The Company Continued Access To Millions In Federal Financial Aid While Undergoing A Federal Investigation. According to Bloomberg, “Last summer, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida asked the U.S. Department of Education to ‘demonstrate leniency’ toward Corinthian Colleges by permitting the wealthy for-profit company to continue accessing millions of dollars in federal financial aid while it was cooperating with a federal investigation.” [Bloomberg, 4/29/15 ]Rubio Was Informed That The Federal Investigation Found “Systemic Deficiencies” In How The Company Operated. According to Bloomberg, “Mitchell responded to Rubio on April 2, explaining that the federal investigation found ‘systemic deficiencies’ in the company’s operations and mentioned that the organization had ‘admitted to falsifying placement rates and/or grade and attendance records at various institutions.” [Bloomberg, 4/29/15 ]Rubio Was Informed That The Company “Admitted To Falsifying Placement Rates And/Or Grade And Attendance Records At Various Institutions.” According to Bloomberg, “Mitchell responded to Rubio on April 2, explaining that the federal investigation found ‘systemic deficiencies’ in the company’s operations and mentioned that the organization had ‘admitted to falsifying placement rates and/or grade and attendance records at various institutions.” [Bloomberg, 4/29/15 ]Corinthian Colleges Reported $1.2 Billion In Federal Student Loans During Its Final Year. According to Bloomberg, “In its final year, Corinthian Colleges reportedly said it received $1.2 billion in federal student loans.” [Bloomberg, 4/29/15 ]Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Dedicated $480 Million In Debt Relief For Students “Harmed By Corinthian’s Predatory Lending Scheme.” According to Bloomberg, “In February, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced $480 million in debt relief for students it deemed were ‘harmed by Corinthian’s predatory lending scheme.” [Bloomberg, 4/29/15 ]Rubio’s Financial Support From Corinthian College2015: Rubio Accepted Contribution From Corinthian Executive Mark Pelesh After Shuttering Campuses. According to Bloomberg, “The most recent donation appeared in the Republican presidential candidate’s filing with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday: a $2,700 maximum from Mark Pelesh, who was listed as a ‘business executive’ forCorinthian Colleges. The donation came on April 30, one day after Bloomberg reported that Rubio had written a June 20, 2014 letter to the Department of Education asking it to ‘demonstrate leniency’ in maintaining Corinthian’s access to federal student loans as it was under investigation. In April 2015, the Department fined the chain $30 million for misrepresenting grades, attendance and job placement data of its students, which led to the chain shutting down its campuses and displacing about 16,000 students across the country.” [Bloomberg, 7/16/15 ]2010 – 2015: Rubio Accepted $27,600 In Donations From Corinthian Colleges. According to Bloomberg, “In the last five years, Florida Senator Marco Rubio’s various political operations have accepted $27,600 in contributions from Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit education chain that shut down in April after a federal investigation found it had engaged in ‘predatory’ practices.” [Bloomberg, 7/16/15 ]For-Profit Colleges’ History Of Targeting VeteransFor-Profit Colleges Receive Largest Share Of Military Educational Benefit Programs. According to a report by Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, “For-profit colleges also receive the largest share of military educational benefit programs: 37 percent of post-9/11 GI bill benefits and 50 percent of Department of Defense Tuition Assistance benefits flowed to for-profit colleges in the most recent period. Because of the cost of the programs however, they trained far fewer students than public colleges. Eight of the top 10 recipients of Department of Veterans Affairs post-9/11 GI bill funds are for-profit education companies.” [United States Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, “For Profit Higher Education: The Failing to Safeguard the Federal Investment and Ensure Student Success, 7/30/2012]For-Profit Colleges Targeted Students Who Were “Often Not Familiar With Traditional Higher Education And May Be Facing Difficult Circumstances In Their Lives.” According to a report by Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, “For-profit colleges seek to enroll a population of non-traditional prospective students who are often not familiar with traditional higher education and may be facing difficult circumstances in their lives. Recruiting materials indicate that at some for-profit colleges, admission representatives were trained to locate and push on the pain in students’ lives. They were also trained to ‘overcome objections’ of prospective students in order to secure enrollments. Additionally, companies trained recruiters to create a false sense of urgency to enroll and inflate the prestige of the college.” [United States Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, “For Profit Higher Education: The Failing to Safeguard the Federal Investment and Ensure Student Success, 7/30/2012]For-Profit Colleges Aggressively Targeted Veterans And Servicemembers, Sometimes With Misleading Or False Information. According to a report by Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, “Servicemembers, veterans, spouses, and family members have become highly attractive prospects to for-profit colleges, and many schools have put significant resources into recruiting and enrolling students eligible for these benefits. Lead generation Web sites, specifically designed to attract members of the military and veterans, use layouts and logos similar to official military websites, but do not inform users that the purpose of the site is to collect contact information on behalf of the site’s for-profit college clients. Internal documents show that some schools’ pursuit of military benefits led them to recruit from the most vulnerable military populations, sometimes recruiting at wounded warrior centers and veterans hospitals. In addition to aggressively seeking military personnel, the investigation showed that some recruiters misled or lied to service members as to whether their tuition would be fully covered by military benefits.

I’m not that worried about the issue of costs. Yes, the Congressional Budget Office’s preliminary cost estimates for Senate plans were higher than expected, and caused considerable consternation last week. But the fundamental fact is that we can afford universal health insurance — even those high estimates were less than the $1.8 trillion cost of the Bush tax cuts. Furthermore, Democratic leaders know that they have to pass a health care bill for the sake of their own survival. One way or another, the numbers will be brought in line. The real risk is that health care reform will be undermined by “centrist” Democratic senators who either prevent the passage of a bill or insist on watering down key elements of reform. I use scare quotes around “centrist,” by the way, because if the center means the position held by most Americans, the self-proclaimed centrists are in fact way out in right field. What the balking Democrats seem most determined to do is to kill the public option, either by eliminating it or by carrying out a bait-and-switch, replacing a true public option with something meaningless. For the record, neither regional health cooperatives nor state-level public plans, both of which have been proposed as alternatives, would have the financial stability and bargaining power needed to bring down health care costs. Whatever may be motivating these Democrats, they don’t seem able to explain their reasons in public. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Thus Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska initially declared that the public option — which, remember, has overwhelming popular support — was a “deal-breaker.” Why? Because he didn’t think private insurers could compete: “At the end of the day, the public plan wins the day.” Um, isn’t the purpose of health care reform to protect American citizens, not insurance companies? Mr. Nelson softened his stand after reform advocates began a public campaign targeting him for his position on the public option. And Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota offers a perfectly circular argument: we can’t have the public option, because if we do, health care reform won’t get the votes of senators like him. Honestly, I don’t know what these Democrats are trying to achieve. Yes, some of the balking senators receive large campaign contributions from the medical-industrial complex — but who in politics doesn’t? If I had to guess, I’d say that what’s really going on is that relatively conservative Democrats still cling to the old dream of becoming kingmakers, of recreating the bipartisan center that used to run America. But this fantasy can’t be allowed to stand in the way of giving America the health care reform it needs. This time, the alleged center must not hold. A version of this op-ed appears in print on , on Page A21 of the New York edition with the headline: Health Care Showdown.	1

The answer to this question is really simple. Because of our students. They are the reason why our educational program has to be of the highest and top quality. This is simply because we want nothing but the best for our students.
