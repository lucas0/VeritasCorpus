  One of the best loved Christmas music is the song “God rest ye merry, gentlemen.” The lyrics are quite odd as we study it.
 </p>
 <p>
  God rest ye merry, gentlemen
  <br>
   Let nothing you dismay
   <br/>
   Remember, Christ, our Saviour
   <br/>
   Was born on Christmas day
   <br/>
   To save us all from Satan’s power
   <br/>
   When we were gone astray
   <br/>
   O tidings of comfort and joy,
  </br>
 </p>
 <p>
  It is a song that depicts the gospel — Christ came, destroy the works of the devil and now we can rest and have comfort and joy — thus we say MERRY CHRISTMAS, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  Wrong if you trace the real meaning of the word merry in old english. In Old English the word merry could mean happy but it is also used in place of the word mighty. Examples would be Robin Hood’s merry (mighty) men. The merry men were not some happy go lucky bunch but were men that King Richards fear.
 </p>
 <p>
  The nation of Great Britain was called “Merry Old England” — which was a powerful nation back then.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sentence EAT, DRINK and BE MERRY was used during war times when soldiers would have to eat and drink because tomorrow they conquer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus knowing the origin of the words would make our Christmas different. Knowing the true meaning of Christmas is pretty much huge.

  Merry is not Santa Clause and all things cute about Christmas
 </p>
 <p>
  Merry is MIGHTY. It is when Jesus came down on earth, born in a manger, grew up as a carpenter and was laser focused on his mission — to destroy the works of the devil and to save mankind from sin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that is Merry Mighty Christmas!!!!

  You have heard it said, “Things aren’t always what they appear to be.” Well, when we sing the Christmas carol, God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen, this saying is certainly true. With the changing of word meanings and difference in cultures, it is hard for Americans today to understand what the English peasants were singing about 500 years

  you know the story behind the song.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 15th century church sang only dark, somber songs usually written in Latin. When Christmas rolled around each year, songs of joy and happiness were not allowed in the church. To overcome this problem, the people took the singing of Christmas songs to the streets of jolly old London town. Soon, the waites, the night watchmen of that time, would be singing God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen as they walked the streets of London.

  Even Charles Dickens would include the song in his classic
  <i>
   A Christmas Carol
  </i>
  . This song was popular with the people because of a very strong
  <nobr>
   message — one

  we desperately need today. Each Christmas, we greet each other with the word merry, meaning happy. Back in the Middle Ages, the word “merry” meant great and mighty. For example, Robin Hood’s merry men might be better understood as mighty men. Then, there’s the word “rest.” The meaning back then was keep or make. These original meanings would be clearer today with the addition of a modern comma. Thus, the true meaning of the song is “God make you mighty, gentlemen,” which is a message for back then and a message for today.

  So many, at Christmas time, will never hear or see the true reason for this holiday which is Christ’s birth. The activities, the distractions, the lack of time and money, will rob most of this important message. They will be deceived into thinking it’s just another Merry Christmas, and the New Year will bring more heartache and pain. We, as mighty men and women, can make a difference this Christmas by living our faith before them. Amid the holly and the tinsel, we can tell them that Christ was born to die and that, in Him, we might live forever. God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen is more than just a Christmas carol. It’s our rallying song to show the world that, at Christmas time, things aren’t always what they appear to be.
