  Rumors of a monster catfish living in the Mississippi River have been told for generations by natives up and down the mighty waterway that divides the Western U.S. from the East.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although most simply enjoy telling their version of the story, many claim to have actually seen it, yet some never believed it to be true.

 <p>
  The catfish weighed in at 736 lbs. Experts say the fish, a Mekong giant catfish, was around 170 years old and never seen in this part of the world.
