  a message reporting former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee had created a guide to identifying a secret homosexual handshake:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Were you just propositioned by a homosexual? You may have been and not even know it! Use
   <nobr>
    Gov. Mike
   </nobr>
   Huckabee’s handy guide to the secret mating ritual used by all homosexuals and be sure next time. You’re welcome!

  Although the specific origins of the “secret handshake” image are unknown, it had been circulating on the Internet since at least 2006. One of the earliest instances of its reproduction appeared on the
  <i>

  <a href="http://www.nakedauthors.com/2006/07/senior-year.html" target="_blank">
   blog
  </a>
  , in an article about a writer’s struggle to get published. At that time, the image was simply described as showing a secret handshake, not a secret “homosexual” handshake:

 </p>

  The image became associated with homosexuals when it was reposted by the satirical

  <a href="http://www.landoverbaptist.org/thestaff/ladies/bowers.html" target="_blank">
   web site
  </a>
  in a “Gay Pride Action Alert” that urged readers to “Call a Baptist Pastor Immediately If You’ve Experienced the Following Secret Invitation.” The image was amended yet again to include Governor Mike Huckabee when it was posted to Facebook page of
  <nobr>
   Mrs. Betty
  </nobr>
  Bowers.
