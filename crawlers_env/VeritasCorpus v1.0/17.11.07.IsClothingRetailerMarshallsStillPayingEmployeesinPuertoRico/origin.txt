  I have to mention this because a lot of people may not know. Marshalls stores in Puerto Rico have kept paying employees even without their stores running. I was worried about my son and he told me, “Calm down dad Marshalls has been paying us” and has been giving them supplies. Thanks to Marshalls stores for such an honorable gesture. From now on I’ll be supporting this chain even more. Marshalls you did great!
