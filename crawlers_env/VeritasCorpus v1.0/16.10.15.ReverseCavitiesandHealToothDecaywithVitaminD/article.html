  , he opened his article with this questionable statement about reversing tooth decay through the use of Vitamin D:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Cavities are a type of tooth decay that occur when specific types of bacteria produce acid that destroys the tooth’s enamel as well as the underlying layer, the dentin. Many people believe that once tooth decay sets in, it’s impossible to reverse it, but the truth is, there are several ways to naturally reverse cavities.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to a study published in the British Medical Journal, cavities and tooth decay can potentially be reversed with diet. The study divided 62 children with cavities into three diet groups. Group 1 ate a standard diet plus oatmeal, which is rich in phytic acid. Group 2 ate a normal diet and supplemented with Vitamin D, while Group 3 ate a grain-free diet and also took Vitamin D.
  </p>
  <p>
   Researchers found that Group 1, who had a diet high in grains and phytic acid, had an increase in cavities. Group 2 showed improvements in cavities, while Group 3, who followed a grain-free diet with nutrient-rich foods and a Vitamin D supplement, saw the greatest improvements. Nearly all of the cavities in Group 3’s participants were healed.

  The claims of “reversing” tooth decay were misrepresented with before-and-after photographs of a tooth exhibiting a deep cavity that was seemingly restored to its original pristine state, which were also used as the featured image when the post was shared on social media:
