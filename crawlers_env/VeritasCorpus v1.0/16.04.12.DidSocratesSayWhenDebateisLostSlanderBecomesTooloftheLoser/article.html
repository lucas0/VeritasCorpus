  <p>
   Socrates, as we know, wrote nothing. His life and ideas are known to us through direct accounts – writings either by contemporaries ( Aristophanes) or disciples ( Plato and Xenophon) – and through indirect accounts, the most important of which is the one written by Aristotle, who was born fifteen years after Socrates’ death (399). Because these accounts vary greatly from one another, the question arises as to whether it is possible to reconstruct the life and – more importantly – the ideas of the historical Socrates on the basis of one, several, or all of these accounts.

  At some point around 2010, with the rise of quote-sharing through social media, the following piece of wisdom became widely attributed to Socrates:

  So far as we can tell, the phrase “when the debate is lost, slander becomes the tool of the loser” emerged roughly around 2008 and appears to have no traceable history prior to that. Despite its popularity on social media, no one has ever found a single direct link to any material attributed to Socrates matching the quote. Its abrupt appearance and lack of historical support suggests that Socrates’ signature was tacked to the commentary to give it an air of ancient wisdom.
