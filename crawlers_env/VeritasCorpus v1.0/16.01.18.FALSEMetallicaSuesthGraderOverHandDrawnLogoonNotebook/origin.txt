  The case against 13-year-old Willy Yang was filed after the band discovered a photo of the notebook in question on Yang’s Instagram account with the caption “No one listens to REAL music anymore #metallica #entersandman #boredatschool.”

  “We’ve been keeping on eye on Mr. Yang for quite some time,” said Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich in prepared remarks. “He knows he looks like an innocent little kid and he uses that to his advantage. But this isn’t the first time he has infringed on Metallica’s intellectual property. Just last month he used some of our lyrics in an essay about Ernest Hemingway. This shows a pattern of plagiarism and disrespect for U.S. copyright law, and we will seek damages.”
