   Dear Terrorist-Bitch,
  </br>
 </p>
 <p>
  We are writing to you as the newly organized Neighborhood Town Watch. We understand that you currently wear a scarf on your head and we would like to put you on notice that this will no longer be tolerated in our neighborhood.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that America is great again, we would like to offer you two opportunities to avoid any consequences on your poor previous decisions. First, you can take your radical attire of and live like all Americans. Or, your second option, you can go back to the God Forsaken land you came from.
 </p>
 <p>
  America is Great Again,
 </p>
 <p>
  Neighborhood Town Watch
