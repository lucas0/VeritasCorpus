  On 28 October 2016, the hashtag #DraftOurDaughters began trending on Twitter, vaguely connected with purportedly “leaked” ads produced by Hillary For America (an arm of the Hillary Clinton campaign).
 </p>
 <p>
  #DraftOurDaughters appeared in the early hours of 28 October 2016, quickly becoming popular. Dozens of official looking images boasted a pro-war position, and one popular purported tweet from Clinton was circulated widely:

  The depicted tweet appeared to exist only in screenshot form, and was not anywhere to be found on Hillary Clinton’s account. The tweet from Twitter user “@alishabae69” was the first ever published by that account, which was created in October 2016 and consisted solely of #DraftOurDaughters content.

  The avatar for that account appeared to be

  from a widely circulated image of a woman named Alena Ushkova. The photograph was first published in 2014, and apparently

  “, covering the hashtag as a legitimate Clinton campaign effort.
 </p>
 <p>
  That article was clearly marked as an unvetted “community” submission, and contained obviously satirical content:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I wonder what Donald will have to say about this one… I’m sure my wife would be proud to stand up to Russia’s homophobic and Christian ways. #ImWithHer #EnlistForHillary #DraftOurDaughters

    Remember to vote November 12th!

  It didn’t take all that much digging to discover #DraftOurDaughters was the work of Clinton opponents, as commenters on the subreddit

  The #DraftOurDaughters hashtag was not an official Hillary Clinton campaign effort. The trend originated on

  Clinton has gone on record supporting legislation to include women in the draft, but has also clarified that she favors an all-volunteer
