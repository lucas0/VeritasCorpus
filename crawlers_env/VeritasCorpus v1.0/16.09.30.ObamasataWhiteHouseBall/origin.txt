  [In] this contest, your task is to show us what the world would be like if it were ruled by pimps and players. In other words, depict mundane ordinary people and things â€” doctors, grandparents, videogames, etc., if the world were run by pimps (and everyone was one).

  The rules of the game are thus: Show what the world would look like if it were ruled by pimps and players. You can depict people, things (i.e. a tricked out funeral home) basically anything in a world where pimps rule.
