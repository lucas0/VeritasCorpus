  A teenage boy and girl were in stable condition after their fingers were severed during a game of tug-of-war at South El Monte High School.
 </p>
 <p>
  The accident happened during a lunchtime spirit week celebration at the school.

  “They wrapped the rope around their hands and somehow the rope when on to snap, I guess it created some extra tension and caused the injuries,” Los Angeles County Fire Inspector Brian Riley said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Students “cheered at first because they thought it was funny that the rope broke, but then they realized what really happened,” freshman Allene Garcia said.
 </p>
 <p>
  The victims were identified by classmates as Edith Rodriguez and Pablo Ocegueda.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They were just both in shock, staring at their hands. They didn’t know what to do,” Jennifer Jiminez, also a freshman, said.
