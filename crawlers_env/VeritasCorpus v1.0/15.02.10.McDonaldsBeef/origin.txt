  Is it true that McDonald’s created a company called “100% Australian Beef” just so they can say that in their advertising?

 <p>
  No. The beef that we use comes from Australian farms. McDonald’s Australia only ever uses premium, export quality beef. Our patties are made by two companies; OSI Foods and Australian Food Corporation.
