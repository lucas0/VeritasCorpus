  On 6 May 2013, 64-year-old Alabama attorney James Porter assumed the presidency of the National Rifle Association (NRA). As

   described
  </a>
  by CBS News, Porter brought with him to that office a “history of controversial rhetoric,” including the following:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Porter has called President Barack Obama a “fake president,” Attorney General Eric Holder “rabidly un-American” and the U.S. Civil War the “War of Northern Aggression.” [H]e repeated his call for training every U.S. citizen in the use of standard military firearms, to allow them to defend themselves against tyranny.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gun control advocates say Porter makes outgoing NRA President David Keene look like a moderate on gun issues, even though Keene had said the NRA would try to punish lawmakers who voted in favor of expanded background checks and other gun control measures.

  On 5 May 2013, the
  <em>
   Free Wood Post
  </em>
  riffed on that subject in an

   article
  </a>
  about Porter in which it quoted him as asserting that “it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “I’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”
  </p>
  <p>
   When asked to clarify Porter said, “I don’t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean.
   <strong>
    In fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again
   </strong>
   .”
