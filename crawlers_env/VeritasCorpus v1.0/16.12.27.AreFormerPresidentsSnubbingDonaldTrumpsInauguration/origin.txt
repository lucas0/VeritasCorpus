 <p>
  SNUB! Former Presidents Refuse To Attend Trump’s Inauguration
 </p>
 <p>
  In what amounts to a snub of
  <em>
   presidential proportions
  </em>
  , three of the four living ex-U.S. Presidents might not be going to Donald Trump’s inauguration.
 </p>
 <p>
  So far, President Jimmy Carter is the only one who confirmed he will be attending.
