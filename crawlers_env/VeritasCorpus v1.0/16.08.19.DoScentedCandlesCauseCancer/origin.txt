  It is important to note that this [EPA study is a] 2001 review of candles and incense stated that “the primary constituent of public health concern in candle emissions is lead.” At the time, lead wicks were still found in some candles coming from China, which were indeed a health concern. Members of the National Candle Association, who account for some 90 percent of all candles made in the US, had voluntarily discontinued the use of lead wicks in the 1970s due to health concerns, and the US Consumer Product Safety Commission formally banned them from the U.S. marketplace in 2003.
