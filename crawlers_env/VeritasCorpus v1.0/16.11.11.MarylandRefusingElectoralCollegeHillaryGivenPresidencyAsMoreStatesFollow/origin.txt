  In a breaking news story, NBC News has just reported that Maryland officially became the first state to approve a plan to give its electoral votes for president to the winner of the national popular vote instead of the candidate chosen by state voters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Former Democratic Presidentail candidate, and Hillary Clinton ally, Martin O’Malley signed the measure into law just one day after the state’s General Assembly adjourned.
 </p>
 <p>
  The order would mean that Maryland’s 10 electoral votes would be awarded to the winner of the national popular vote, which is currently Hillary Clinton while all of the votes are still being counted. Democrats are aggressively trying to take away Donald Trump’s victory by essentially staging a coup. They are trying to sidestep our Constitution and tear down our Democratic process because they do not like the outcome of the election.
