  So, I’m driving to my office to turn in my weekly paperwork. A headlight is out. I see a Tucson Police Department squad vehicle turn around and follow me. I’m already preparing for the stop.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lights go on and I pull over. The officer asks me how I’m doing, and then asks if I have any weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yes, sir. I’m a concealed carry permit holder and my weapon is located on my right hip. My wallet is
  <span class="text_exposed_show">
   in my back-right pocket.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  The officer explains for his safety and mine, he needs to disarm me for the stop. I understand, and I unlock the vehicle. I explain that I’m running a 7TS ALS holster but from the angle, the second officer can’t unholster it. Lead officer asks me to step out, and I do so slowly. Officer relieves me of my Glock and compliments the X300U I’m running on it. He also sees my military ID and I tell him I’m with the National Guard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lead officer points out my registration card is out of date but he knows my registration is up to date. He goes back to run my license. I know he’s got me on at least two infractions. I’m thinking of how to pay them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Officers return with my Glock in an evidence back, locked and cleared. “Because you were cool with us and didn’t give us grief, I’m just going to leave it at a verbal warning. Get that headlight fixed as soon as possible.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I smile. “Thank you, sir.”
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m a black man wearing a hoodie and strapped. According to certain social movements, I shouldn’t be alive right now because the police are allegedly out to kill minorities.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe…just maybe…that notion is bunk.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe if you treat police officers with respect, they will do the same to you.
 </p>
 <p>
  Police officers are people, too. By far and large, most are good people and they’re not out to get you.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’d like to thank those two officers and TPD in general for another professional contact.
 </p>
 <p>
  We talk so much about the bad apples who shouldn’t be wearing a badge. I’d like to spread the word about an example of men who earned their badges and exemplify what that badge stands for.

  [EDIT: In my rush to post, I accidentally omitted that my wallet was in the back-right pocket, near my firearm. This was the primary motivation for temporary disarmament. The post has been modified to reflect that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Again, I’d like to thank the TPD and their officers for their consistent professionalism, courtesy, and the good work that they do, both in this particular contact and every day.]
