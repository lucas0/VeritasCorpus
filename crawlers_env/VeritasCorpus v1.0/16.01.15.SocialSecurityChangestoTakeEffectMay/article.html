  In October 2015,
  <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1314" target="_blank">
   HR 1314
  </a>
  , also known as the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, was passed by Congress.  That legislative bill called for some modifications to the Social Security program which are to take effect on 1 May 2016.  As usual some unscrupulous finance-related businesses  seized upon those modifications to scare gullible readers into signing up for hefty financial newsletter subscriptions in order to protect themselves from Congress’ supposed “hidden radical reform that threatens the financial security of as many as 21.3 million Americans.”

  In fact, the pending changes are relatively minor: they do not take away any existing benefits or alter core Social Security benefits or payment levels, they are not “hidden” or “radical,” and they do not “threaten the financial security” of millions of Americans.  The coming changes will alter or eliminate a few

  used by some people to maximize their Social Security benefits, however, so those in a position to take advantage of them while they still exist need to know how they can be “grandfathered” in.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first change applies to Social Security’s “file and suspend” strategy, which allowed couples to maximize their combined benefits by having one spouse file for Social Security upon reaching full retirement age (currently 66), then immediately suspending the benefits. This allowed the other spouse to claim a spousal benefit while their deferred Social Security grew 8 percent per year until age 70:

   The file-and-suspend strategy will no longer work after May 1, 2016. At that time, a person must file for Social Security and actually receive benefits in order for a husband or wife to get a spousal benefit.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, for those who are at least 66 or who will turn 66 by April 30, 2016, there is still an opportunity to get in under the old file-and-suspend system. Those who do squeak in under the deadline will be grandfathered in under the old file-and-suspend rules.
