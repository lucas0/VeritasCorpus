  Most of the money cannot have gone to Ryan’s campaign committee — the most that committee could legally receive is $10,800 — $5400
  <a href="http://classic.fec.gov/pages/brochures/citizens.shtml" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   from each
  </a>
  of the husband and wife Kochs.

  Each could also give $237,000 (or $474,000 for the two of them) — the maximum allowable — to the NRCC — the Congressional Campaign arm of the Republican party, presumably to be used in races other than, or in addition to, Ryan’s own.
 </p>
 <p>
  The remainder appears to have gone to Prosperity Action, Ryan’s Leadership PAC — probably $5000 from each of them. The Leadership PAC can only give to other candidates.
