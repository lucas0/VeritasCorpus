  A 25-year-old Singaporean woman is recovering in hospital after an attempted prank involving a photocopier backfired painfully for her yesterday afternoon.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to local media reports, the woman was dared by her friends to strip naked and run inside a convenience store in Bishan. Once inside, she was to take a photocopy of her breasts using the store’s machine…
 </p>
 <p>
  …According to the clerk, there was a moment of silence as the copier’s beam scanned across the woman’s breasts. This was followed by a howl of pain…
 </p>
 <p>
  “Her breasts were bright red,” he told journalists. “The beam of light from the copier must have burned them.”
