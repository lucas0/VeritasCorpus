  On 3 May 2016, a screenshot of a WXTF article circulated on social media, apparently confirming Elsa from the popular movie
  <em>
   Frozen
  </em>
  would be paired with a “female love interest” in an upcoming sequel to the film.

 <p>
  As the above-reproduced example demonstrated, the screenshot came from a legitimate news site and appeared to be unaltered. That was true to a point, as a search of the outlet revealed: On 3 May 2016 WXTF published an
  <a href="http://www.fox29.com/news/136408423-story" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  titled “Fans petition for Frozen’s Elsa to have female love interest in sequel,” and the headline was either inadvertently or purposely shortened to read “Elsa to have female love interest in sequel”:

  The article detailed a fan campaign aimed at Disney, seeking a same-sex storyline for Elsa:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Fans have taken to social media to petition for Disney to give “Frozen’s” lead character Princess Elsa a female love interest in the film’s sequel.
  </p>
  <p>
   The hashtag #GiveElsaAGirlfriend began trending on Monday as many Twitter users voiced their support for a gay character in the Disney movie. However, not everyone was supportive of the idea.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  However, the headline was false. Disney confirmed a
  <em>
   Frozen
  </em>
  sequel in March, but no information has suggested Elsa will be paired with a fellow princess (or any other woman).
