 <p>
  President Barack Obama abruptly walked out of a stormy debt-limit meeting with congressional leaders, a dramatic setback to the already shaky negotiations.
 </p>
 <p>
  “He shoved back and said ‘I’ll see you tomorrow,’ and walked out,” House Majority Leader Eric Cantor
  <nobr>
   (R-Va.)
  </nobr>
  told reporters in the Capitol after the meeting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Democratic sources dispute Cantor’s version of Obama’s walk out, but all sides agree that the two had a blow up. The sources described Obama as “impassioned” but said he didn’t exactly storm out of the room.
