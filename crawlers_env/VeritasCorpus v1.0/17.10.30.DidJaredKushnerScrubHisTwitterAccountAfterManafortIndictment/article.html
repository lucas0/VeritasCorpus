  As the indictments rolled, Twitter users falsely accused Jared Kushner of trying to hide his footprints on social media.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shortly after news broke on 30 October 2017 that President Trump’s former campaign chairman
  <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/30/manafort-surrender-fbi-authorities-244305" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   Paul Manafort
  </a>
  and longtime associate Rick Gates had been indicted on a variety of charges, a rumor started circulating that the Senior White House Advisor had scrubbed his Twitter account in an apparent attempt to cover-up any incriminating messages:

   This rumor is solely based on the fact that Jared Kushner’s

  The account @JaredKushner does truly belong to President Trump’s son-in-law. However, Kushner did not delete any tweets after the Manafort indictments came out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kushner has been on Twitter for several years but he has rarely, if ever used the service. In March 2017,

   noted
  </a>
  how odd it was for the new head of the White House Office of American Innovation to be so unfamiliar with the social media service:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Jared Kushner, son-in-law and Senior White House Adviser to President Donald Trump, is, according to
   <em>
    The Washington Post
   </em>
   <em>
    ,
   </em>
   leading the brand new White House Office of American Innovation, which will be devoted to modernizing the federal government with ideas plucked form the world of business.
  </p>
  <p>
   It will have a special focus on technology and data.
  </p>
  <p>
   To better understand how Kushner sees the role innovation can play in modernizing government, we dug up the former real estate mogul and
   <em>
    New York Observer
   </em>
   publisher’s Twitter account.
  </p>
  <p>
   Oh. Wait.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kushner, who has a verified Twitter account with 37,000 followers and joined the platform in 2009 (that’s eight years ago), has never tweeted.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Kushner’s Twitter page has been
  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20171010114801/https:/twitter.com/jaredkushner" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   archived
  </a>
  several times by the Internet Wayback Machine and it doesn’t appear that Kushner posted anything since
  <em>
   Mashable’s
  </em>
  March 2017 article.
 </p>
 <p>
  In other words, Kushner didn’t “scrub” his account because there was nothing to scrub.
 </p>
 <p>
  It appears that Kushner has only posted a few messages to Twitter since joining the service. An archived version of Kushner’s page from

  Both of these messages were
