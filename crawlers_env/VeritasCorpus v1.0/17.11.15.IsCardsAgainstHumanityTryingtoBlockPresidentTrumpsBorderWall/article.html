  , “Cards Against Humanity Saves America,” which claimed that the first of six “America-saving surprises” would be a map of a vacant plot of land that the company had purchased on the U.S.-Mexico border as a way to slow down or stop the construction of a border wall, one of President Donald Trump’s key campaign promises:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY STOPS THE WALL
  </p>
  <p>
   Donald Trump is a preposterous golem who is afraid of Mexicans. He is so afraid that he wants to build a twenty-billion dollar wall that everyone knows will accomplish nothing. So we’ve purchased a plot of vacant land on the border and retained a law firm specializing in eminent domain to make it as time-consuming and expensive as possible for the wall to get built.
  </p>
  <p>
   On Day 1, all Cards Against Humanity Saves America recipients will get an illustrated map of the land, a certificate of our promise to fight the wall, some new cards, and a few other surprises.

The clip also repeated the claim that the company had contracted the services of an unnamed law firm specializing in cases involving
