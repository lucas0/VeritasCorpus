  An old image purportedly showing a group of recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals act burning an American flag took another lap around the internet in December 2017, after it was featured in a

   DACA RECIPIENTS DRAPED IN MEXICAN FLAGS BURN THE AMERICAN FLAG YET WANT AMNESTY???

  The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals act, or DACA, refers to people who entered the United States as minors without documentation and grew up culturally American; DACA allows them to obtain driver’s licenses, work permits, and sometimes in-state

  after President Donald Trump announced he was ending the program, putting at least 800,000 people at risk for deportation.

  The “DACA” image has been circulating with similar claims since at least September 2017, but is from a protest more than a year before that. Repeat offender

   The image does show a group of protesters draped in Mexican flags. However, the object being burned is not an American flag, and there’s no evidence that the pictured protesters are DACA recipients; DACA recipients originate from all over the

  outside the California Republican Convention at the Hyatt Regency in Burlingame, California on 29 April 2016 by photographer Gabriella Angotti-Jones. The accompanying caption made no mention of the DACA program, the legal status of those pictured, and the burning object in the foreground was identified as a Trump piñata, not a flag.

  The claim that these protesters were participants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program appears to have been completely invented by people trying to push a particular ideology. We

  <a href="http://time.com/3923128/donald-trump-announcement-speech/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   comments
  </a>
  Trump had made about the Mexican community:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Protesters linked arms on one side of the street blocking incoming traffic on Old Bayshore Highway, while a raucous crowd of several hundred people — some whose faces were covered with bandanas — waved Mexican flags on the other side of the street, chanting, “Shut down Trump.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Trump’s numerous controversial comments throughout his presidential campaign, including those specifically targeting Mexicans, have enraged the Latino community, and have even led to violence breaking out at his rallies.
  </p>
  <p>
   “His policies just aren’t right,” said Roberto Lopez, 21, who was dressed as a Mexican superhero with a mask.  “Just the way he talks about people, about Latinos and immigrants. He’s causing a lot of hate between the country. We’re at a time where we need to unite and he’s dividing us. It’s only going to get worse if he’s elected president.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  In fact, it doesn’t appear that the “DACA” claim was attached to this photograph until September 2017, more than a year after this protest occurred. That was around the same time that President Trump
  <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/05/memorandum-rescission-daca" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   announced
  </a>
  that he would end the program, making it appear that the image’s miscaptioning was not just a misunderstanding, but instead overt propaganda.
