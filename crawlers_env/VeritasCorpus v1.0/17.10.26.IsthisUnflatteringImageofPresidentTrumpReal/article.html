  , a viral video creator with a penchant for poking fun at Trump, along with the following tongue-in-cheek claim:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A friend of a friend of mine works in the White House and said Trump is extremely unhappy with this photo of himself. Do NOT share this photo! I’m serious. It’s not nice. Don’t do it!
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The original post racked up tens of thousands of shares within a few weeks. When the image was re-circulated in October 2017 with a similar claim about Trump’s dislike for the photograph, it gathered more than 400,000 shares.

  This image, however, is fake. Berger created it using a photograph that

  photographer Matthew Cavanaugh took on 27 April 2011 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Berger flipped the original photograph, enlarged Trump’s throat, and colored his skin a darker shade of peach. Here’s a comparison between the genuine image (left) and the doctored image (right). We flipped the doctored image back to its original position for an easier comparison:
