  Regarding your “Cattleguard” story: That joke has been around since the ’60’s at least!  In 1995 it was old hat. (I’m in
  <nobr>
   New Mexico
  </nobr>
  – land of the cattle guard)

  The Cattle Guard story is a really old one. My father was in the legislature in the 1950’s and he got a letter in the mail saying that the then president was going to fire all the cattle guards. I was a teenager and thought it was really stupid. We are ranchers and know what a cattle guard is!

  Re: the “cattle guards” . . . this is an old, old joke that I heard growing up on a dairy farm in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the
  <br>
   50s.
