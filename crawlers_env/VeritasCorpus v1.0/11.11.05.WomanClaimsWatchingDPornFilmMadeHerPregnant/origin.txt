  A week ago we published an article about a woman who claimed to get pregnant after watching a 3D porn movie. The article was fake and we used a photo that we found on the internet. Unfortunately, the article spread around the world because some sites thought that it was real. That was not our intention.

  is a small site from Brazil. We never thought that this could happen. That’s why we are asking this family to accept our sincere apology. That woman and her baby in the photo had nothing to do with this article. They are just a normal family trying to live they’re [sic] own lives. We apologize for taking their photo and wrongfully putting it in our article. Please, do not publish this article again and next time check what you read before you write. This site is a humor site. Nothing here is real.
