 <p>
  Billy Graham’s Prayer For Our Nation
 </p>
 <p>
  THIS MAN SURE HAS A GOOD VIEW OF WHAT’S HAPPENING TO OUR COUNTRY!
 </p>
 <p>
  “Heavenly Father, we come before you today to ask Your forgiveness and to seek Your direction and guidance.  We know Your Word says ‘Woe to those who call evil good,’ but that is exactly what we have done. We have lost our  spiritual equilibrium and reversed our values.  We confess that.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have ridiculed the absolute truth of Your Word and called it Pluralism.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have worshipped other gods and called it multiculturalism.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have endorsed perversion and called it alternative lifestyle.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have exploited the poor and called it the lottery.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have rewarded laziness and called it welfare.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have killed our unborn and called it choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have shot abortionists and called it justifiable.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have neglected to discipline our children and called it building self-esteem.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have abused power and called it politics.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have coveted our neighbor’s possessions and called it ambition.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have polluted the air with profanity and pornography and called it freedom of expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have ridiculed the time-honored values of our forefathers and called it enlightenment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Search us, Oh, God, and know our hearts today; cleanse us from every sin and set us free.  Guide and bless these men and women who have been sent to direct us to the center of Your will, to open ask it in the name of Your Son,  the living Savior, Jesus Christ.  Amen”
 </p>
 <p>
  Commentator Paul Harvey aired this prayer on “The Rest of the Story” on the radio and received a larger response to this program than any other he has ever aired.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Lord’s help, may this prayer sweep over our nation and wholeheartedly become our desire so that we again can be called one nation under God.
