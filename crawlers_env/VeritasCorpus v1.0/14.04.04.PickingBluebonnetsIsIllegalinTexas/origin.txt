  teacher, is he quoting?

  A: I have discovered that there is no provincial legislation that prohibits the picking of trilliums in our province (“Trilliums a protected flower,”
  <nobr>
   May 28).

  In our youth, we were warned such laws existed and no blue-blooded Ontarian dared harvest the sacred blossom.  Did our teachers and parents deceive us? Was it our government that spread this specious story? How many more debunkings of childhood myths can we middle-agers endure?
