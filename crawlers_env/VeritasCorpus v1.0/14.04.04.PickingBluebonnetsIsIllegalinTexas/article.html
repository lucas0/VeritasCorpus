  Back when I was in Boy Scouts, most of our troop’s camping activities took place in desert wilderness areas (wooded areas and natural lakes being rather scarce in our part of southern California).  Typically, as we trekked to our campsites, hikers would dash off the trail to pick up dried stalks of

  </a>
  plants from the desert floor to use as walking sticks.  The first time a tenderfoot tried to grab an upright stalk, however, half a dozen older scouts would immediately shout at him that what he was doing was against the law; only stalks lying on the ground could be legally be taken away, they claimed.

 <p>
  We had plenty of hazing rituals in the Boy Scouts (usually involving sending first-time campers on some version of a

   ),
  </nobr>
  but this wasn’t one of them; most of our troop truly believed that removing the stalks of yucca plants that were still rooted to the ground was prohibited by law.

  I didn’t realize it at the time, but my Scouting experience was my first exposure to a subset of legends having to do with (mistaken) beliefs about various flora and fauna being protected by law.  Many Canadians grew up exposed to a very similar legend, one which held that in Ontario, picking the provincial flower, the

  , was illegal (ostensibly because it would take the flower “seven years to grow back”).  A reference to this

  prompted the following reader responses:

 <blockquote>

   Q: Gershon Rother, NCC land manager, was quoted as saying that the “trilliums are protected by law in Ontario.” What law, other than his

   teacher, is he quoting?
  </p>
  <p>
   A: I have discovered that there is no provincial legislation that prohibits the picking of trilliums in our province (“Trilliums a protected flower,”
   <nobr>
    May 28).
   </nobr>
   In our youth, we were warned such laws existed and no blue-blooded Ontarian dared harvest the sacred blossom.  Did our teachers and parents deceive us? Was it our government that spread this specious story? How many more debunkings of childhood myths can we middle-agers endure?
