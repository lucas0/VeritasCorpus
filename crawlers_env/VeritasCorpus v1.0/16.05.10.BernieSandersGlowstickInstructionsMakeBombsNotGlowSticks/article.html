  A meme directed at Bernie Sanders supporters, purportedly offering them instructions on how to create homemade glow sticks, started circulating on social media in May 2016:

 <div style="text-align: center;">

   <img alt="bernie sanders" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-33545" data-recalc-dims="1" sizes="(max-width: 830px) 100vw, 830px" src="https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2016/05/bernie-sanders.jpg?resize=830,749" srcset="https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2016/05/bernie-sanders.jpg?w=830 830w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2016/05/bernie-sanders.jpg?resize=300,271 300w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2016/05/bernie-sanders.jpg?resize=768,693 768w" style="border: 1px solid black;"/>

  The instructions given in the above-displayed meme don’t create glow sticks, however, but rather explosions. Mixing chlorine and isopropyl alcohol creates a violent chemical reaction, which (when it is confined to a sealed container) has dramatic, potentially dangerous results. A video posted by the Backyard Scientist in 2013 demonstrates this chemical reaction:

  Another video from 2012 shows the result of containing this reaction inside a plastic bottle:

  The exact origins of the above-displayed meme are unclear, but one of the first mentions we were able to uncover was

   posted

  to the /pol/ section of the web site
  <em>

  </em>
  in March 2016. The meme was
  <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/73247948/#q73249715" target="_blank">
   shared
  </a>
  again in May 2016, along with a message encouraging forum members to spread it on social media in an apparent attempt to prank Bernie Sanders supporters:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Hey guys! Let’s trend this on Twitter and my FaveBook. Even though I like Hillary the mostest I still think this is a fun idea for a truce between the Democrat groups! Who’s with me!?
  </p>
  <p>
   Hehehehe
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  While some forum members found this “joke” funny, others reported the meme to the FBI:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Spreading instructions on public forums and social media sites to get people hurt is terrorism and will get you years in prison.
