 <p>
  Pictures which were painted by elephants have gone on display at an Edinburgh gallery.
 </p>
 <p>
  Art graduate Victoria Khunapramot, 26, has brought the paintings from Thailand to the Dundas Gallery on Dundas Street.
 </p>
 <p>
  They include “self-portraits” by Paya, who is said to be the only elephant to have mastered his own likeness.
 </p>
 <p>
  Paya is one of six elephants whose keepers have taught them how to hold a paintbrush in their trunks. They drop the brush when they want a new colour.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mrs Khunapramot, from Newington, said: “Many people cannot believe that an elephant is capable of producing any kind of artwork, never mind a self-portrait.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But they are very intelligent animals and create the entire paintings with great gusto and concentration within just five or
  <nobr>
   10 minutes — the
  </nobr>
  only thing they cannot do on their own is pick up a paintbrush, so it gets handed to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  “They are trained by artists who fine-tune their skills, and they paint in front of an audience in their conservation village, leaving no one in any doubt that they are authentic elephant creations.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Mrs Khunapramot, who set up the Thai Fine Art company after studying the history of art in
  <nobr>
   St Andrews
  </nobr>
  and business management at Edinburgh’s Napier University, said it took about a month to train the animals to paint.
