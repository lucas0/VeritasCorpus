  On 26 June 2017, the
  <a href="http://archive.is/FTJau" target="_blank">
   Metro-UK
  </a>
  web site published a fake story claiming that police had found a baby alive in the Grenfell Tower apartment building in London, 12 days after a devastating fire that killed at least 79 people.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A baby has miraculously survived twelve days after a horrific blaze at the Grenfell Tower in London left 79 people dead. The baby’s voice was heard when Detectives visited the scene for an ongoing investigation.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The article goes on to quote Detective Superintendent Fiona McCormack as saying “The baby was crying when we rushed in. It was on the 16th floor.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Fiona McCormack is a

   Detective Superintendent
  </a>
  for the Metropolitan Police, but this is a fabricated quote.
 </p>
 <p>
  Metro-UK also claimed that London Mayor Sadiq Khan and the police had confirmed the baby’s rescue on Twitter. Both these claims are also false.
 </p>
 <p>
  One clue as to the source’s unreliability is the “Breaking News” graphic that accompanies the story on the Metro-UK web site. The graphic was lifted from the BBC, as this

  shows.

  The fake story has prompted a backlash in the UK. The

   Metro.co.uk
  </a>
  web site emphasized that it had no connection whatsoever to the story, or the Metro-uk.com web site. However, it inaccurately claimed that Metro-uk.com had been started “in order to spread [the] extremely distressing hoax.”

 <p>
  In fact, Metro-uk.com was

  cited several examples of unsuspecting readers who believed the hoax, which came at a time when many among the British public were hoping for good news in the aftermath of a tragedy that had dominated British current affairs since it took place on 14 June 2017.
