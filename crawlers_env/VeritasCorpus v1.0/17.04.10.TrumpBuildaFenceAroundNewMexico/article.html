  along the U.S.-Mexico border, he never advocated building a fence around the state New Mexico.  The article from
  <em>
   National Report
  </em>
  , a fake news site, was just another jape playing on the old trope of clueless Americans’ confusing or equating the U.S. state of New Mexico with the country of Mexico.
