  posts made-up stories about a variety of topics, such as the

  tale of a man selling his 4-year-old for a new Apple Watch, but they have a penchant for publishing fake news about the FDA. In September 2014, they penned a hoax article about

  A disclaimer at the bottom of the web site’s pages states that

  is “the most notorious urban satirical entertainment website with the most shocking headlines and articles.”
