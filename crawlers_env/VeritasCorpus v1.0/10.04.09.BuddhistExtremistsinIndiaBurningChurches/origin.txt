  Urgent prayer request! Please pray for all the churches in India. Buddhist extremists in India burned down
  <nobr>
   20 churches
  </nobr>
  last night. Tonight they plan to destroy
  <nobr>
   200 churches
  </nobr>
  in the province of Olisabang. They plan to kill
  <nobr>
   200 missionaries
  </nobr>
  within
  <nobr>
   24 hours.
  </nobr>
  Right now all Christians are hiding in small villages. Please pray for them and send this mail to Christians you know worldwide. Please ask God to have mercy on our brothers and sisters in India . Please pray for them and commit this matter to our Almighty and Victorious Lord.
