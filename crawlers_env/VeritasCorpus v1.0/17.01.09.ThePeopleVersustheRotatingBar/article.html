  A video that purportedly shows a large group of people getting knocked over by a giant rotating bar has periodically appeared and circulated on social media.  At first glance, it looks slightly alarming:

  The video has been circulating since 2014, and is frequently shared without context or with false information. In November 2014, for example, this video was published to
  <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=845_1415306369" target="_blank">
   LiveLeak
  </a>
  under the title “WTF! DID I JUST WATCH?!” and was tagged with the terms “Japan,” “kill,” and “fan.”
