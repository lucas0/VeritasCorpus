   “(Bramwell’s) illegal activity and his history have finally caught up with him,” DuPage County State’s Attorney Robert Berlin said in a written statement. “Regardless of what was stolen, Mr. Bramwell repeatedly thumbed his nose at the law. He took what he wanted time and time again and expected to avoid the consequences.”
