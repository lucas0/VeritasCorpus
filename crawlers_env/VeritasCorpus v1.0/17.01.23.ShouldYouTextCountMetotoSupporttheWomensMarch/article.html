  The Women’s March on Washington event that took place on 21 January 2017 far exceeded the expectations of its organizers, drawing approximately 500,000 participants in Washington, D.C., and perhaps two million more in other

  across the U.S. and around the world.

  Not long after the marches concluded, word spread that march organizers were asking attendees to text “COUNT ME” to 89800 in order for their presence at that event to be tallied:

  Adding to the confusing the matter was a tweet published and then deleted by the official Women’s March account, disavowing the “text 89800” message:

  The effort appears to be spearheaded by the It’s Time Network, a group professing to be an “inclusive community of people and organizations working collaboratively to accelerate the full empowerment of women and girls in order to achieve gender equity, evolve democracy and build fair economies that regenerate the Earth.” That organization began

  We have been unable to locate any march organizers officially endorsing the “text COUNT ME to 89800” message campaign. Although some satellite marches retweeted information about the program, details such as who was attempting to collect a headcount and for what purposes remained unclear.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have contacted the official Women’s March via e-mail and social media to inquire about the text campaign but have not yet received a response.
