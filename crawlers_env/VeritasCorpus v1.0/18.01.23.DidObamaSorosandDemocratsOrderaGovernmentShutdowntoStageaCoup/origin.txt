  Barack Obama, George Soros, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer; all of these people have worlds to gain by ordering the Democrat party to stand down and allow the federal government to shut its doors. A startling report from the United States Secret Service is raising eyebrows all over Washington and the world:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “Be advised that actionable intel has been gathered from those friendly to ‘Juicer’ suggesting the possibility of a military coup against POTUS. Service policy dictates that those attatched directly to POTUS remain by his side to the bunker while all others secure the grounds of the White House. Anyone not already inside the building when a coup lockdown occurs is considered the enemy and will be shot on breach of the outer gate.”
  </em>

 <p>
  That’s a pretty serious directive. “Actionable intelligence means they’ve deemed it to be serious. “Juicer” is the Secret Service codename for Kellyanne Conway. Trump ordered himself to be referred to as “POTUS” only after the first two, Cheeto and Big Mac, came across as insulting.
