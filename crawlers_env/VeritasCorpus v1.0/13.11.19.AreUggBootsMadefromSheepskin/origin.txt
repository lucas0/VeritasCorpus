  Defying February’s climatic dictates, students lay in the newly fallen snow on the Frist Campus Center’s North Front Lawn, feigning death, wearing coats covered with fake blood and sporting signs that read, “What if you were killed for your coat?”

  The protest, based on a campaign started by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and organized by the Princeton Animal Welfare Society (PAWS), was designed to raise awareness of animals’ suffering as part of the fashion fur industry. The protest focused on Ugg boots, which are made from sheepskin and are popular among college-age women.

  In addition to Uggs, which are openly noted as derived from animals, fur marked as fake may not actually be, PAWS vice president Alex Barnard explained, adding that clothing imported from China is often unregulated, and recent studies indicate that cat and dog fur may be mislabeled as “faux fur.”

  PAWS hopes to address these issues and change people’s perceptions of fashion through the protest.

  “We want people to realize that fur, whether it is fake or real, is just ugly, and there’s no reason to wear it at all,” PAWS president Jenny Palmer said.

  For Haley Thompson though, wearing Uggs remains a personal decision, much like being a vegetarian. “You do the same thing when you sit down and eat a hamburger,” Thompson noted. “I don’t feel like it’s all that different, and I’m not a vegetarian.”
