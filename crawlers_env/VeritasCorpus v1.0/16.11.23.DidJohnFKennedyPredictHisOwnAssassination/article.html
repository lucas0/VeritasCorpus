  The assassination of John F. Kennedy has spurred some of the most prominent and enduring conspiracy theories in the history of American politics. In addition to claims about a second shooter or a government cover-up, we have also seen

   photographs

  purporting to capture the chaotic day (but which actually show scenes from a 1970s made-for-TV movie), and an

   attempt

  to link politician Ted Cruz’s father to Lee Harvey Oswald.

   biography
  </a>
  of Kennedy that was originally published in 1972 and entitled
  <em>
   Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye
  </em>
  ; the book was written by two of Kennedy’s close friends and advisors, special assistant David Powers and political aide Kenneth O’Donnell.
 </p>
 <p>
  Powers and O’Donnell wrote that Kennedy made the observation to his wife Jackie after the First Lady glimpsed a full-page anti-Kennedy advertisement published in the
  <em>
   Dallas Morning News
  </em>

   Welcome Mr. Kennedy
  </a>
  “) on the morning before his assassination:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   <em>
    I had in my hand a copy of the Dallas News, with its black-bordered anti-Kennedy tirade, but I hesitated to show it to the President because I was reluctant to dampen his cheerful mood. I waited while he made a telephone call to Uvalde, Texas, to talk with Jon Nance Garner; Lyndon Johnson reminded him that today was Garner’s ninety-fifth birthday.
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   Then I handed him the newspaper. He said he had seen it, and he showed the black-bordered advertisement to Jackie. That night on the way back to Washington, she and I talked about what he said to her while she was reading the ad. “We’re heading into nut country today,” he said. “But Jackie, if somebody wants to shoot me from a window with a rifle, nobody can stop it, so why worry about it?”
