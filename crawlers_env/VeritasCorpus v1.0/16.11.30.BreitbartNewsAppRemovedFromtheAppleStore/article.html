  On 30 November 2016, conspiracy theorist web sites
  <em>
  </em>
  <a href="http://archive.is/OsUHp" target="_blank">
   reported
  </a>
  that Apple had purged the
  <em>
   Breitbart
  </em>
  app from iTunes:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Apple has removed the Breitbart News app from their iTunes marketplace as the fascistic censorship of free speech and truth journalism kicks into high gear.
  </p>
  <p>
   While the GooglePlay store still carries Breitbart’s Android-compatible app, there is now no official Breitbart app avail for Apple products, despite it having been available for the last three years.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  While it is
  <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/apple-app-store-bans-breitbart-news-app/" target="_blank">
   true
  </a>
  that the
  <em>
   Breitbart
  </em>
  app briefly disappeared from the Apple store, it did not function as proof that Apple was engaging in censorship of free speech, to say nothing of “truth journalism.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The point was moot, however, because the Breitbart app was once again
  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/breitbart/id722987199?mt=8" target="_blank">
   available
  </a>
  on iTunes as of 30 November 2016:

  While the app did briefly vanish, there is no evidence that it was removed as part of a larger censorship scheme.  We have reached out to Apple for clarification on the issue.
