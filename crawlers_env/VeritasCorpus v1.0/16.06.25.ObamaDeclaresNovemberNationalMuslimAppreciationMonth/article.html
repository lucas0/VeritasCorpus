  On 27 September 2013,  the
  <em>
   National Report
  </em>
  published an article reporing that President Obama had proclaimed November 2013 to be National Muslim Appreciation Month,  a time to “celebrate the Muslim community” in the United States:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   President Barack Obama held a press conference to announce that he is declaring the month of November ‘National Muslim Appreciation Month’.
  </p>
  <p>
   “The Muslim community deserves our full acceptance and respect,” Obama told reporters. “We have killed millions of Muslims overseas since the
   <nobr>
    September 11th
   </nobr>
   attacks. They are not all bad. In fact most of them are good. So from now on, November will be a month to celebrate the Muslim community, the Sunnah and the Quran.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  By the following day links and excerpts referencing this article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered the item mistaking it for a genuine news article.  However, the article was just another piece of fabricated clickbait from the
  <em>
   National Report
  </em>
  ,  a fake news web site that publishes outrageous fictional stories such as “IRS Plans to Target Leprechauns Next,” “Boy Scouts Announce Boobs Merit Badge,” and “New CDC Study Indicates Pets of Gay Couples Worse at Sports, Better at Fashion Than Pets of Straight Couples.”
