  <p>
   The Islamic State claimed responsibility for a series of deadly terrorist attacks that struck Brussels, killing at least 30 people at the city’s main international airport and in a subway station at the heart of the city, near the headquarters of the European Union.
  </p>
  <p>
   The deadly violence began shortly before 8 a.m. with an explosion in the departure terminal at Brussels Airport, followed shortly by another. Then, at 9:11 a.m., a bomb tore through the last car of a subway train as it was pulling out of the Maelbeek station.
