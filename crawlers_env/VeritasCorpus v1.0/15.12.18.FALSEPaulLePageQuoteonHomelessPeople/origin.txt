  The worst possible thing to do for a homeless poor person is to offer them a free meal and warm bed; that will only encourage them to feel sorry for themselves and cry over their sad destiny. It would be more merciful to simply take a gun and put them out of their misery. If you’re really keen on helping poor people, which is something I am very sympathetic with, you’d be better off calling them names and insulting them…. as a way of motivating and forcing them to snap out of their feelings of worthlessness.
