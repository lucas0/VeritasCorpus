  On or around 17 December 2015, a “GOP Fail Ultimate Edition” meme featuring the Governor of Maine, Paul LePage, and a quote purportedly uttered by him started circulating around Facebook:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The worst possible thing to do for a homeless poor person is to offer them a free meal and warm bed; that will only encourage them to feel sorry for themselves and cry over their sad destiny. It would be more merciful to simply take a gun and put them out of their misery. If you’re really keen on helping poor people, which is something I am very sympathetic with, you’d be better off calling them names and insulting them…. as a way of motivating and forcing them to snap out of their feelings of worthlessness.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The above-displayed quote was not published by a credible news publication, it was not uttered by LePage during an interview, nor was it featured in a press release from the Governor’s office. The quote originated on 15 December 2015, when it was published in an article on
  <em>
   Newslo,
  </em>
  a web site that uses a combination of fiction and factual information to create an odd brand of fake news:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Newslo is the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web. Readers come to us for a unique brand of entertainment and information that is enhanced by features like our fact-button, which allows readers to find what is fact and what is satire.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  In this case, the “Show Facts” button revealed that LePage was recently

   criticized

  for the mismanagement of Maine’s food stamp program. The quotes attributed to LePage in the
  <em>

  </em>
  story, however, are purely fictional.
