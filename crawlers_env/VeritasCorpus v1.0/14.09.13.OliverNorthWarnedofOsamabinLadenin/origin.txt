  Abu Nidal is, as I am sure you on the Intelligence Committee know, the principal, foremost assassin in the world today. He is a brutal murderer. And I would like to just, if I may, just read to you a little bit about Mr. Abu Nidal …
 </p>
 <p>
  “Abu Nidal, the radical Palestinian guerrilla leader, linked to last Friday’s attacks in Rome and Vienna” — that was the so-called Christmas massacre in which 19 people died and 200 were wounded — “is the world’s most wanted terrorist.” That is the
  <em>
   Christian Science Monitor.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  When you look at his whole career, Abu Nidal makes the infamous terrorist Carlos [the Jackal] look like a Boy Scout.
 </p>
 <p>
  Abu Nidal himself, quoted in
  <em>
   Der Spiegel
  </em>
  , “Between America and us, there exists a war to the death. In the coming months and years, Americans will be thinking about us.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “For sheer viciousness, Abu Nidal has few rivals in the underworld of terrorism.”

  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Our own State Department, and we have copies of these that we can make available for insertion in the record, but the State Department summary on Abu Nidal, not exactly an overstatement, notes that his followers, who number an estimated 500, have killed as many as 181 persons, and wounded more than 200, in two years.
 </p>
 <p>
  Abu Nidal does not deny these things. We also have an exhibit that we can provide for you that shows what Abu Nidal did in the Christmas Massacres. One of the people killed in the Christmas Massacre — and I do not wish to overdramatize this — but the Abu Nidal terrorists in Rome who blasted the 11-year-old American Natasha Simpson to her knees, deliberately zeroed in and fired an extra burst at her head just in case.
 </p>
 <p>
  I want you to know that I’d be more than willing … to meet Abu Nidal on equal terms anywhere in the world. There’s an even deal for him. OK? But I am not willing to have my wife and my four children meet Abu Nidal or his organization on his terms.
