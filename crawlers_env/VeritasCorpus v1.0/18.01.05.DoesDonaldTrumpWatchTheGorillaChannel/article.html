  is full of salacious stories from President Donald Trump’s first year in office.

  PixelatedBoat’s “Gorilla Channel” joke is reminiscent of the fake transcripts between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair that were created by comedian Michael Spicer. In case you were curious, Bill Clinton never said that he
