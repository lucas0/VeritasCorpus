  Boyd Roberts, a Democrat in California, has officially registered with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to run against Rohrabacher, and he has an interesting plan to do so.

  Roberts has submitted the required paperwork to the FEC to establish an “Impeach Trump” leadership political action committee (PAC). The PAC is meant to raise money, which will be donated to help candidates and lawmakers. Based on the paperwork, however, his own campaign is the only beneficiary of it at this time.
