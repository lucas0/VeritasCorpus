  On 8 December 2016, the hashtag #DumpStarWars was widely circulated on social media. While this hashtag trended for a number of reasons, at least one false claim — that an anti-Trump scene was added to the film “Star Wars: Rogue One” — was associated with the boycott.
 </p>
 <p>
  This claim can be traced back to Jack

  , the self-described special projects director of “Citizens for Trump,” who generated the (completely false) rumor that the new
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  film was altered to add an anti-Trump scene:

   Posobiec either pulled this rumor out of thin air, or misinterpreted two unconnected events: scheduled reshoots on the film and “controversial” tweets from two of the film’s writers.

 <p>
  “Star Wars: Rogue One
  <i>
   ”
  </i>
  did undergo some reshoots not long before its official release. This is common for a major studio film, and had nothing to do with politics. Director Gareth Edwards
  <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-rogue-one-gareth-edwards-20161201-story.html" target="_blank">
   explained
  </a>
  the reason in an interview with the
  <em>
   Los Angeles Times:
  </em>
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   We’d always planned to do a pickup shoot but we needed a lot of time to figure out all this material and get the best out of it. So that pushed the entire schedule in a big way. Then Disney saw the film and reacted really well and they said, “Whatever you need, we’re going to support you.” Our visual-effects shot count went from 600 to nearly 1,700, so suddenly we could do absolutely anything we wanted. To design 1,000 visual effects shots should take a year, so it was all hands to the pump and we never came up for air really until about a week ago.
  </p>
  <p>
   It would be beautiful if you write a story, you shoot exactly that, you edit it and it’s a hit. But art — or
   <em>
    good
   </em>
   art — doesn’t work like that. It’s a process, and you experiment and react and improve. And if I make more films, which I hope to, I want to make them like that as well, where it’s organic and it’s not predetermined.
  </p>

  Screenwriters for the film have also made some political comments on their Twitter feeds:

  While the screenwriters’ statements on social media were offered as reasons for a Star Wars

  boycott, claims that the writers added a specific “anti-Trump” message to the film during reshoots were completely unfounded. A representative for Disney told

  out to Posobiec, he admitted that he hadn’t even seen the film:

   I haven’t seen the movie yet, but if the writers are so virulently anti-Trump, I would be surprised to not find that bias embedded in the film.
