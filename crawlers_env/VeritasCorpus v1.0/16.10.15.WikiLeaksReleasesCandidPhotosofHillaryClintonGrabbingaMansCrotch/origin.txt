   After a tumultuous week in the Presidential election Julian Assange has released another bombshell. Wikileaks has released a group of photos allegedly hacked from John Podesta’s emails showing presidential candidate Hillary Clinton grabbing a man’s crotch.

  “You can clearly see,” Assange told a French news outlet,”Hillary has grabbed on the man’s balls. All Donald Trump has done is talk about grabbing women and they call him a rapist. They tried the same thing with me. Look, tripping on the rug and your fingers accidentally winding up in a woman’s coocoo is not rape. What Clinton did is.”
