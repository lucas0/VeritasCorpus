  Hi, this is Russell calling from the Trump for Office Foundation. How are you doing today?
 </p>
 <p>
  Great. Well, we’re calling in regard to a problem we had with recent activity on your social media accounts. Do you have a second to talk about this matter?
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ve been monitoring some of your posts and it does seem that you’ve been making some rather negative comments about President Trump. Is that correct?
 </p>
 <p>
  Listen. We’re going to have to ask you to lay off on the negative and derogatory posts about President Trump, OK? What’s your problem, anyways? Don’t you want to make America great again? Well, you’ve been warned. We’ll be keeping an eye on you. Have a nice day.
 </p>
