  A photograph purportedly depicting a “whisky vending machine” from the 1960s is frequently shared on online along with the claim that this type of device was commonly found in workplaces of the era:

  Two common misconceptions about commonly spread in conjunction with this image. First, while this machine pictured did dispense a “full measure” of whisky, it was designed to mix the liquor with soda or water rather than deliver it straight. Second, this photograph was not taken in a business workplace.

  , this photograph originated at a 1960 trade show for vending machine manufacturers:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Monica Bays pours herself a whisky and soda from an automatic vending slot machine at a trade fair. The machine, produced by Rollason Aerocessaries of Croydon, mixes whisky, water and soda when you insert 2 shillings and sixpence. Time switches ensure it locks automatically to conform with licensing hours.

  The Second Automatic Vending Exhibit and Convention was held in February 1960. A

  from the event notes that there were two other liquor vending machines on display at the convention, one that dispenses a gin and tonic and the other a rum toddy. While these automated liquor vending devices may have captured the online world’s attention in the 21st century, the most popular drink dispenser shown at the Automatic Vending Exhibit back in 1960 was actually a tea machine.

  The exhibit also featured vending machines for pens, towels, milk, bakery items, soups, combs, razors, chocolate, cold buffet items, and cigarettes. Some of these machines are still in use in 2016, while others, such as the whisky dispenser, are rarely seen outside the collections of vintage vending machine aficionados. But although the single drink whisky machine may be a rarity nowadays, machines that vend bottles of alcohol (as seen in the image at the head of this page) are not so uncommon.
