  The music business, even for the most ardently anti-capitalist bands, is a tension between pure art and the crassest of commercial exploitation.  Often, even groups that don’t get derided for “selling out” will quietly write, perform, and sell the rights to a jingle or three to help buy the groceries or keep the lights on.  (One only needs to think of Jack White’s Coca-Cola

  Iron Butterfly even did an extremely surreal commercial for Ban underarm deodorant at one point:

  The Rolling Stones weren’t above doing commercials, either.  A video that was popularized in August 2016 has actually been lurking in the corners of the web for several years, featuring the band’s unmistakable sound in a 1960s-era commercial for Rice Krispies cereal:

   We can confirm that the ad was done by our advertising agency J.W. Thompson for Kellogg’s Great Britain in 1964 and it is titled Juke Box.
