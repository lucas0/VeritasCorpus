  When the Comet Pizza child prostitution ring was exposed, the Democrats and globalists behind it turned it into a public shaming of conservatives. They fed misinformation that sent a concerned patriot overboard to our groups and pages through fake news. Before long, anyone who believed in a child prostitution ring was “crazy like Alex Jones.”

  The origins of that ring have now been exposed more than 250 miles away in Crossfield, New Jersey, where three State Senators and the Democrat Party Chair for The Northeast have been taken into custody by a New Jersey “black ops” recovery team.
