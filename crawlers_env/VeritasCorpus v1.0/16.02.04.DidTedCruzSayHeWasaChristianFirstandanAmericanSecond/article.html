  In February 2016, a rumor started circulating online that Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz had said that he was a “Christian first” and an “American second.” While these words were a genuine quote from the Texas Senator, they were typically presented in a manner that lacked context.

  questioning Cruz’s loyalty to the GOP, and he responded by saying that his allegiance to the United States and to conservative principles trumped his party membership (and that his commitment to his religion ranked higher than them all):

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “It is exactly right that in terms of who I am, I am a Christian first. I am an American second. I’m a conservative third. And I’m a Republican fourth. And I’ll tell ya, there are a lot of Americans who feel the same way.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  We’ve found no video that captured this remark from Cruz, but the quote was also documented by the

  Cruz has made no secret of his plans to court conservative Christians during his presidential campaign.  He
