  One day after the Pulse Orlando nightclub shooting in June 2016, the web site
  <em>
   Daily Caller
  </em>
  published an article reporting that a sitting member of the Homeland Security Advisory Council is a Syrian immigrant who said that 9/11 “changed the world for good” and has “consistently disparaged America” on social media:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Laila Alawa was one of just 15 people tapped to serve on the newly-formed HSAC Subcommittee on Countering Violent Extremism in 2015 — the same year she became an American citizen. Just last week, the subcommittee submitted a report to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, recommending that the DHS avoid using Muslim terminology like the words “sharia” and “jihad” when discussing terrorism.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  By 15 June 2016, various
  <a href="http://archive.is/VCVne/image" target="_blank">
   versions
  </a>
  of this story reported that President Barack Obama personally appointed Alawa “recently” to “the Homeland Security Advisory Council’s Subcommittee on Countering Violent Extremism”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   President Obama once again has shown his cards as an out of touch progressive with an agenda. He recently appointed a 25 year old Syrian immigrant to the Homeland Security Advisory Council’s Subcommittee on Countering Violent Extremism. This is the same person who rejoiced and praised the September 11th attacks and racially baited and attacked white people on social media.
  </p>
  <p>
   The new appointee is Laila Alawa. She is placed on a committee that serves to stop another terrorist attack like September 11th. Despite the fact she praised it as a good thing. Seems rather ironic.
  </p>
  <p>
   In September of 2014 she said,
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    “9/11 changed the world for good and there’s not other way to say it. I just hope we keep having open conversations about our differences.”
   </em>
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  All versions of claims about Laila Alawa appeared in conjunction with widespread reporting on the mass shooting in Orlando, with some unreliable web sites claiming that President Obama personally appointed Alawa to a DHS role:
