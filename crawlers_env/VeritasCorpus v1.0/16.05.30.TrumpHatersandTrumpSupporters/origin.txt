  Hundreds of people showed up today at the funeral of a Nashville Marine, but not to attend the service. Instead, they came to form a counter-protest to a group that has picketed thousands of military funerals across the country.

 <p>
  Twenty-seven-year-old Sergeant Kevin Balduf was killed in a fire fight in Afghanistan last month. The Westboro Baptist Church, a Kansas fundamentalist group, came out to protest the funeral. Friends of the marine started an internet campaign to form a protective shield outside the funeral.
