  On 5 March 2016, the web site
  <em>
   ETHyper
  </em>
  published an article claiming controversial pharmaceutical figure
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2015/09/21/daraprim/" target="_blank">
   Martin Shkreli
  </a>
  was shot and killed:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   After being shot in a drive-by shooting, we have learned that the worlds most hated man, real name Martin Shkreli, has died outside his home Friday afternoon.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rising to infamy last year, Martin Shkreli has been getting much attention after raising the price of AIDS medicine by 5000%. Dubbed the “Biggest Douchebag in the World” and the “Shit-head of the year 2015”, millions of people on social media sites like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook have tuned in to rejoice in the news about Martin Shkreli. Sadly, Martin Shkreli’s reign did not last, as he was shot in front of his home as he was getting into his car.

  <em>

  wasn’t the first web site to make such a claim. The fake news site
  <em>
   LinkBeef
  </em>
  published an identical (down to the photos) article in mid-February 2016. Neither story was true, but neither site featured a disclaimer warning readers that its content was “satirical” in nature.

  about an unrelated tragedy. However, Shkreli was alive and tweeting after the publication of both items:
