  At least two people died and several remained missing after a natural gas explosion and fire leveled an apartment building late Wednesday in the Washington suburb of Silver Spring, Md., fire officials said.

  Assistant Chief Russ Hamill of the Montgomery County Police told reporters Thursday that two bodies were found in the ruins and that the scene would be handled as a “death investigation.” The identity of one of the bodies has led some to speculate, especially following the revelations about murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich this week.

  Immediately after the explosion, journalists and observers began to ask questions … One source CTN spoke with said that 5 to 7 people are still considered to be missing, and it is believed that a long-time DNC staffer may be among the group.

  “No bodies have been identified at this time,” the police chief told surrounding media. “It is very likely that DC staffers, including political types, live in this building.”

  Eyes have turned to mysterious deaths surrounding DNC employees lately, with Julian Assange of Wikileaks offering a cash reward for Seth Rich, who was murdered in a northwest DC neighborhood early last month. Assange even went as far to say that Rich may have been Wikileaks’ source within the Democratic Party.
