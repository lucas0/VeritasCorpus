  Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the Congressional Oversight Committee, may soon resign. He told Politico that his resignation was not in any way related to scandal. “Not in any way shape or form. I’ve been given more enemas by more people over the last eight years than you can possibly imagine. From the Secret Service to the Democratic Party. I am who I am. If they had something really scandalous, it would’ve come out a long, long time ago.”

  Well, it would be true that “it would have come out a long, long time ago” had the FBI been investigating Russian money laundering by people involved in the American political process. But until Donald Trump came along, there weren’t really any major questions about such things in our political process. But we will get into that in a bit.

  Another revelation is that Jason Chaffetz “wants to spend more time with his family” because he is allegedly having an affair.
