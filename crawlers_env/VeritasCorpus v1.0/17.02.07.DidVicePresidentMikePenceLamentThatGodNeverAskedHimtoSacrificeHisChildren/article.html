  reporting that characteristically devout Vice President Mike Pence lamented the fact God had never called upon him to sacrifice one of his own children:

 <blockquote>

   Saying he would surely rise to the occasion if tasked by the Almighty with the ultimate test of faith, Vice President Mike Pence said that he was disappointed that God has never called upon him to kill one of his own children. “It’s just heartbreaking that the Lord hasn’t summoned me once to show my dedication to Him by sacrificing one of my precious kids,” said Pence, telling reporters that he has spent years waiting for any sign at all from the Heavenly Father that he should ritually slaughter one of his three children. “They’re grown now, so I’m starting to think I’ll never get the chance to offer the blood of any of them to prove my unshakable devotion. Heck, I’d put all three on an altar if that’s what He wanted.” Pence added that he would nevertheless keep a sharp dagger at the ready in the unlikely event God someday asks him to kill one of his grandchildren.

  Although most social media users recognize
  <em>
   The Onion
  </em>
  as a purveyor of satirical humor, we received multiple e-mails and social media posts asking whether this concise bit of satire was a real news story. The advent of fake news sites has resulted in a tsunami of social media links to fabricated stories, unfunny and frequently difficult to identify falsehoods spread by fake news purveyors for their own financial benefit. But
  <em>
   The Onion
  </em>
  has a long history as a
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/info/news/adamsandlerpredictions.asp" target="_blank">
   satirical
  </a>
  publication and has never aimed to dupe, rather than entertain, their readers.

Despite its long, pre-internet history, <em>The Onion</em>&nbsp;is somewhat commonly&nbsp;<a href="http://www.snopes.com/Politics/satire/blackfriday.asp" target="_blank">confused</a> for a real news outlet by some social media users.&nbsp;Before "fake news" and ubiquitous fabrications became a topic of heated national debate, users mistaking <em>The Onion</em> for actual&nbsp;news&nbsp;inspired a popular <a href="http://literallyunbelievable.org/" target="_blank">blog</a>&nbsp;depicting instances of such errors (then funny for their rarity).

<em>The Onion</em>'s piece on Pence's purported lament was one of several instances where a number of readers confused&nbsp;the site for real news. Similar claims included one asserting&nbsp;that SeaWorld housed&nbsp;orcas in gargantuan&nbsp;<a href="http://www.snopes.com/orcas-plastic-bags/" target="_blank">plastic bags</a>&nbsp;while cleaning their tanks,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.snopes.com/elephant-drowning-at-sea-world/" target="_blank">that</a>&nbsp;SeaWorld introduced an attraction of "Just [an] Elephant Drowning in [a] Large Tank of Water with No Explanation," that a teen's parents chose&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.snopes.com/caitlin-teagart/" target="_blank">euthanize</a> her because she was only "capable of texting and rolling her eyes," that <a href="http://www.snopes.com/mike-pence-disappointed-womens-march/" target="_blank">Pence</a> expressed disappointment (again) at husbands and fathers allowing their wives and daughters to march on Washington in January 2017, that Chicago city workers cleaned 18 inches of shell <a href="http://www.snopes.com/18-inches-of-bullet-casings-cover-chicago-streets/" target="_blank">casings</a> from every street, and that hundreds of <a href="http://www.snopes.com/cuban-refugees-clinging-to-air-force-one/" target="_blank">Cubans</a> clung to the wings of Air Force One following a visit to the country by President Obama in 2016.
