  On 26 August 2016, San Francisco 49ers quarterback

   Colin Kaepernick
  </a>
  declined to stand for the national anthem during a NFL game, causing a flare-up of controversy. On 30 August 2016, what appeared to be a local news affiliate
  <a href="http://archive.is/0UG0j/image" target="_blank">
   reported
  </a>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   After several days of media attention and public humiliation following his decision to sit during the national anthem of a pre-season game, San Francisco 49’ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has reportedly been found dead in his upscale Alameda County home.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rumors of the quarterback’s death began circulating early Tuesday morning, and a coroner’s van was seen outside the Kaepernick estate, according to sources on the ground.
  </p>
  <p>
   While foul play is not suspected, it is reported that two guns and a large amount of narcotics were retrieved from the scene.

 <p>
  Needless to say, Kaepernick’s “death” went unreported by any credible outlets. The article used a photograph of an Alameda County Coroner’s van, which was
