  The things our children are being taught today are far different than what most of us are used to. And while some education has changed for the better, perhaps the most controversial topic schools are approaching is how they are teaching children what is “politically correct.”

  Recently, it came to light that a high school in Michigan was taking things to an extreme. When Lieutenant Colonel Sherwood Baker, a 24-year-old military veteran was taking his daughter to school in uniform, he was stopped by one of the school’s security personnel.

  “Before he was allowed in, the security guard stopped him and said sorry you’re not allowed in the school,” Rachel Ferhadson, the Lieutenant’s wife told a local radio station. “Security told him men and women in uniform weren’t allowed because it may offend another student.”
