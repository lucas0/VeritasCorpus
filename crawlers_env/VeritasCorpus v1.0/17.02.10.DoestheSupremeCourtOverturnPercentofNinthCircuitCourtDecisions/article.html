  Following a 9 February 2017
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2017/02/09/appeals-court-travel-restrictions/" target="_blank">
   Ninth Circuit
  </a>
  Court of Appeals decision upholding an injunction that halted a temporary U.S. entry restriction enacted via an Executive Order on 27 January 2017, social media users began sharing posts holding that approximately 80 percent of the decisions handed down by that court were eventually overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS).
 </p>
 <p>
  Many of those users cited a 9 February 2017 blog post which
  <a href="http://archive.is/7jRw9" target="_blank">
   asserted
  </a>
  that:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Eight of out of 10 cases from the 9th Circuit reviewed by the Supreme Court are overruled, according to a 2010 analysis published by the American Bar Association. The 9th Circuit, which is known for its liberal tendencies, has the second-highest reversal rate of the 13 appellate courts below the Supreme Court.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The blog linked to a 2010 American Bar Association
  <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/intelprop/magazine/LandslideJan2010_Hofer.authcheckdam.pdf" target="_blank">
   paper
  </a>
  which opened by pointing out two common erroneous beliefs about Supreme Court reversals in general:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   When the subject of Supreme Court reversal rates arises, two common perceptions usually come to mind. First, the Ninth Circuit is the “rogue circuit.” Second, the Supreme Court only takes cases that it intends to reverse. An empirical study of Supreme Court dispositions of cases from the courts of appeals during the last 10 Terms reveals that neither of these common perceptions is true.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each year the federal courts of appeals collectively terminate an average of 60,467 cases. However, the Supreme Court only reviews an average of 64 cases per year, which is about 0.106% of all decisions by the federal courts of appeals.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  So, although correctly worded, the blog post left many readers with the mistaken impression that 80 percent of the Ninth Circuit Court’s decisions were being overturned by SCOTUS.  What it actually said was that of the
  <em>
   very tiny fraction of decisions by federal courts of appeal that SCOTUS agrees to review each year
  </em>
  (0.1%), 80 percent of that small portion of appeals originating with the Ninth Circuit Court were overturned.
 </p>
 <p>
  With respect to how the Ninth Court came to be described as a “rogue court,” the paper referenced above maintained:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   So how did the Ninth Circuit get the reputation for being the “rogue circuit”? Well, “figures don’t lie, but liars figure.” One measure of a circuit’s success “is the extent to which its decisions have been reviewed and reversed or vacated by the Supreme Court.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Reversal rates for each court of appeals would be very small, in the range of a tenth of a percent, if calculated as the total number of cases reversed over the total number of appeals terminated by that court. Conversely, if the reversal rate is calculated as the total number of cases reversed over the total number of cases reviewed by the Supreme Court, the ratio increases dramatically. So, in the big picture, i.e., considering all of the appeals terminated by each circuit, reversal rates for all courts of appeals could be very low, if calculated by the former method, or very high, if calculated by the latter method.

  The paper contained three tables tallying specific circuit court figures for the period between 1998 and 2008:
