  The Obama family decided to go out for Breakfast Sunday morning only to have their hopes shattered by the Patriots who worked at the restaurant they went to. The owners of the Komonawannafeedya restaurant in Maui encouraged the employees to walk out when the Obamas made their typical Sunday morning stop while vacationing in Hawaii to show their support for incoming President Donald Trump.

  The owners consider themselves patriots and say they used to enjoy the free publicity of the Obama visits when they were in town but could no longer keep up the facade that they were happy with their president.
