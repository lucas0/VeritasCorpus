   A 24-year old woman from Edmonton in Canada’s Alberta Province has been rushed to hospital after a fidget spinner became stuck inside her vagina. Surgeons were forced to operate on the woman to remove the device, which had become stuck after she used it in an attempt to ‘pleasure herself’.

   “We are confident the woman will make a full recovery, but for the moment she does face a fairly long recovery due to the internal damage the device made,” said one of the doctors who operated on the woman.

  injuries. An immediate red flag is the identical verbiage in two separate locations (and countries), along with a lack of corroborating reports published by local media outlets.

 <p>
  Neither of the sites reporting the purported incidents are genuine news outlets. Additionally, the likelihood of the same “accident” occurring in two far-flung places (not to mind the word-for-word resemblance in the articles) is extraordinarily slim.
