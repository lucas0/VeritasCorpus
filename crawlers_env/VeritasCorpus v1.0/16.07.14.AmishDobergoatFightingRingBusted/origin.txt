 <p>
  Southern Regional Police busted an Amish Dobergoat fighting ring this morning just south of Quarryville.
 </p>
 <p>
  The bust which happened at 3am resulted in the arrest of 12 Amish men and the confiscation of more than 30 dobergoats.
  <br>
   “I never seen nothing like it. There was dead and injured Dobergoats everywhere.” said SRPD officer Matt Nevins.

 </p>
 <p>
  Dobergoats are the result of crossbreeding a Boer Goat and a Doberman Pinscher. Originally bred by the Amish to protect cattle and sheep, Dobergoat fighting was popularized by Lancaster Amish in the 1980’s.
