  The Lenox Theatre was begun by black businessmen because blacks were frustrated with their treatment in the white theaters along Broad Street.

 <p>
  J. Philip Waring, founder of the Augusta Black History Committee and a retired Urban League executive, in a 1995 interview recalled the efforts of his father, John P. Waring Sr., one of the Lenox founders.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Why the Lenox?” said Waring, who is now deceased. “Because this was the height of Jim Crowism — the rule of the day, manifested by black people having to go through the back alley and going through the very back, up the fire escape at the Imperial Theatre. They called it the ‘buzzard’s roost.’ There were all sorts of jokes about it.
