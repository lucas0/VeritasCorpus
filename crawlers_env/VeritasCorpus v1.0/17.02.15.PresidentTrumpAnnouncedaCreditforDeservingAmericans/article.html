  reporting that President Trump had announced a “stimulus bonus” of $612 to be disbursed to “deserving” American adults and children:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   If you’re not a lazy bum on welfare or an illegal here to steal food stamps and free medicine, President Trump has some good news for you. You, your wife and your children will all be receiving a stimulus bonus of $612 each to spend however you see fit inside the United States.

  <p>
   The program, called “Tax Relief For Deserving Americans,” will give nothing to those who choose not to work, people in prison or illegal aliens. People on welfare in good standing with work programs or job training will receive an extra $25 in bonus food stamps instead.

    While deciding how to distract the American people from the nonsense being “reported” by the fake news media about world events and interior politics, President Trump was reminded of how much everyone enjoyed the money George W Bush handed out from the surplus left over from the Clinton administration. Mr. trump has decided people would rather focus on spending some money than the nonsense on the “news,” and has therefore authorized the release of $612 each for every legal American from a working family.

  Of course, there is no “White House Communication and Propaganda Office,” nor did President Trump decree “deserving” Americans were set to receive a bonus of any sort.

  in April 2017 with one notable change: President Trump was allegedly giving $888, not $612, to the American people. This, of course, was also fake news.
