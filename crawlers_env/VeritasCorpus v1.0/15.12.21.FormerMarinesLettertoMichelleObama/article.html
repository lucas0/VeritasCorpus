  On 17 December 2015, the web site
  <em>
   Q Political
  </em>
  posted an article titled “When Michelle Obama Challenged a Marine, His Response Was Brutally Honest.”  With the exception of a few added brief sentences, a misleading photograph, and baseless claim that Michelle Obama “challenged” a Marine, the
  <em>
   Q Political
  </em>
  article was simply a verbatim copy of an opinion piece
  <a href="http://dcgazette.com/2015/marines-letter-michelle-obama-marine-tells-like/" target="_blank">
   penned
  </a>
  by Marine Mike Shepard and posted on 30 May 2015 to the
  <em>
   DC Gazette
  </em>
  (a clickbait web site that, among other things, posts
  <a href="http://dcgazette.com/2015/ouch-woman-hides-stolen-can-of-cookie-dough-in-her-vagina-then-boom/" target="_blank">
   fake news
  </a>
  items as if they were real news).  That piece began as follows:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Mrs. Obama
  </p>
  <p>
   It sickens me that I have to take time to write you this letter. I am a Marine who doesn’t recognize color because every color has lived and died for you. You live in a free country to blame your life on the color of another man’s skin. All colors have given their lives for an educated woman to have the freedom to be so ignorant. I don’t blame black people for the ignorance that comes from your mouth. I love all colors because I love all that God creates. I don’t have to like you to love you because we can’t always like the ones we love. Just because I don’t like you today doesn’t mean I can’t like you tomorrow. I don’t like you or your husband today because of what you’re doing to this country. Isn’t it funny how the truth always reveals itself in time. You and your husband never showed this side of yourselves in 2008 before he was elected.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Shepard writes in his
  <em>
   DC Gazette
  </em>
  biography that he served in the U.S. Marines for 9 years:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   After graduating high school I served nine years in the Marines. My loyalty is to God, country, family in that order. I am not your typical writer. I am just a Marine with an opinion. What I write is my opinion and not persuaded by anyone else.
  </p>

  While
  <em>
   Q Political
  </em>
  did not mention Shepard’s race, the photograph included with their article suggested that he was African-American:
