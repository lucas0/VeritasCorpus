  My hope was that perhaps a plane might fly over and see [my SOS sign], but in all my time on the island, I had not seen

   1 single

  plane fly over. I didn’t give up though. Fast forward a couple more years:
 </p>
 <p>
  I woke up 1 morning to the sound of a plane flying over me which was unusually low, I could not believe it, I thought it was a dream. I ran to the beach screaming and waving my arms like a lunatic, the plane flew over 2 or 3 more times and then dropped a small package.

  Inside was a radio, fresh water, food and a small medical kit. I switched on the radio and heard the first human voice for years. We talked for what seemed like an eternity, then I asked the voice on the other end “How did you find me” to which they replied “Some kid from Minnesota found your SOS sign on Google Earth” I didnt even know what Google Earth was, but I’m eternally in their debt now.
