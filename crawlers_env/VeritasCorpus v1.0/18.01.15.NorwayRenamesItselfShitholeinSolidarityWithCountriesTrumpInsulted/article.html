   published
  </a>
  an article claiming that Norway had renamed itself “shithole” in order to send a message to the U.S. President:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   (Oslo, Shithole) After being singled out by President Trump as a preferable source of immigration compared to ‘shithole’ nations like Haiti and many countries in Africa, Norway has taken the drastic step of renaming itself to show it does not approve of such behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
   […]
  </p>
  <p>
   “We Norwegians are a pragmatic people who don’t much care what the country is called. If renaming it Shithole sends a progressive message of goodwill then that’s what being Norwegian is all about.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  This, of course, is not a genuine news article. Norway did not officially change its name to Shithole.

  Although Oslo has not officially responded to Trump’s alleged remarks, many outlets
  <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/01/trump-shithole-norway/550382/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   noted
  </a>
  that Norwegians don’t currently have much incentive to immigrate to the United States:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Norway is the world’s happiest country (the U.S. ranks 14), the place with the most political freedom (the U.S. ranks 45), most press freedom (the U.S. ranks 43rd), and most prosperity (the U.S. ranks 18). Simply put, there’s little economic incentive for Norwegians to immigrate to the U.S.
