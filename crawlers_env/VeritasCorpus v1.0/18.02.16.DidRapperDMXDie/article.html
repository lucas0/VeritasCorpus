  In February 2018, rumors spread online that the 47-year-old rapper DMX had died. The speculation was partly fuelled by a widely-shared prank Facebook post, and partly by confusion over older reports about an alleged drug overdose.
 </p>
 <p>
  As of 16 February 2018, DMX is alive. At the time of publication, the rapper and producer (whose real name is Earl Simmons) is
  <a href="https://www.bop.gov/mobile/find_inmate/#inmate_results" target="_blank">
   incarcerated
  </a>
  at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, after being remanded into custody on 30 January, in connection with felony tax evasion charges.
 </p>
 <p>
  Speaking to us by phone, Simmons‚Äôs attorney Murray Richman confirmed that his client is alive and well, and that he had met and spoken with him more than once during the week of 12 February 2018. Asked whether DMX had fallen ill or been hospitalized recently, Richman said ‚Äúhe certainly has not.‚Äù

  The celebrity gossip web site
  <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2018/01/30/dmx-bail-revoked-back-to-jail/" target="_blank">
   TMZ
  </a>
  reported that Simmons had violated the conditions of his probation by consuming alcohol and narcotics while visiting St. Louis, Missouri, where he had performed on 20 January.
 </p>
 <p>
  Court records show that on 30 January 2018, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff ordered DMX to be remanded into custody, and prison records show that he was incarcerated at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, as of 16 February 2018.
 </p>
 <p>
  Simmons‚Äôs probation conditions mean he must undergo drug rehabilitation treatment, and ask the judge for special permission any time he wants to leave the state of New York. While travelling, he must be accompanied by a drug counsellor.

  a distasteful prank death notice for the rapper, writing:

   A few thousand people think DMX is dead right now smh. I never even mentioned death or him dying in the post.

  The post claims DMX ‚Äúpassed by,‚Äù not passed away.
