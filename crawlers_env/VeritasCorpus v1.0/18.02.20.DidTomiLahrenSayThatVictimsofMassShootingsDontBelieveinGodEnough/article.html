  As lawmakers faced calls to offer more than just “thoughts and prayers” in the wake of a deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida, in February 2018, political commentator Tomi Lahren

   argued
  </a>
  that more prayer was never a bad thing. According to a viral

  , Lahren took this argument a step further and concluded that people who died during mass shootings simply didn’t believe in God strongly enough:

   Final Thoughts

  ” segment following the 14 February 2018 shooting in Parkland, Florida, Lahren said that although “thoughts and prayers” may not be enough to stop school shootings, we still need more prayer:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   My first and final thoughts go out to all the Parkland, Florida, students, teachers, staff and parents going through hell right now. I can’t imagine their pain following the school massacre, and how difficult this must be.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some will say offering thoughts and prayers isn’t enough … and that might be true.

  <p>
   […]
  </p>
  <p>
   But maybe, just maybe, more Jesus, more God, more prayer and more compassion is what we are missing.
