  A man is accused of purchasing dozens of guns and using someone else’s information to buy them. The woman whose information was used says she was shocked when law enforcement officials showed up at her door.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, a federal criminal complaint has been filed against 23-year-old Dontray Mills. He is accused of knowingly using false identification to buy guns.
 </p>
 <p>
  Officials say beginning in late 2012 and through April of 2014, Mills purchased 27 firearms at places like Gander Mountain and Mills Fleet Farm — listing an address that wasn’t his.
 </p>
 <p>
  Investigators are now looking into whether the guns were then resold, and whether any potential buyers were criminals who aren’t allowed to have firearms.
