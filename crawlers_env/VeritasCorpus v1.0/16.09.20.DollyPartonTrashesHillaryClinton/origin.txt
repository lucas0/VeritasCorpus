  Dolly Parton has long been one of America’s most legendary singing and songwriting talents. Until recently, she was fairly liberal, and a big supporter of Hillary Clinton.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a statement not long ago, Parton said she was inspired that a woman might be President for the first time in our nation’s history.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’re doing good,” she commented at the time. “We got a woman that could go in the White House, so we’ve certainly come a long way in that respect.”Recently, Parton saw the light and realized that Hillary would be quite possible the worst person to be the champion for woman throughout the nation. She now understands that Hillary is a liar; she’s as corrupt as they come.
