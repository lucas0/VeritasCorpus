  We contacted the City of Dearborn’s Public Information and Police departments to ask about the photograph. The individuals to whom we spoke confirmed that no such rally had taken place in Dearborn on 5 December 2015, or at any other time.

  Detroit television station WXYZ published an article on the same day as the Facebook post that

   reported

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Hundreds of Arab Americans in metro Detroit are taking a stand against ISIS and terrorism.
  </p>
  <p>
   This weekend, they gathered for a peaceful protest against hate outside of the Karbala Islamic Center in Dearborn.

  Images tweeted by WXYZ included similar weather conditions and the presence of multiple flags (none of which were the sort linked with the Islamic State), demonstrating that this photograph captured an anti-ISIS demonstration in Dearborn, not a pro-ISIS rally:
