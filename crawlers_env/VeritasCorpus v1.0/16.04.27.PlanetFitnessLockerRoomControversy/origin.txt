  Last week, in a Michigan location a woman was shocked when she found a man inside the women’s dressing room. When she complained to the manager, she was told that biological men who dress as women are welcome inside the ladies’ room. When she complained to the corporate office, the company issued this statement in full support of gender confused men[.]
