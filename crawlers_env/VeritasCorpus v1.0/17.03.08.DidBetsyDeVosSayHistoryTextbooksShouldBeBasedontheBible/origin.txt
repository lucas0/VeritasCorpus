  WASHINGTON, D.C. — Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced today that the 2017-2018 school year will feature drastically revised history texts for all school grades. At a luncheon being held at a D.C. area school for corporate backers of charter schools, DeVos announced that all history books will contain only the information that can also be found in the Christian Bible.

  “If it’s not important enough to be mentioned in the Bible,” Secretary DeVos stated, “I don’t see why it’s important enough to be in our texbooks [sic].”
