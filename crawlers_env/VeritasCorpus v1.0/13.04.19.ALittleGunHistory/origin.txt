  A LITTLE GUN HISTORY
 </p>
 <p>
  In 1929, the Soviet Union established gun control. From 1929 to 1953, about 20 million dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915 to 1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, a total of 13 million Jews and others who were unable to defend themselves were rounded up and exterminated.
 </p>
 <p>
  China established gun control in 1935. From 1948 to 1952, 20 million political dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to 1981, 100,000 Mayan Indians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to 1977, one million educated people, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Defenseless people rounded up and exterminated in the 20th Century because of gun control: 56 million.
 </p>
 <p>
  It has now been 12 months since gun owners in Australia were forced by new law to surrender 640,381 personal firearms to be destroyed by their own Government, a program costing Australia taxpayers more than $500 million dollars. The first year results are now in:
 </p>
 <p>
  List of 7 items:
 </p>
 <p>
  Australia-wide, homicides are up 3.2 percent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Australia-wide, assaults are up 8.6 percent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Australia-wide, armed robberies are up 44 percent (yes, 44 percent)!
 </p>
 <p>
  In the state of Victoria alone, homicides with firearms are now up 300 percent. Note that while the law-abiding citizens turned them in, the criminals did not, and criminals still possess their guns!
 </p>
 <p>
  While figures over the previous 25 years showed a steady decrease in armed robbery with firearms, this has changed drastically upward in the past 12 months, since criminals now are guaranteed that their prey is unarmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  There has also been a dramatic increase in break-ins and assaults of the ELDERLY. Australian politicians are at a loss to explain how public safety has decreased, after such monumental effort, and expense was expended in successfully ridding Australian society of guns. The Australian experience and the other historical facts above prove it.
 </p>
 <p>
  You won’t see this data on the US evening news, or hear politicians disseminating this information…. The NY Sullivan Act intended to tip the advantage toward Irish criminals, away from Italian criminals, and far away from the lawful.
 </p>
 <p>
  Guns in the hands of honest citizens save lives and property and, yes, gun-control laws adversely affect only the law-abiding citizens.
 </p>
 <p>
  Take note my fellow Americans, before it’s too late!
 </p>
 <p>
  The next time someone talks in favor of gun control, please remind them of this history lesson.
 </p>
 <p>
  With guns, we are ‘citizens’. Without them, we are ‘subjects’.
 </p>
 <p>
  During WWII the Japanese decided not to invade America because they knew most Americans were ARMED!
 </p>
 <p>
  If you value your freedom, please spread this anti-gun control message to all of your friends.
