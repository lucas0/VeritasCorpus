  In July 2016, a fake news article published by the entertainment
  <em>
   World News Daily Report
  </em>
  started recirculating on the internet:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Zimbabwean authorities have confirmed that 5 men were killed and 3 others were severely injured when attacked by a pride of lions in the Hwange National Park, in the Matabeleland North province.
  </p>
  <p>
   The victims are local poachers who were illegally hunting for elephants inside the boundaries the national park, when they were surprised by a group of almost twenty adult Southwest African lions, the same species as Cecil the Lion, who died a few kilometres from the site in July 215.

  The story posted above was originally published in March 2016, but it didn’t gain much traction until a few months later. While it’s not clear exactly why the article received a boost in popularity, it may be because

   Cecil
  </a>
  the Lion was killed a year before, in July 2015. The article may have also received a bump after an anti-poaching group posted a hoax
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/lion-revenge-trophy-hunter-video/" target="_blank">
   video
  </a>
  that purported to show a lion attacking two poachers.

 <p>
  Regardless of the reason for the article’s popularity, this is a piece of
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2016/01/14/fake-news-sites/" target="_blank">
   fake

  news from a well-known entertainment web site:
