  On 10 August 2016, the unreliable web site
  <em>
   Disclose.tv
  </em>
  published an
  <a href="http://archive.is/yMShJ" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  reporting that former National Security Agency (NSA) employee and whistleblower Edward Snowden was “pronounced dead by his girlfriend” in Russia:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Days after Edward Snowden‘s rumored death was debunked by journalist Glenn Greenwald and a Russian lawyer, a report emerged that his mistress and girlfriend have confirmed the leaker’s demise.
  </p>
  <p>
   HE WAS KILLED SATURDAY BY A DRUNKEN KNIFE WIELDING BURYAT
  </p>
  <p>
   Quoting MKRU News of Russia, a conservative site called Get Off the BS said Monday afternoon that Snowden’s mistress said he was killed Saturday by a drunken knife wielding Buryat man in the Republic of Buryatia.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The
  <a href="http://archive.is/DPWKs" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  from which the claim was aggregated was presented in the style of fiction rather than reporting and was interspersed with salacious fabrications:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Late Monday afternoon, the mistress of the infamous Edward Snowden announced the death of Snowden, who was allegedly killed this past Saturday by a drunken knife wielding Buryat man in the Republic of Buryatia.
  </p>
  <p>
   MKRU News (Russia) reported this past Saturday that a drunken man who for some reason took exception to a man, presumably Snowden, saving his wife from drowning, attacked a woman by slicing her neck and stabbed her male companion in the thigh, who later died from severe blood loss in a local hospital … The injured were taken to a nearby hospital, where one of them died as a result of the extensive blood loss. The unidentified man was allegedly 27 years old. (Snowden who was born on June 21, 1983, would be 33 now)
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  That outlet connected the purported death of Snowden to a cryptic, since-deleted
  <a href="http://mashable.com/2016/08/05/edward-snowden-tweet-code/" target="_blank">
   tweet
  </a>
  issued by the exiled contractor on 5 August 2016:

  While it was true the disappearing tweet was interpreted by many as an ominous signal, an
