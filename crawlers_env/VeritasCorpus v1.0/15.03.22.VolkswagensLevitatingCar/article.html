   Volkswagen is taking an entirely new approach to customer dialogue in China. From today, Chinese internet users can post their ideas about the car of the future on the “People’s Car Project” (PCP) platform at www.zaoche.cn.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Volkswagen has set out to create the most innovative dialogue platform ever with the ‘People’s Car Project’. The platform is debuting in China, because that is Volkswagen’s largest and most important market. However, we also see potential for launching the project in other markets as well,” Luca de Meo, Director of Marketing, Volkswagen Group and the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand, explained. PCP is initially scheduled to run for a one-year period.

   Over 450 million people have access to the internet in China. These users are particularly interested in interactive content. The project reflects this demand. “We hope to involve people via the internet and inspire them for Volkswagen,” de Meo commented. Internet users accessing the PCP page can click their way to

   their Volkswagen model of the future as well as posting ideas which are then discussed and developed further by other users. They can also upload images or films.
  </p>
  <p>
   “With PCP we are listening very carefully to what our customers have to say and are building cars not only for, but also with people,” Luca de Meo explains, adding that this gives Volkswagen a valuable insight into the wishes, needs and demands of Chinese customers.
