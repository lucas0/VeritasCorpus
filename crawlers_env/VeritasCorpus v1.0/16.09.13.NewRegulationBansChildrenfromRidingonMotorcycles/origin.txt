  The U.S. Federal government has announced a new safety regulation that will prevent minors under the age of 18-years old from riding as a passenger on motorcycles. According to government officials, the United States Department of Transportation (D.O.T) and the American Motorcyclist Association were supportive and heavily involved in developing the regulation.

 <p>
  The regulation will be in effect beginning 01/05/17, however according to Harold Mathers, a spokesperson for the United States Department of Transportation, local police departments throughout the country have been granted the authority to operate under an ‘FYI’ period until 04/05/17.

  Many are not surprised by the regulation as children riding as passengers on the back of motorcycles has been a controversial topic for several decades. Prior to the implementation of the new regulation, individual states were permitted to create their own laws regarding motorcycle safety including the minimum age of passengers.
