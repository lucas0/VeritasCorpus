  In 2007, medical researchers at the University of Alberta
  <a href="http://www.dca.med.ualberta.ca/Home/Updates/2007-03-15_Update.cfm" target="_blank">
   reported
  </a>
  that dichloroacetate (DCA), a relatively simple compound, had showed promise for treating cancer in rodent models, and the university’s DCA Research Team announced they would begin clinical trials of DCA on human patients in the spring of 2007.  One of the members of that research team, Dr. Evangelos Michelakis, expressed concern that because DCA was not patented, the potential profit margins in marketing it would likely be small, and thus it might be difficult to obtain funding for DCA clinical trials from private investors:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The DCA compound is not patented and not owned by any pharmaceutical company, and, therefore, would likely be an inexpensive drug to administer, says Michelakis, the Canada Research Chair in Pulmonary Hypertension and Director of the Pulmonary Hypertension Program with Capital Health, one of Canada’s largest health authorities.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, as DCA is not patented, Michelakis is concerned that it may be difficult to find funding from private investors to test DCA in clinical trials. He is grateful for the support he has already received from publicly funded agencies, such as the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR), and he is hopeful such support will continue and allow him to conduct clinical trials of DCA on cancer patients.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, this preliminary information soon led to hyperbolic claims that a “simple cure for cancer” had been found but a lack of interest on the part of pharmaceutical companies was preventing it from reaching cancer patients,

   prompting
  </a>
  some desperate cancer sufferers to seek it out for themselves from unscrupulous vendors:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Note that there were two assumptions about the study [in 2007]. First, these bloggers and pundits assumed that the cell culture and animal work were definitive evidence that DCA might be a “cure” for cancer. Second, the assumption was that, because the drug was out of patent and very cheap to make, neither the government nor pharmaceutical companies would be interested in funding it, thus condemning thousands, maybe millions, of people to die of cancer unnecessarily. Unfortunately, [articles] featured headlines to that effect and quotes by the investigator Evangelos Michelakis lamenting how he had had difficulties finding funding to do the next step, clinical trials in cancer. As a result of these sensationalistic stories, unscrupulous “businessmen” sought to bring DCA to the masses. A frenzy of sorts was unleashed, with desperate cancer patients scrambling to find DCA.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Despite investigators’ concerns about potential difficulties in obtaining funding, DCA studies have been undertaken, and in 2010 the substance was in the news again after researchers published a
  <a href="http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/2/31/31ra34.abstract" target="_blank">
   paper
  </a>
  reporting their results with testing DCA on glioblastoma tumors:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The researchers looked at the impact of DCA on tumor cells from patients with an aggressive form of brain cancer called glioblastoma, which generally does not respond well to treatment.
  </p>
  <p>
   They performed some very sophisticated lab experiments which demonstrated the impact of DCA on the tumor cells from 49 patients with this cancer.  The experiments generally support the effectiveness of DCA at altering cell behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
   The investigators also treated five patients who had glioblastoma with DCA.  The only side effect they found was a reversible change in peripheral nerve function.  No other side effects were described.  Of the five patients, three had progressing disease despite prior treatment and two were newly diagnosed. Those two patients were treated with different protocols.  The results of the treatments were variable as were the approaches to treatment.  Nonetheless, the report shows some MRI pictures pre and post treatment which show regression of the cancers in two patients.

  of that last study in 2010, DCA studies appear to be worth pursuing, but the substance is still far from being proved an effective treatment for any type of cancer, much less a cancer “cure”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   How would I characterize this report?
  </p>
  <p>
   Simply stated, the science is intriguing and I believe is something to be pursued both in the lab and in the clinic.  BUT, and this is a big but, it is not a cure for glioblastoma or any other cancer based on these results.
  </p>
  <p>
   My concern is that this paper is going to be transformed — like the last one — into something that it is not, namely that this is definitive evidence that DCA is the magic bullet for cancer treatment, particularly in glioblastoma (which is a cancer that has a very poor prognosis).
  </p>
  <p>
   This research still needs lots of work before we know whether it works or doesn’t work, and whether it is really safe or not when given to patients with cancer under a variety of circumstances.
  </p>
  <p>
   If that sounds overly cautious, so be it.  I have seen too many dashed hopes in my medical career which make me a bit cautious about reports like this.  That’s not to say I don’t think it could work — it could, as I mentioned above — but I want to see evidence in well done trials that prove the point that DCA is effective in the treatment of which cancers under what circumstances.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the case of DCA, internet traffic zoomed with reports of its purported success in curing cancer — in lab animals.  Clinics sprung up, and are probably still active.  The risk is that we are going to see a resurgence of this now that the new report has been issued.
  </p>
  <p>
   We shall see how this progresses.  Hopefully, clinical trials will proceed appropriately.
  </p>
  <p>
   And I stand by my skepticism, while encouraging further research to answer the fundamental question whether or not DCA really works in treating cancer.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the meantime, caution is advised.  Don’t become the victim of a cancer scam.  The scamsters are sure to follow this report as night follows day.

  as recently as July 2016, dichloroacetate still has not lived up to the potential ascribed to it several years ago:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Almost a decade ago,
   <em>
    New Scientist
   </em>
   broke a story about dichloroacetate (DCA), a simple chemical used to treat rare metabolic disorders that was also showing remarkable cancer-killing properties. We were inundated with requests for more information — including how to enroll in clinical trials or buy the drug online.
  </p>
  <p>
   DCA was worth investigating as a cancer treatment, but [it] has yet to live up to its promise. The US Food and Drug Administration eventually had to step in and shut down websites selling it illegally.
