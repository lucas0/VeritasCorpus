  Do you know what they call Hillary’s campaign plane?  Broomstick One.  That’s the name for her campaign plane given by Secret Service and State Department agents because of how rudely she treated them.  This is in the emails as well, in addition to forthcoming books, that she was mean and rude and had no time for people she thought were there to serve her, foul mouth and liberal use of the F-word in dealing with these people, and they named her plane Broomstick One.
