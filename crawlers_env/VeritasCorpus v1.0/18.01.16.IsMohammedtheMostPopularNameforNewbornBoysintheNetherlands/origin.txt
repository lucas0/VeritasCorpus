  The mainstream media in the Netherlands reported last week that “Noah” was the most popular baby name for boys in the small European nation.

  “Noah and Emma were the most popular children’s names in the past year,” reported Nos.nl. “This is evident from the annual list of names of the Social Insurance Bank, which pays out the child benefit. Boys were named Noah 635 times, while 755 girls went through life as Emma since last year.” The year before, “Daan” and “Anna” were the most popular names, the site said.

  But a journalist at Powned.tv did a little research on the report and found something completely different. Checking for “Mohammed” — and all its alternative spellings — the writer found that 636 babies had been given that name last year.
