    Origins:
   </b>
  </span>
  A common (and unfortunately, effective) technique for luring e-mail users into opening virus-launching attachments is to send messages that would appear to be relevant or important to many of their potential recipients. One way of accomplishing this feat is to make the virus-carrying messages appear to come from some type of business entity that many people commonly deal with, such as one of the large Internet auction or retailing sites, or a national bank (or other financial institution), or a major provider of a common service.
 </p>
 <p>
  That last area usually comes into play around the winter holiday season, when e-mail users experience the onset of a
  <a href="http://www.mcafee.com/threat-intelligence/malware/default.aspx?id=132901" target="_blank">
   viruses
  </a>
  spread through messages purporting to come from parcel delivery companies such as the United Parcel Service (UPS) or Federal Express (FedEx). The bogus messages typically inform users about packages they have supposedly sent that could not be delivered due to incorrect recipient addresses and invite them to open and print out attached invoices in order to claim the undelivered packages. The messages include file attachments with names like ‘ups_invoice.zip’ that actually harbor malicious executable files (‘ups_invoice.exe’ or the like) and display as a Microsoft Word icon to make it appear like a harmless Word document and thereby lure recipients into clicking on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  A mass mailing of this type is bound to hit quite a few people who have shipped parcels in the recent past (especially around the holidays) and therefore might easily be lured into opening the virus-launching attachment, so UPS was quick to put up (and e-mail) a warning about the malicious messages:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Attention Virus Warning
   <br/>
   Service Update
  </p>
  <p>
   We have become aware there is a fraudulent email being sent that says it is coming from UPS and leads the reader to believe that a UPS shipment could not be delivered. The reader is advised to open an attachment reportedly containing a waybill for the shipment to be picked up.
  </p>
  <p>
   This email attachment contains a virus. We recommend that you do not open the attachment, but delete the email immediately.
  </p>
  <p>
   UPS may send official notification messages on occasion, but they rarely include attachments. If you receive a notification message that includes an attachment and are in doubt about its authenticity, please contact customerservice@ups.com.
  </p>
  <p>
   Please note that UPS takes its customer relationships very seriously, but cannot take responsibility for the unauthorized actions of third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thank you for your attention.

 <p>
  UPS currently has the following
  <a href="http://www.ups.com/content/us/en/about/news/service_updates/20110330_fraud.html" target="_blank">
   warning
  </a>
  on their web site about the phony e-mails:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Fraudulent Email Circulating
   <br/>
   Service Update
  </p>
  <p>
   Fraudulent emails adopt many different forms and are the unauthorized actions of third parties not associated with UPS. These email messages referred to as “phishing” or “spoofing” are becoming more common and may appear legitimate by incorporating company brands, colors, or other legal disclaimers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to other fraudulent emails two new email “spoofs” are currently circulating. One contains the subject line “United Parcel Service Notification” and the other states “Your Package Has Arrived!” Neither of these are legitimate UPS communications, and opening or clicking on the included attachment may result in the installation of malware onto your computer. If you receive these emails, do not follow any links provided or click on any attachments. Instead, simply delete the email.
  </p>
  <p>
   Please be advised that UPS does not request payments, personal information, financial information, account numbers, IDs, passwords, or copies of invoices in an unsolicited manner through email, mail, phone, or fax or specifically in exchange for the transportation of goods or services. UPS accepts no responsibility for any costs or charges incurred as a result of fraudulent activity.

  on their site:

  <p>
   Be alert for fraudulent e-mails claiming to be from FedEx regarding a package that could not be delivered. These e-mails ask the receiver to open an attachment in order to obtain the airbill or invoice for picking up the package. The attachment contained in this type of e-mail activates a virus. DO NOT OPEN the attachment. Instead, delete the e-mail immediately.These fraudulent e-mails are the unauthorized actions of third parties not associated with FedEx. When FedEx sends e-mails with tracking updates for undeliverable packages, we do not include attachments.

  A version aimed at DHL surfaced in late March 2009, prompting that company to post an
  <!--<A HREF="http://www.dhl-usa.com/custserv/servicealert.asp?id=1" TARGET=alert target="_blank">alert</A>-->
  alert on their web site:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Import Information Regarding Fraudulent Use of DHL Tracking eMailA fraudulent email is being distributed with the subject line “DHL tracking number” The email contains an attachment with a virus that should not be opened. Please delete the entire email and be advised that the package referred to does not exist and that DHL delivery services are operating normally.

 <p>
  Yet another version (cited in the ‘Examples’ section above) featuring messages purportedly originating with the United States Postal Service (USPS) began circulating in September 2010, with those messages asking recipients to print out a mailing label in order to lure them into opening the enclosed attachment (USPSlabel.zip) and activating the malware contained therein. The USPS posted a
  <a href="https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov/radDocs/consumer/SpamAlert.pdf" target="_blank">
   warning
  </a>
  about this version on its web site:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Some postal customers are receiving bogus e-mails about a package delivery. The e-mails contain a link that, when opened, installs a malicious virus that can steal personal information from your PC.The e-mails claim to be from the U.S. Postal Service and contain fraudulent information about an attempted or intercepted package delivery. You are instructed to click on a link to find out when you can expect your delivery. But Postal Inspectors warn: Do not click on the link!
  </p>
  <p>
   Like most viruses sent by e-mail, clicking on the link will activate a virus that can steal information — such as your user name, password, and financial account information.
  </p>
  <p>
   What to do? Simply delete the message without taking any further action. The Postal Inspection Service is working hard to resolve the issue and shut down the malicious program.

  As of March 2011, Canada Post was also
  <a href="http://www.canadapost.ca/cpo/mc/aboutus/news/announcements/emailscamalert.jsf" target="_blank">
   warning
  </a>
  of similar virus mailings:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Please be advised that if you received an email suggesting that Canada Post has shipped a package to you with the tracking number RT094860142HK, the email is fraudulent, likely contains a virus, and the package does not exist. Please do not click on the links or open any attachments.The email is not coming from Canada Post — Canada Post does not send an email confirmation that a package has been shipped. The anonymous authors of this unfortunate email virus are only using the Canada Post name to get your attention.
  </p>
  <p>
   Steps you can take to protect yourself if you receive an email from Canada Post:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    If you feel the email is suspicious, delete.
   </li>
   <li>
    If you are not expecting a package delivery by Canada Post, delete the email immediately.
   </li>
   <li>
    If you are expecting a package delivery by Canada Post, please do the following:
    <ul type="Disc">
     <li>
      If there is an attachment — delete the email immediately.
     </li>
     <li>
      If there is a tracking number included in the email, you can check it at www.canadapost.ca. If the tracking number is a fake, “Invalid Tracking Number format. Please check your entries and try again.” will appear on the screen in red letters. Delete the email.
