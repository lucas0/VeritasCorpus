  Holding a press conference one day before the 2016 election, Ivanka Trump publicly disavowed her father, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump today.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It is with great determination that I must officially disavow my father’s presidential campaign today,” said Ivanka Trump. “Before this campaign I was not fully aware of who my father was. Looking back now, the things he has said and done throughout his life are totally unconscionable.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it’s possible to know your father and not really know him at all, that describes my situation. My father is clearly not qualified to be president. By now that much should be obvious to anyone with a halfway working brain. If he was a contestant on the Celebrity Apprentice he would get fired in the first week. He is not a smart man.”
