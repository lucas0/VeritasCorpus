  Two mothers and Five children died in a fiery wreck in Hernando County today, while two injured fathers had to be held back from the flames trying to save their families, officials said.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two men were airlifted to a nearby hospital for burns they sustained while trying to save their families.

  The two men were later identified as Carter Anderson, 35, and Nathan Mcconaghy, 47. The identities of their wives and children weren’t released. The ages of the children were 1, 3, 6, 8 and 12 years old, according.

  The minivan carrying the two families collided with a black BMW and stopped on the far right shoulder of the freeway, still partially in the travel lane. The minivan was then rear-ended by a big rig, pushed into a ravine and caught fire.

  Two Patrol officers saw the van catch fire, and both husbands, who were able to escape, ran up to the officers, pleading for help.

  “Words can’t describe what that was like when we arrived on scene,” Officer Dan Williams said. “It was very horrific seeing them trying to get their families out, us trying to help get their families out. Like I said, the van went up in flames very, very quickly.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Williams and his partner tried to help the fathers rescue their loved ones, even using a fire extinguisher, but to no avail. They eventually had to hold the men back from the van.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both fathers suffered severe burns to their hands and faces.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was unclear what caused the initial crash with the BMW. The investigation was ongoing.
