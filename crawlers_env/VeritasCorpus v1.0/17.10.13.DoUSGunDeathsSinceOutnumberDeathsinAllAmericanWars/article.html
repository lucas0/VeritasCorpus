  In the aftermath of the 1 October 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, the American public attempted to come to grips with the scale of gun violence in the United States. One oft-cited statistic posted in social media by “

  reported similar figures:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   More Americans have died from gunshots in the last 50 years than in all of the wars in American history. Since 1968, more than 1.5 million Americans have died in gun-related incidents, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By comparison, approximately 1.2 million service members have been killed in every war in U.S. history, according to estimates from the Department of Veterans Affairs and
   <a href="http://icasualties.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
    iCasualties.org
   </a>
   , a website that maintains an ongoing database of casualties from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Different versions of this claim have been prominently offered in recent years by sources such as
  <em>
   New York Times
  </em>
  columnist Nicolas Kristof in 2015, and
  <em>
   PBS Newshour
  </em>
  contributor and commentator Mark Shields in 2012.
 </p>
 <p>
  All these claims contain casual uses of the qualifier “Americans” in reference to gun deaths, which is somewhat confusing because not everyone who has been killed by firearms in the United States was an American citizen, and official sources for gun death statistics do not offer breakdowns by nationality. Therefore, we assume that “Americans” is used here for rhetorical effect, rather than as a functional statistical category, and deal with the total number of gun deaths occurring in the United States since 1968.  Similarly, according to the historian
  <a href="http://time.com/3940428/civil-war-immigrant-soldiers/" target="_blank">
   Don H. Doyle
  </a>
  , the U.S. Civil War saw around 543,000 foreign-born (i.e., immigrant) soldiers fighting on the Union side alone, so a significant number of Civil War deaths might have involved non-American citizen combatants, but we’ll count them all as “Americans.”  (Indeed, non-U.S. citizens have likely served and died fighting for the U.S. side in every American military conflict since the Revolutionary War, but probably in much greater numbers during the Civil War than any other.)
 </p>
 <p>
  Support for this claim often uses sources that relate only to
  <em>
   combatant
  </em>
  deaths in wars and do not include civilian or other non-combatant deaths (the latter being figures which might also include non-U.S. citizens). One could argue that
  <em>
   civilian
  </em>
  deaths in wars should be included (although estimates of these deaths are much less reliable than for fatalities among military personnel), but we are limiting our analysis to include only combatant deaths in military conflicts.
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ll break this analysis into two parts: the total number of deaths in the United States involving firearms since 1968, and the number of deaths in  the U.S. and among American combatants across all wars in American history.

  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The estimated total number of firearms-related deaths from 1968-2016 is
  <strong>
   1.58 million
  </strong>
  . The official number for 1968-2015 is 1.55 million, and we have assumed the number of deaths in 2016 as being the mid-point between the two previous years (2014 and 2015).

  </li>
  <li>
   1999 to 2015: 533,879

  historians, the widely accepted figure for deaths in this conflict was reckoned as 618,222 for about a century. In 2011, however, J. David Hacker ( then of Binghamton University) published a significant upwards revision of that total, estimating that the likely death toll was between 650,000 and 851,000. Taking the mid-point in this estimate range assumes about 750,000

When it comes to <em>civilian</em> casualties, accurate estimates are hard to come by. The figures become particularly messy when you take into account deaths from disease and starvation, which may have resulted from military conflict, but were not battlefield fatalities.

James McPherson, a leading historian of the Civil War, estimates that there were 50,000 civilian deaths during that conflict (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=GXfGuNAvm7AC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">page 619</a>). Civilian fatalities from the other "domestic" wars - the Revolutionary War, Mexican-American War, Indian Wars and the War of 1812 - were either not available or not significant enough to make an impact on this analysis.&nbsp;
-->
 </p>
 <p>
  If we rely on the Department of Veterans Affairs summary, while accepting J. David Hacker’s 750,000 estimate for the Civil War, the total number of deaths among American combatants in all U.S. military conflicts, using high estimates for each, is thus
  <strong>
   1,481,862
  </strong>
  — about 100,000 less than the total number of firearms-related fatalities in the U.S. between 1968 and 2016.
 </p>
 <p>
  So even using the higher end of available estimates for war deaths throughout American history, the grand total of those deaths is still lower than the total of firearms-related fatalities since 1968, a period of just 49 years. Although this disparity between war deaths and gun deaths is smaller than the gap claimed by the Other 98% (200,000) or NBC News (300,000), the imprecision of casualty estimates (especially for the Civil War era) allows for a considerable margin of error.
