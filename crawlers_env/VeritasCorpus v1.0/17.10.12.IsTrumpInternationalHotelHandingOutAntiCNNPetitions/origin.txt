  There’s been a lot of misinformation about this. I did not stay at the hotel. I was there for drinks at the lobby bar. These flyers were being passed out. I have no idea who gave it to me. I don’t know if it was a staff member or not. Other people were handed the flyer in the bar. At first, I didn’t read it because I was talking to someone. I’m not a Trump supporter and after I read it I posted it on fb.

  This has gotten blown out of proportion a little bit.
