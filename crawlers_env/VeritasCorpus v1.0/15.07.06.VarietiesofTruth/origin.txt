<blockquote>
 <p>
  One afternoon a little girl, who had eagerly wished to go, turned back from the Sunday-school door, crying bitterly because there was no more
  <nobr>
   room …
  </nobr>
  [I] asked her why it was that she was crying, and she sobbingly replied that it was because they could not let her into the
  <nobr>
   Sunday-school …
  </nobr>
  I said to her that I would take her in, and I did so, and I said to her that we should some day have a room big enough for all who should come.
