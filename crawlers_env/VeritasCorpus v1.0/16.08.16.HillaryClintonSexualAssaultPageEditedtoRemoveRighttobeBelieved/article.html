  about Arkansas resident Juanita Broaddrick, who briefly came under scrutiny in the 1990s over a leaked assertion that in 1978 Bill Clinton (who was then serving as the state’s attorney general) had raped her.  Broaddrick didn’t speak up until many years later, and Clinton denied sexually assaulting her, so no criminal charges were ever brought. Broaddrick was mostly a footnote to Clinton’s Monica Lewinsky

   scandal
  </a>
  and was content to recede from  public attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  Juanita Broaddrick has been placed in the public eye once again, however, in part because on 14 September 2015 Hillary Clinton posted a tweet stating that every survivor of sexual assault had the “right to be heard” and “the right to be believed”:
 </p>
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en">

   “To every survivor of sexual assault…You have the right to be heard. You have the right to be believed. We’re with you.” —Hillary

  The tweet eventually came to Broaddrick’s attention, and on 6 January 2016 she sent what would become a widely circulated response to Clinton’s statement:
 </p>
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en">

   I was 35 years old when Bill Clinton, Ark. Attorney General raped me and Hillary tried to silence me. I am now 73….it never goes away. — Juanita Broaddrick (@atensnut)

  In a tense election cycle, the tweet slowly gained traction. On 9 August 2016, Broaddrick participated in a
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4wz1yz/juanita_broaddrick_here_ask_me_anything/" target="_blank">
   Reddit AMA
  </a>
  {Ask Me Anything] session about the controversy, and shortly afterwards
  <em>
   BuzzFeed
  </em>
  ‘s profile of her explained that Broaddrick’s plight had attracted some unlikely supporters:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In theory, partisan politics shouldn’t play a role in determining whether an alleged rape victim deserves to be heard. But lately, right-wing news outlets and conservative politicians with awful track records on women’s issues have treated Broaddrick’s story with the sensitivity of a
   <em>
    Feministing
   </em>
   blogger.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ann Coulter, who once said rape isn’t actually rape unless the victim has been “hit on the head with a brick,” tweeted in May: “BREAKING NEWS: BILL COSBY ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL FOR RAPE. Courage, Juanita, justice is coming.”
   <em>
    Breitbart
   </em>
   , which often criticizes other outlets for credulously reporting on public rape accusations, has written more than 30 favorable stories about Broaddrick this year alone. The
   <em>
    National Review
   </em>
   , which has run pieces about how rape accusations ruin lives and why believing the pop star Kesha’s rape claims is akin to “Stalinist finger-pointing,” published a piece calling Broaddrick’s allegations “credible” and “serious” despite a lack of formal charges or physical evidence.
  </p>
  <p>
   “The unwillingness of rape victims to admit their assault is a well-known phenomenon,” the author wrote.
  </p>
  <p>
   Their argument is that Broaddrick’s story is so solid that, as conservative
   <em>
    New York Times
   </em>
   columnist Ross Douthat wrote, one “need not be a ‘believe all rape allegations’ absolutist to find her claim persuasive.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  In 2016 the retired Arkansas woman’s name remained unknown to many voters too young to recall the tumultuous politics of the 1990s, and
  <em>
   BuzzFeed
  </em>
  provided what might have been the first comprehensive accounting of Broaddrick’s experiences.  They also prompted renewed interest into Hillary Clinton’s original 2015 statement about rape, and the subsequent discovery of an apparent change that was quietly made to a page about campus sexual assault hosted on the candidate’s web site.
