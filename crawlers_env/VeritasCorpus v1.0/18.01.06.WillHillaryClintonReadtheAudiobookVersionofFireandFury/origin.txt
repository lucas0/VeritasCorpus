  Alinsky Talent Agency announced this morning that one of their stable of stars has been tapped to record the audiobook version of author Michael Wolff’s bombshell investigative tell-all book, “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.”
 </p>

  Excerpts from the book paint a picture of a White House in total chaos. It portrays Trump as a borderline delusional man who lashes out, gets stuck in rhetorical loops, and cannot help himself from tweeting incendiary things, often over the advice of advisers in the administration.

  Ms. Clinton is not taking any payment for this job, the press release states, despite being a celebrity with a big enough name to command an easy six-figure or more sum for the work.
