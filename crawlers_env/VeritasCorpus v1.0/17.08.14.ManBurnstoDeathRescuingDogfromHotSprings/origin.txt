 <p>
  Firefighters received a call at about 4 p.m. of a man jumping into the Double Hot Springs at Black Rock Desert, Fire Chief Willard Gooch said.
 </p>
 <p>
  The man was taken to Renown Regional Medical Center via Care Flight, Gooch said. The extent of his injuries was not immediately known.
 </p>
 <p>
  “There’s three (hot springs) that’s out there that you can get pretty burned from,” Gooch said. “There are several out there that people need to pay attention to.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The hot springs at Black Rock Desert can be streams or deep ponds of boiling water, he said. The Double Hot Springs reach about 180 degrees with very steep and slippery banks, according to the Friends of Black Rock High Rock.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the area around the springs is fenced, dogs have been known to jump into or drink from the springs, the Friends of Black Rock said on the organization’s website.
 </p>
 <p>
  It [is not yet] known what type of dog jumped in the hot spring, whether the man owned it or if it survived the scalding hot water.
