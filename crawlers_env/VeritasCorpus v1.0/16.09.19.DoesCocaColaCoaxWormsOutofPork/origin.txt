  Infection used to be more common and was usually caused by ingestion of undercooked pork. However, infection is now relatively rare. During
  <nobr>
   2008-2010,
  </nobr>
  <nobr>
   20 cases
  </nobr>
  were reported per year on average. The number of cases decreased beginning in the
  <nobr>
   mid-20th century
  </nobr>
  because of legislation prohibiting the feeding of
  <nobr>
   raw-meat
  </nobr>
  garbage to hogs, commercial and home freezing of pork, and the public awareness of the danger of eating raw or undercooked pork products. Cases are less commonly associated with pork products and more often associated with eating raw or undercooked wild game meats.
