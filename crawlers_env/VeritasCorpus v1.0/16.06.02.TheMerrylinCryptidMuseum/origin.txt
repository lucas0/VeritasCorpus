 <p>
  Creepy skeletons of winged humans, bodies of mythical creatures and even aliens have been unearthed in a London home.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ghastly relics were the collection of Thomas Merrylin, an 18th century aristocrat with a taste for the unusual.
 </p>
 <p>
  They were apparently found sealed in the basement of a London house in 2006, and the macabre findings might just change science as we know it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now they’re being kept at the Merrylin Cryptid Museum, a bizarre collection of the artefacts that is almost guaranteed to creep you out.
