  The video you are about to watch below is quite disturbing. For the last eight years Costco has claimed that their egg supply came from hens who were cage free. The picture used on their cartons depict chickens roaming free in a beautiful field of grass. An undercover investigation by the Humane Society of the United States, sadly uncovered quite a different reality.

  If you are a Costco shopper, the shocking information reported in this footage, is critical for you to be aware of. It reveals that the egg suppliers for Costco keep their chickens in the very worst conditions imaginable â€¦ The cruel and unhealthy conditions for the chickens in the following footage, is not only harmful for the animals, but puts the consumer at great risk for Salmonella poisoning.

  The video is hard to watch, but making consumers aware of what Costco is selling, is essential in forcing them to make a change in the brand of eggs they are selling and misrepresenting.
