  an article reportedly reproducing a transcript of the self-aggrandizing toast Donald Trump supposedly delivered at his daughter Ivanka’s wedding:

   <em>
    I recently obtained a transcript of Trump’s toast at the wedding reception.  It is reprinted in its entirety below.

   “Okay, everybody, listen up.  Listen up. Good to see so many nice people here and isn’t this a beautiful golf course?  I built it in record time, by the way, and no debt.  Totally debt free.  Built it with Filipino workers. Great people, the Filipinos. Hard workers and when they complain about low wages, you can’t understand them.  Last year this course was ranked Number One in the world by people who rank things.  And I love people who rank things.  They’re amazing people. How ‘bout this food?  Great stuff.  Trump Steaks.  Trump Wine.  Trump Water.  Trump Radicchio.  Trump Truffles. Trump Aspic.  Beautiful food.  And if you’re feeling a little extra peppy, that’s because the room is filled with my newest product — Trump Oxygen.  What a turnout!  Some great people here. There’s Tommy LaSorda.  What an amazing, amazing talent.  He’s definitely my main paisan.  The great entertainer Tony Danza is here.  If you get a chance, check out his one-man show at the Palace Theater in Hoboken.  Tremendous dancing and great patter.  I love patter. And over there — Pete Rose.  Just a great, great human being.  Who, by the way, should be in the Hall of Fame.  Him not being in there is a disaster.  A total disaster.  He bet on some baseball games, big deal.  So my beautiful Ivanka got married today.  And, trust me, if I wasn’t her father I’d tap that ass.

  Although the
  <em>
   Daily Kos
  </em>
  typically publishes straight news and political commentary, they occasionally dabble in “snark.” While satirical pieces are usually labeled as such, the above-quoted transcript was published without any tagging or disclaimer specifically identifying it as humor.

 <p>
  The story’s author, “JoBo1531,” explained in the comments section that this was a first effort at penning material for the
  <em>
   Daily Kos
  </em>
  and may not have adhered to the site’s guidelines:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Jaxpagan: If this is snark, please add a snark tag. It’s become impossible to tell, and I don’t want to be unnecessarilty skeeved out.
  </p>
  <p>
   JoBo1531: Yes, snark. It’s my first post on Kos so I’m still unsure about the etiquette.
