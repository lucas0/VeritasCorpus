  Photographs purportedly showing a “tiger with Down syndrome” have been circulating around the internet for several years. While these images are real, the animal’s appearance is not the result of

  <p>
   The diagnosis of Down’s Syndrome is also questionable. Down’s Syndrome results from a third copy of chromosome 21. Although a mouse model for Down’s Syndrome exists, tigers have 19 chromosomes to humans’ 23. While Kenny’s face does bear a superficial resemblance to that seen in people with Down’s Syndrome, it’s far from clear that this was the result of a third copy of any chromosome, let alone one that could be matched to our 21

   What is clear is that Kenny was a victim of the greed of the breeding industry. White tigers are very rare. With so few of them, the genetic pool is limited, and inbreeding is an inevitable consequence. Kenny’s parents were brother and sister. Most of his siblings were stillborn, or died very young, according to Patricia Quinn, a spokesperson for Turpentine Creek Wildlife Reserve, where Kenny lived from the age of two.

  The Association of Zoos and Aquariums banned the inbreeding of white tigers in 2011, explaining that the

  Kenny was ten years old when he died — about half the lifespan of a normal tiger.
