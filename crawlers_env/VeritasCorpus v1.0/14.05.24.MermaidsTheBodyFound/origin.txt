  The thing that’s got my goat at the moment is a fake documentary on Animal Planet called
  <em>
   Mermaids: The Body Found
  </em>
  . It has actors playing scientists talking about how they did an autopsy on some mermaid remains, and how the US government swooped and covered the whole thing up. There’s grainy fake video of mermen being hauled up in fishing nets, the whole box and dice.
 </p>
 <p>
  The version that I saw doesn’t even do viewers the courtesy of admitting that it’s fake until the credits are about to roll.
 </p>
 <p>
  It starts off talking up the rather fringe “aquatic ape” notion of human evolution and ends up with some classic-looking CGI mermaids that make zero evolutionary sense. From the waist up they’re slender modern humans (no insulating blubber? Brrr!), while from the waist down they’re
  <nobr>
   dolphins — and
  </nobr>
  to top it all off they’ve got a dolphin-like sonar system inside their skulls. Over what period of time is all this supposed to have happened? A few tens of thousands of years? A few hundred thousand years?
 </p>
 <p>
  The documentary makes much of the fact that whales evolved from terrestrial ancestors, but that took millions of years, not the kind of evolutionary eyeblink that Mermaids seems to be talking about.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not that there’s anything wrong with a bit of speculative evolution, as long as you make it clear from the outset that you’re making stuff up.
