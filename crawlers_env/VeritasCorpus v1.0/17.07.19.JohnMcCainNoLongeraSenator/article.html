  On 12 July 2017, the US News House web site published a
  <a href="http://archive.is/IxAKd" target="_blank">
   report
  </a>
  with the headline: “Just In: John McCain is NO LONGER A SENATOR.”
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Five and a half years after Senator John McCain killed off what was left of The Maverick — the independent-thinking, “not afraid to tell it like it is” character he’d been LARPing since the 2000 Republican primary — in order to win a contentious primary against Tea Party challenger J.D. Hayworth, he’s facing the prospect of the end of his career once again.
  </p>
  <p>
   This time, it’s against a state senator who’s perfectly content with grifting votes at a Donald Trump rally. McCain’s seat has been targeted by conservative groups for years now to no avail, but this time, it’s a fair question to ask if McCain’s heart is in it anymore.

  The same article was republished four days later by the
  <a href="http://archive.is/JhwGy" target="_blank">
   Royal Column
  </a>
  and
  <a href="http://archive.is/8joXc" target="_blank">
   Conservative Army
  </a>
  web sites. Those web sites don’t repeat or provide any evidence for the claim made in the headline – that McCain had left office.
 </p>
 <p>
  The headline is no more than click-bait, and the article itself consists entirely of material copied and pasted from a January 2016 Salon.com

   opinion piece
  </a>
  by Paul Blest.
 </p>
 <p>
  The article mentions McCain’s 2010 Republican primary victory over former U.S. Congressman J.D. Hayworth and says “this time,” he’s facing a state senator. This is a reference to Kelli Ward, the former Arizona State Senator who challenged John McCain in the 2016 Senate primary, and whom McCain ultimately defeated.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s possible the 18-month-old opinion piece was plagiarized in July 2017 amid concerns over the Arizona senator’s health. McCain is 80 years old, and underwent
