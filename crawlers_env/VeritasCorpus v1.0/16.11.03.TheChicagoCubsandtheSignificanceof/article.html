   The “Billy Goat Curse” started on 8 October (10/8) when Billy Goat Tavern owner William Sianis sent a telegram to P.K. Wrigley. UNPROVEN
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  There are many variations of this story. The timeline makes sense, as Sianis and his goat were supposedly turned away from Wrigley Field on 6 October 1945, but we haven’t been able to verify the date he sent the telegram or its contents. One version of the tale states that Sianis sent his telegram “immediately” after he was denied entry, not two days later:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In one version, Sianis had gone straight to a telegraph office and sent a telegram to Philip K. Wrigley stating “you are going to lose this World Series and you are never going to win another World Series again. You are never going to win a World Series again because you insulted my goat.” [Chicago columnist Mike] Rokyo repeated the story again and again in his columns, though in one of his last columns before his death in 1997, he said that the curse was actually nonsense; just a good story and nothing more. The real curse, he said was brought down on the Cubs from above because the owners were reluctant to hire black ballplayers for years following Jackie Robinson.
