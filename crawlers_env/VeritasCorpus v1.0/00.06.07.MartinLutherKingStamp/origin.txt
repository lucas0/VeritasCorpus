  Subject: Dr King’s Stamp
 </p>
 <p>
  Please pass the word. A new 33-cent stamp is available to celebrate Dr. King’s historic MARCH ON WASHINGTON.
 </p>
 <p>
  Let’s purchase this STAMP! It takes years to build up trust, and only seconds to destroy it. The clerks will not market these stamps, unless you ask for them, and they will be recalled if the post office does not make money from them!
 </p>
 <p>
  Support your own . . . we can’t begin to imagine what this country was like before the 1960s.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was asked to pass this on, I’m asking you to do the same.
