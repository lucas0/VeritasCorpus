  Our vision is to end the deportations of Deported Veterans, repatriate the ones who have already been deported, and offer support until they all go home.

 <p>
  We shouldnâ€™t honor our Deported Veterans by allowing them to return upon death. Honor them by allowing them to return home to their families and give them any benefits that they are eligible for.
