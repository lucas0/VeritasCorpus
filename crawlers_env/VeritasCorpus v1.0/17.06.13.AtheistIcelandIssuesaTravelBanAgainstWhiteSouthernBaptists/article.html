  On 6 June 2017, the web site Patheos
  <em>
  </em>
  published a satirical
  <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/laughingindisbelief/2017/06/iceland-issues-travel-ban-southern-baptists/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  saying that Iceland had issued a travel ban preventing white Southern Baptists from visiting the country:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   This secular island country situated in the North Atlantic passed a law yesterday preventing white Southern Baptists from entering the country.Officials state that the United States of America is a country in turmoil and Southern Baptists are the ones mostly responsible. Atheist Iceland considers itself to be taking a stand for human rights by not tolerating foreign nationals who seek to undermine democracy.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Patheos largely focuses on
  <a href="http://www.patheos.com/About-Patheos/About" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   religion
  </a>
  and spirituality, but it also has a non-religious section that includes humor pieces. The particular piece was published in the Laughing in Disbelief
  <em>
  </em>
  section and linked to a
  <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/laughingindisbelief/is-this-satire/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   disclaimer
  </a>
  stating that the content was satirical:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Have you clicked a link to a story and you’re here?
  </p>
  <p>
   The story you are reading is satirical. The post may have links to real events that the satire is based on, but the Laughing in Disbelief article is fake.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are
   <em>
    winks
   </em>
   to readers in each piece besides the link(s) to this page that I humbly offer as hints that the story in question is satirical.

  A few of the “winks” from this story include:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The President of Iceland is not named Lars Bork. (His real
   <a href="http://www.forseti.is/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
    name
   </a>
   is Guðni Th. Jóhannesson.)
  </li>
  <li>
   Iceland is not an atheist country. (80% of its
   <a href="http://www.iceland.is/the-big-picture/quick-facts" target="_blank">
    citizens
   </a>
   are members of the Lutheran State Church.)
  </li>
  <li>
   U.S. Republicans have not demanded that the country rename skyr, an Icelandic dairy product, “Freedom Yogurt” as the article claims.
  </li>
 </ul>
