  In light of recent violence, multiple nations are urging their citizens to be careful when traveling to the United States.

  Following a mass shooting in Orlando, the deaths of two young black men at the hands of police officers in Louisiana and Minnesota, and the killing of five police officers in Dallas over the past few weeks, several countries have urged their citizens to proceed with caution if they’re visiting the United States. First, after a man from the United Arab Emirates who was in Ohio for medical treatment was falsely accused of being a terrorist because he was speaking Arabic on the phone, the U.A.E. cautioned its citizens to avoid traditional dress abroad “to ensure their safety.”

  Now, the U.A.E. has been joined by Bahrain and the Bahamas, both of whom issued travel warnings over the weekend. On Twitter, Bahrain’s embassy in Washington, D.C. wrote, “Please be cautious of protests or crowded areas occurring around the US,” and listed emergency contact numbers for the embassy. The government of the Bahamas issued a statement as well: “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration has taken note of the recent tensions in some American cities over shootings of young black males by police officers. We wish to advise all Bahamians traveling to the US but especially to the affected cities to exercise appropriate caution generally.”
