  On 11 July 2016, several web sites such as
  <em>
   Vanguardngr.com
  </em>
  published articles reporting that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump had called Serena Williams his “black American woman friend” on Twitter after the tennis star won yet another Wimbledon title:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Trump took to twitter to announce that he had quite a lot of black American friends and that Serena, who recently won her 22 major tennis title, was one of his favorites.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I have many, many, many black friends. Nice people. My favorite black American woman friend just won Wimbledon…” He tweeted.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, Serena swiftly replied Trump’s tweet refuting his claim and demanding that he stops thinking and saying that.
  </p>
  <p>
   “No, no, no. I am not your black american woman friend. Stop saying that. Stop thinking that. Just stop.” She wrote.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  This Twitter exchange never took place, however.  The tale originated with a Facebook post from the web site
  <em>
