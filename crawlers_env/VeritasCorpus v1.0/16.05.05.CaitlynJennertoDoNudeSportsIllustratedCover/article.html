  On 5 May 2016,
  <em>
   Us Weekly
  </em>
  published an article reporting that Caitlyn Jenner was slated to pose nearly nude on the cover of
  <em>
   Sports Illustrated
  </em>
  (covered only by her medal and an American flag):
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Now that’s a patriotic streak!
  </p>
  <p>
   Caitlyn Jenner will appear on a summer cover of Sports Illustrated wearing “nothing but an American flag and her Olympic medal,” a source reveals in the latest issue of Us Weekly.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 66-year-old I Am Cait star (formerly known as Bruce) set a world decathlon record at the 1976 Montreal Summer Games. To celebrate the 40th anniversary of her win, she’ll pose with her gold medal for the first time post-transition, adds the source: “She’s excited about that.” (Her ex-wife Kris appeared topless with a medal during a 2007 photo shoot on Keeping Up With the Kardashians.)

 </blockquote>

  The item was purportedly leaked by a “source,” but the relation of the source to the claim was suspiciously missing, along with any credible sources. It wasn’t apparent from the article whether the leaker was a Kardashian-Jenner contact, someone affiliated with
  <em>
   Sports Illustrated
  </em>
  , or just a random individual. From there, the claim made its way to the

  , and numerous other outlets.
 </p>
 <p>
  No article further corroborated the claim, and all versions appeared to come from the same comments made by one anonymous source. Jenner made no reference to the rumor on her infrequently used Twitter

  <em>
   Sports Illustrated
  </em>
  does photo spreads that are little more risqué than the average bikini.
