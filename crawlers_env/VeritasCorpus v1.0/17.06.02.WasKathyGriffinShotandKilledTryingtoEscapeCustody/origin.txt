   The FBI took Kathy Griffin into custody without issue this morning in West Tisdale. Griffin, who is under suspicion of radicalizing American kids to join the jihadist movement, decided to do something incredibly stupid, however, when she tried to run from agents at a rest stop just outside of Delhomme.

  Agent Judy Nishto, who was on scene to assure that Griffinâ€™s rights as a female were being adhered to, ended up firing the shot that brought Griffin down.
