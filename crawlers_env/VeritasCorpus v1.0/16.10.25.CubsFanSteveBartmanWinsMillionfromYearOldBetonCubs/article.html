  On 25 October 2016, the Satira Tribune web site published an

  an article reporting that notorious Cubs fan Steve Bartman had won a $3.7 million wager after the Chicago Cubs defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers to earn their first World Series appearance in more than 70 years:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Infamous Cubs fan Steve Bartman won $3.7 million dollars on a bet he made on the Cubs 9 years ago in Las Vegas. At the time, the odds were 25000:1 but Bartman predicted the Cubs would defeat the Dodgers in 6 games in the year 2016. And that happened Saturday night in Chicago.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Vegas sports bookie issued a check for $3.7 million to Mr. Bartman. He can win an additional $22.5 million if the Cubs beat the Indians in 7 games this World Series.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <em>
    Nevada Reporter
   </em>
   interviewed Bartman who said, “It was a five dollar bet. I was a little drunk and the bookie egged me into to. I finally said ‘you know what? The Cubs will win the Pennant in 2016 against the Dodgers’, and they did. Guess who has the last laugh now.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  There was no truth to this story.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bartman, who infamously interfered with a fly ball during the National League Championship Series in 2003 (and was widely blamed for costing the Cubs the pennant), did not place a $5 bet in Las Vegas in 2005 that the Chicago Cubs would beat the Los Angeles Dodgers to win the pennant in 2016, he didn’t give a recent interview to the
  <em>
   Nevada Reporter
  </em>
  , and he did not win $3.7 million.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   The Satira Tribune
  </em>
  is a fake news web site that publishes “satirical and futuristic news.”

 <p>
  While Bartman’s $3.7 million World Series prediction originated with a fake news story, another Chicago Cubs prediction that made its way around the internet in October 2016 appeared to be
