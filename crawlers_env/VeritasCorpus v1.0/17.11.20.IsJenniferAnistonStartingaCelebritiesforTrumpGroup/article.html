  Here’s a glimpse into a particularly brazen attempt at producing “clickbait” by making a huge claim about a beloved celebrity with an attraction-grabbing headline that is literally unrelated to the story underneath.
 </p>
 <p>
  A 17 November 2017 post on the web site ConservativeSociety.net bore a headline that featured a quote misattributed to actress Jennifer Aniston: “Me and All The Trump Supporter Celebrities Decide To Make A Company Named ‘Celebrities For Trump,’ Which Fight Against All Anti Trump Celebrities, I Think President Trump Needs Our Support.”

  The idea, presumably, was that viewers would distribute the post online based solely on their reaction to the headline rather than the underlying story — because that story does not include Aniston’s fabricated “quote,” and no interview, no publication, nor any other proof of her interest in this subject is offered.
 </p>
 <p>
  To boot, this piece of clickbait appeared to be a mishmash of off-topic information and wholesale reproduction of another site’s work.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of a reported story, the story under the headline opened seemingly in the middle of a recap of a December 2016

  Four paragraphs later, the story turned into a “report” on a rumored collaboration between Aniston and singer Sheryl Crow on a clothing line. But this text was taken, verbatim, from a 26 October 2017

 <blockquote>

   The word-for-word use of our story, which is clearly unrelated to Donald Trump, is a clear example of willful copyright infringement. We plan to seek all legal remedies and demand the site remove our material immediately.
