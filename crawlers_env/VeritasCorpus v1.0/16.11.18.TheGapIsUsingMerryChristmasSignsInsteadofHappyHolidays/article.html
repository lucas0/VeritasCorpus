  planned to “ditch political correctness” and put signs inside their stores saying, “Merry Christmas” instead of the more inclusive “Happy `holidays.” The “story” was copied-and-pasted by another site,

  concerning an alleged letter sent by Bill Chandler, who was at the time vice-president for global corporate affairs, to the conservative American Family Association (AFA) announcing the change:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   As we near the holiday season I want to update you on how Gap, Inc.’s family of brands will celebrate the Christmas season. As a global retailer, we embrace the diversity of our customers and respect a variety of traditions and faith during the holidays, including Christmas.
  </p>
  <p>
   Starting today, every Gap Outlet window will have signs that say “Merry Christmas” along with Christmas trees and wreaths throughout their stores.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
