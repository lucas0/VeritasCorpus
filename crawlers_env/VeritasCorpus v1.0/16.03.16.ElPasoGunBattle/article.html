  Since at least November 2009, photographs purporting to show the gruesome aftermath of an attempted robbery in El Paso, Texas, have been circulated online. According to the text that typically accompanies these images, the pictures depict three armed Mexicans (variously described a “gang members,” “thugs,” or “illegals”) who crossed the U.S. border into Texas and attempted to rob a random person they encountered on the streets of El Paso. Unfortunately for them, their intended victim was an off-duty El Paso police officer who pulled out his weapon and shot his three assailants dead, thereby saving U.S. taxpayers thousands upon of dollars in incarceration and trial fees.

 <p>
  These photographs, however, don’t depict an incident that took place in El Paso, or in Texas, or anywhere else in United States. They originated with a violent crime that occurred in Brazil in 2008, which was indeed reported by that country’s news media as an attempted robbery which ended with two of the three would-be assailants shot dead.

  Contextual clues in the images suggest a locale other than the United States. For example, a building in the background of one photograph displays a logo for “Gravia,” a Brazilian manufacturing

   company

  . Likewise, a nearby phone booth displays the common green, rounded

   Three fewer doing shit in the city … Yesterday afternoon (15/09/2008) they decided to assault someone from Civil Police DOE (Department of Special Operations) without knowing who he was and took his money that was in a backpack and fled on a motorcycle. Two were killed on the spot and the one who lived took a .40 bullet  in both arms, but unfortunately he has already gone through surgery. Excellent work from a prepared police officer with the cold blood to act at the right time.
