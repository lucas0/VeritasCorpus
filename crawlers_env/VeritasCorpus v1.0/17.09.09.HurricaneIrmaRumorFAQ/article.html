   Hurricane Irma
  </a>
  was the second major hurricane of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season (after Hurricane Harvey), and the storm brought with it

   dire predictions
  </a>
  that prompted mass evacuations, widespread preparedness activity, and strongly-worded

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Whether it will actually endure a storm of that size and violence isn’t clear. As of Friday morning, Hurricane Irma, one of the strongest hurricanes ever measured in the Atlantic Ocean, was predicted to tear through South Florida and up the center of the state. If forecasts hold, it could be the most ferocious storm seen in the Sunshine State since Hurricane Andrew cut east-to-west across its peninsula a quarter-century ago.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Irma has me sick to my stomach,” said Eric Blake, a scientist with the National Hurricane Center, on his personal Twitter account on Thursday evening. “This hurricane is as serious as any I have seen. No hype, just the hard facts. Take every lifesaving precaution you can.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “I have little doubt Irma will go down as one of the most infamous in Atlantic hurricane history,” he added.

  As is typically the case with events that can produce widespread damage and destruction, news about Hurricane Irma has been peppered with misinformation, hoaxes, and images of dubious veracity, prompting us to compile some of the most frequently asked reader questions about that potentially devastating weather phenomenon:

   executive order
  </a>
  that does authorize the National Guard to seize firearms and other property if he deems it necessary to keep public order.
 </p>
 <h3>
  <strong>
   Q: Did the 2005 film
   <em>
    Category 7: The End of the World
   </em>
   feature hurricanes named Harvey and Irma, revealing a conspiracy of weather manipulation?

Any truth to this? And, if so, why isn't anyone covering it?</blockquote>
