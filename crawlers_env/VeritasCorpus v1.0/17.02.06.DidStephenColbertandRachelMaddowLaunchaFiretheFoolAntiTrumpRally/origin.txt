 <p>
  On April 1st, 2017, We the People will gather at Declaration Demonstrations in Washington DC and all over the world to remind Mr. Trump and the entirety of the United States government that THEY work for US. The same power we give them, we
  <em>
   will
  </em>
  take away. Join us for this incredible event, if you can in Washington DC, if you can’t — wherever you live. Look to the “join us” page for further info on how you can make your voice heard and participate in what we hope to grow to the single largest political protest in history. We will not fall to tyranny and authoritarianism. The people will rise.
