  It’s one thing that one of the Challenger’s crew members resembles someone alive today. For that, we can chalk it up to a coincidence.

 <p>
  Itâ??s another thing entirely that SIX members of the Challenger crew have doppelgÃ¤ngers who are alive, in some cases with exactly the same names (Richard Scobee, Michael J. Smith, Judith Resnick, Sharon McAuliffe). What are the chances of that?

  You don’t have to be an expert in mathematics to know that those odds defy statistical probability.
