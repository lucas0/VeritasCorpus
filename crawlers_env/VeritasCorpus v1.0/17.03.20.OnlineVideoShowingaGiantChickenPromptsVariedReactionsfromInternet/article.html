  The video was not shared with any information about where or when it was filmed, leaving many viewers skeptical that the animal featured in the video was real.

  The first iteration of this video that we could uncover was posted to the Facebook group “

  The same Facebook group contained several images of similarly large birds, and at least one video apparently showing the same chicken from another angle.
