 <p>
  According to a lawsuit filed Monday in Leon Circuit Court, it was Hillary Clinton who won the state of Florida, not Donald Trump. In an attempt to overturn the election results, Floridians have filed a motion for a recount in their state.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to the Detroit Free Press, “hacking, malfunctioning voting machines, and other problems” are sole the reason Hillary Clinton lost that day.
 </p>
 <p>
  The voters are asking for a recount of every ballot submitted in the state of Florida. The defendants listed in the lawsuit are “Trump, Gov. Rick Scott and the 29 Republican presidential electors from Florida.” The lawsuit also asks that the defendants pay for the total cost of the recount.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clint Curtis is an attorney representing the plaintiffs … [the] Orlando attorney says that he has received multiple reports of malfunctions on election day, and that it is entirely possible that Donald Trump did not really win Florida.
