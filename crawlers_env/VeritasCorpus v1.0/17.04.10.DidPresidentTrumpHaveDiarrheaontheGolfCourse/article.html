 <blockquote>
  <p>
   President Trump had a little accident on the golf course today, and no, and wasn’t politically. After a large brunch of eggs, bacon, ham, pheasant, roast beef, elk, and a variety of sausage, Trump had a case of diarrhea while playing the 5th hole of his back nine.

   A golden color cart drove up and escorted Trump back to the side entrance of Mar-a-lago.

   “It wasn’t pretty,” said one golfer.

  <p>
   “It was pretty funny,” said another.
