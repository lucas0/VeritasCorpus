  In September of 2015, Donald Trump was asked about his stance on the legality of burning our flag.

 <p>
  “Personally, I don’t think it should be legal,” the Republican presidential front-runner [said] last year. Yet, now we have more examples than we need of this treason.

  The United States Supreme Court has ruled that flag burning is constitutionally protected freedom of speech. Now that Donald Trump will be appointing several Conservative Judges to serve on the Court, we can expect that ruling to

   change
  </em>
  in the coming year or so.

  On top of Trump’s comments a year ago, senior members in his administration have indicated President Trump has now made this issue one of this top priorities. Sources argue that soon after President Trump assembles his cabinet and has a Supreme Court Judge nominated, they will move this issue forward immediately to prosecute anyone caught burning the American flag.
