  Samsung Pays Apple $1 Billion Sending

   30 Trucks

  Full of

  Coins

 <p>
  This morning more than 30 trucks filled with
  <nobr>
   5-cent
  </nobr>
  coins arrived at Appleâ€™s headquarters in California. Initially,  the security company that protects the facility said the trucks were in the wrong place, but minutes later, Tim Cook (Apple CEO) received a call from Samsung CEO explaining that  they will pay
  <nobr>
   $1 billion
  </nobr>
  dollars for the fine recently ruled against the South Korean company in this way.
 </p>
 <p>
  The funny part is that the signed document does not specify a single payment method, so Samsung is entitled to send the creators of the iPhone their billion dollars in the way they deem best.
