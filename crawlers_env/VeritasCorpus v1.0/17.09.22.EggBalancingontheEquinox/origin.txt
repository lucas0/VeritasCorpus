  Egg balancing, most popular at the spring equinox in March but said to be possible in both seasons, has attracted publicity in recent years — with scientists skeptical and ritual-makers adamant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally a scientist has published research into the matter and concluded that yes indeed, he could balance an egg — actually several eggs — at the moment of the equinox.
 </p>
 <p>
  But, on the other side of the coin, he was also able to do so at lots of other times.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The upshot is that, as far as I can tell, there isn’t too much relationship between astronomical phenomena and balancing eggs. It is basically a function of the shape of the egg and the surface,” said astronomer Frank D. Ghigo.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ghigo, of the University of Minnesota, decided to study egg balancing after receiving questions about it from members of the public who had read about the annual spring egg balancing festival in New York City.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ghigo used four samples of a dozen eggs each, which he attempted to balance on their large ends on a Formica tabletop each day between Feb. 27 and April 3, 1984. The spring equinox occurred on March 20, 1984.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ghigo found the eggs have many bumps and irregularities and with patience some of them could be made to balance virtually every day — while some eggs would simply never balance, on the equinox or otherwise.
 </p>
 <p>
  He concluded that “the mood and persistence of the balancer has a major effect on the balancing rate. If one is impatient or nervous, the rate is low.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Over time, Ghigo found, the percentage of eggs he could balance improved, concluding “I think I got better, just through practice.”
