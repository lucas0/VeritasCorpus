  While the web vulnerability is amusing, it points to a very real and very serious issue: the Trump administration continues to make basic mistakes because of Trumpâ€™s failure to hire the best people, staffing his campaign and the White House with opportunists and incompetent cronies instead. The security of our country and of the world depend upon the competence of the people occupying the White House. Trump is not living up to even the minimum standards the American people deserve.
