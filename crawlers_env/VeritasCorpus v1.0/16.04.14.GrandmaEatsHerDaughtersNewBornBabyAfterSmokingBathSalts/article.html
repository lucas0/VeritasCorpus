  In April 2016, several web sites such as
  <em>
   Now 8 News
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Top Rated Viral

   A New Jersey grandmother of 8 and recovering drug addict, is now in custody after she allegedly ate her daughter’s newborn baby. Gretchen Schneider, 64, was babysitting her 4-week old granddaughter and was unknowingly under the influence of drugs, according to her daughter Amber Williams. When Williams dropped off her infant with her mother, she said she never expected anything like this.

  The
  <em>
   Now 8 News
  </em>
  site mimics the appearance of a local television news web site, but it does not include a readily available disclaimer and is a well-known

   purveyor

  of fake news. The site has previously published hoax stories about a man having
