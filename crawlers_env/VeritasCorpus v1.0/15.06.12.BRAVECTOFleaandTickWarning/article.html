  the status update above, warning dog owners about the purported dangers of BRAVECTO chewable flea and tick remedy.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to that update, the family of the depicted dog asserted that one of their pets had died within a day of being given BRAVECTO chewables and that another of their dogs had nearly died after being given the same treatment at the same time. The update also asserted that BRAVECTO chewables were responsible for the dog’s death and that several other dogs had died of liver and kidney failure shortly after taking the same medication. (No information was provided showing or explaining a causal link between the dead dog and BRAVECTO chewables other than a

  Bravecto (fluralaner) is a systemic antiparasitic drug introduced to the veterinary market by Merck in 2014. A 7 March 2014

  (based upon a study of 32 beagles treated with fluralaner) observed no serious adverse side effects attributed to the medication:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Oral administration of fluralaner, formulated as a chewable tablet, to healthy dogs at dose rates of up to 281.3 mg/kg on three occasions at 8-week intervals did not lead to any treatment-related findings that could be detected through careful clinical observation, clinical pathological evaluation or on gross or microscopic post mortem examination. Oral administration of fluralaner at the highest recommended treatment dose (56 mg/kg) is well tolerated by dogs and has a safety margin of more than five in healthy dogs eight weeks of age or older and weighing at least 2 kg.

  ] dated 15 May 2014 available on the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) web site reiterates the results of that study:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   There were no clinically-relevant, treatment-related effects on physical examinations, body weights, food consumption, clinical pathology (hematology, clinical chemistries, coagulation profiles and urinalysis), gross pathology, histopathology, or organ weights. Diarrhea, mucoid and bloody feces were the most common observations in this study, occurring at a similar incidence in the treated and control groups. Five of the twelve treated dogs that experienced one or more of these signs did so within 6 hours of the first dosing. One dog in the 3X group was observed to be dull, inappetent, with evidence of bloody diarrhea, vomiting and weight loss beginning five days following the first dose. One dog in the 1X group vomited food four hours following the first dose.

  a status update addressing rumors about the drug’s safety. In that update, Dr. Michael Mogavero stated that the drug had been extensively tested prior to its release and had proved safe for dogs:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   We have been hearing some alarming statements made about the flea and tick medication, Bravecto.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dr. Michael Mogavero states the following:
  </p>
  <p>
   “After having read some of the posts on facebook regarding the safety of Bravecto, I felt it reasonable to make those of you who are concerned, aware of some information that you should know about this product.
  </p>
  <p>
   Let me first say that veterinary pharmaceutical companies take the reporting of adverse reactions very seriously and are obligated by law to document all. Should you feel that your pet has had one please report it to your veterinarian as soon as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bravecto has been available worldwide for almost 18 months, in the United States for 1 year and here in Canada for about 8 months. To date, virtually all adverse reactions that have been seen or reported pertain to the gastrointestinal system, ie vomiting, decreased appetite, diarrhea, lethargy, excessive drinking and gas.
  </p>
  <p>
   The active ingredient fluralaner, works by inhibiting the nervous system of insects. It does not have any effect on the nervous system of animals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fluralaner will in fact pass through both the liver and kidneys but is not metabolized by either and is excreted in feces, in the same form as it was ingested unaltered.
  </p>
  <p>
   The literature and clinical use supports that Bravecto is safe, and consider for a moment all the animals that will not be infected by and succumb to the growing number of tick borne disease that we are seeing worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a practicing veterinarian I have prescribed this product within confidence in both its safety and efficacy. I am 100% confident that should there be any real concern with respect to this product the manufacturer will advise us without hesitation. Your pets health remain both mine and the health care team at Merck Animal Healths primary concern.”
