  On 5 June 2017, the
  <a href="http://archive.is/56Feo" target="_blank">
   Red State Watcher
  </a>
  web site posted two articles featuring a video that appeared to show Londoners chanting U.S. President Donald Trump’s name in the aftermath of a
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2017/06/03/police-say-terror-attack-london-reports-fatalities/">
   terrorist attack
  </a>
  in the city two days earlier, which left at least victims dead, as well as the three attackers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="http://archive.is/xz7wY" target="_blank">
   One article
  </a>
  carried the headline “Wow! Londoners chant President Trump’s name instead of mayor,” and
  <a href="http://archive.is/56Feo" target="_blank">
   another
  </a>
  was headlined “Sadiq Khan May Be In Trouble – Look What Londoners Are Doing!”
 </p>
 <p>
  That story went on to claim:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Londoners are fed up [with] Sadiq’s [sic] Khan’s soft stance on terrorism. As British citizens die, Kahn [sic] tells the public “not to be alarm.” [sic] This did not settle well with some citizens.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some Londoners took [to] the streets and instead of chanting Khan’s name, they chanted Donald Trump’s.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Both stories included the following video:
 </p>

  The articles, the posting of the video, and the text that accompanied it – which labelled London Mayor Sadiq Khan an “embarrassment” – all came in the context of a high-profile dispute between Khan and Trump.
 </p>
 <p>
  The morning after the attack, Trump grossly misrepresented comments made by
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2017/06/04/london-mayor-sadiq-khan-no-reason-to-be-alarmed-trump/">
   Khan
  </a>
  , claiming that the London Mayor had told the people of the British capital there was “no reason to be alarmed” at the attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, Khan was referring specifically to increased police patrols on the streets of London, and reassuring its residents not to be unduly concerned by that escalation.
 </p>
 <p>
  A spokesperson for the London Mayor then issued a
  <a href="https://twitter.com/guardian/status/871377154830946304" target="_blank">
   statement
  </a>
  calling Trump’s tweet “ill-informed” and accusing him of deliberately taking Khan’s comments out of context.
 </p>
 <p>
  The following day,
  <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/871725780535062528" target="_blank">
   Trump
  </a>
  doubled down on his attack, saying the mayor’s explanation of his remarks – which was accurate – was a “pathetic excuse.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Contrary to what the Red State Watcher articles implied, however, the video had nothing to do with that dispute, or with the June 2017 terrorist attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, Paul Golding, leader of the right-wing extremist group Britain First, shot the video in March 2017:
 </p>
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
  <p dir="ltr" lang="en">
   London today! “DONALD TRUMP WE LOVE YOU!”

  The video shows a small group of far-right activists engaged in a counter-protest at a much larger anti-racism

  in London on 18 March, at which demonstrators carried

   signs
  </a>
  saying “Stand up to Trump.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s possible some of those chanting in favor of the US President are from London – Paul Golding himself is from the British capital – but the video does not show a spontaneous assembly of non-aligned Londoners favoring Donald Trump over Sadiq Khan in their dispute, following a 3 June 2017 terrorist attack in the city.
