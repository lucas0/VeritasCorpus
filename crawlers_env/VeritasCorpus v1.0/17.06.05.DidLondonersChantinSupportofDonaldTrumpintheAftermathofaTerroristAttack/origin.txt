  Londoners are fed up [with] Sadiq’s [sic] Khan’s soft stance on terrorism. As British citizens die, Kahn [sic] tells the public “not to be alarm.” [sic] This did not settle well with some citizens.

  Some Londoners took [to] the streets and instead of chanting Khan’s name, they chanted Donald Trump’s.
