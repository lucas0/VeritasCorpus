  Heavy metal legend James Hetfield has announced he is leaving Metallica to start a new career in Nashville. He has been a member of Metallica for over 30 years and has created music with that band that will certainly live on forever. Although fans were shocked, a source connected to the band says it has been in the works for “a long time”.
