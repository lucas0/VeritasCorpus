   new homes
  </a>
  within a few days:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Lynn Boggs’ close friend, Daniel C. Stearns, DVM, died on Jan. 27. Instantly, she faced the task of rehoming Stearns’ 52 Thoroughbreds. Sterns was a longtime fixture in the Thoroughbred racing community, having worked as a track veterinarian before founding the Ohio Thoroughbred Breeders &amp; Owners. He also served as president of Ohio Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protection Association and was an active Thoroughbred breeder at the time of his death.
  </p>
  <p>
   After Stearns’ son dismantled his father’s breeding and racing farm, he gave Boggs and her boyfriend, Jerry Noss, a week to find homes for the 52 horses. He planned to send any unadopted animals to auction. Boggs, who owns 10 racehorses herself, posted a plea for help on her Facebook page, and within 10 minutes she had her first response.
  </p>
  <p>
   The impromptu Facebook campaign was more successful than Lynn Boggs could have imagined — she received more than 4,000 phone calls and hundreds of text messages about the horses. “They were adopted out one here, and one there. A few people took three because they had room. The biggest lot was 11, and that was a personal friend.”
  </p>
  <p>
   She said that she was cautious of adopting out large lots of horses for fear they would end up at auction, which is exactly what she’d set out to avoid.
  </p>
  <p>
   Four days later, on Feb. 1, the last horse left the farm around 10:30 p.m.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Boggs maintained she never claimed the horses were headed for slaughter and said that possibility was added to her social media posts by others who passed them along:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Although Boggs avoided mentioning “slaughter” in her original posting, subsequent posts by other concerned parties mentioned this as a possibility, should the horses not find new homes. “I didn’t want to say slaughter; I hate that word,” she said, noting she didn’t believe they would have that end. She thinks the post gained even more momentum when the word “slaughter” entered the description.

  A version of this message was recirculated in late 2012, apparently as a lure to entice readers into calling a premium-rate phone number based in the UK:
 </p>
 <blockquote>

Calls to the provided phone number subsequently reached a recorded message which said: "Hello this is Lynn. We'd like to thank you.  The horses have all been adopted.  Please do not leave a message as it fills up my voice mail. Thank you and have a great day."
