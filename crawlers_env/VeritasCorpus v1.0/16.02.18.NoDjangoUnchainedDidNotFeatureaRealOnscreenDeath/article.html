  In February 2016, an old rumor claiming that actor
  <span class="itemprop">
   Ato Essandoh had been killed during the filming of
  </span>
  <em>
   Django Unchained
  </em>
  started recirculating on Facebook as the following meme:

  The above-displayed graphic was first shared on the internet shortly after the release of
  <em>
   Django Unchained

  in 2012, referring to the following scene:

  The actor also discussed the death hoax in an
  <a href="http://citybeat.com/cincinnati/article-28174-ato_essandoh_talks_copper_death_hoax_and_tv_obsessions.html" target="_blank">
   interview
  </a>
  with
  <em>
   City Beat
  </em>
  in July 2013:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   (Dealing with the death hoax) was fun because I was just on Twitter and somebody tweeted me that and I just about to dismiss it — I was like oh, that’s so stupid — and then I saw that there were like 500 comments, people who were like, ‘Is this true? Did Leonardo DiCaprio kill this poor boy? Did he sacrifice himself?’ Are you kidding me? So I just started tweeting. Once you get my snark going, I’ll just start snarking it up all over Twitter. So that was one of the best things that’s happened in my career, I guess — people thinking I’m dead!
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Rumors about Ato Essandoh’s death at the hands of Leonardo DiCaprio, Quentin Tarantino, and a dog weren’t true when they first circulated in 2012, and (unsurprisingly) still weren’t true when they came around once again, nearly four years later.
