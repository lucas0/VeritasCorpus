 <p>
  Orientation for volunteers working with Samaritan’s Purse will be at 7:30 in the morning. If you can, please volunteer, either with Samaritan’s Purse or GSBC. We need help with a number of activities and projects that we are managing related to the relief effort.
 </p>
 <p>
  As mentioned this morning, we will have a hot meal ready to go for those who need it between 4pm-5:30pm at the main entrance of the church.
 </p>
 <p>
  I also want to let you know that as a result of his visit to our church and seeing the work that we are doing to help the community, Donald Trump is sending a financial contribution to the church to aid our efforts.
