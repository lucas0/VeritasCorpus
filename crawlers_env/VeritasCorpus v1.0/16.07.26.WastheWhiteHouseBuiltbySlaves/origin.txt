 <p>
  That is the story of this country. The story that has brought me to the stage tonight. The story of generations of people who felt the lash of bondage, the shame of servitude, the sting of segregation, who kept on striving, and hoping, and doing what needed to be done. So that today,
  <strong>
   I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves
  </strong>
  . And I watch my daughters — two beautiful intelligent black young women — play with the dog on the White House lawn.
