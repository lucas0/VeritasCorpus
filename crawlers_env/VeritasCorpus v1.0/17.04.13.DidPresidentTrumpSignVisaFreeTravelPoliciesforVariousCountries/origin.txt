<blockquote>
 <p>
  The United States President, Donald Trump has signed an executive order to allow all Pakistan nationals travel to the United States without visas.
 </p>
 <p>
  The new order, serving as a change in visa policy for Pakistanis traveling to the United States, would permit them stay in the U.S for a maximum period of 180 days for Tourism or Business purposes only. Stay over 180 days would therefore require a visa.
 </p>
 <p>
  Trump says this measure is to strengthen trade between the United States and Pakistan.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Pakistanis who hold dual nationality will be banned from entering the United States if their other passport is from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen — the seven Muslim-majority countries “of concern”.
