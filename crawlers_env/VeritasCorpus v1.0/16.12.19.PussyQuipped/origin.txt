  “The whole concept of making people look foolish in an unsuspecting environment has been happening since ‘Candid Camera,'” said entertainment law attorney Mel Avanzado, who has represented producers on issues related to unscripted TV shows. “‘Borat’ is not new. It’s just taking it to a new level of silliness.”

  Many of those who appear in “Borat” feel they were publicly humiliated, but Avanzado says that, legally speaking, is not sufficient grounds for a lawsuit. “It’s not that you are placed in an embarrassing light,” he said. “You have to be placed in a false light.”
