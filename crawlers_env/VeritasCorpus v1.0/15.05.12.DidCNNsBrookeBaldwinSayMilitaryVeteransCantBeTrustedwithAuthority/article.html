  Baldwin, however, never said this. The quote “Don’t hire veterans, they can’t be trusted with authority” is a very loose paraphrase of a passage from her

  Baldwin’s actual comment about how some veterans might not make good police officers because “some of them are coming back from war [and] they don’t know the communities, and they’re ready to do battle” was rather far from the claim that she had stated “Don’t hire veterans, they can’t be trusted with authority.”  Still, many viewers (and many who didn’t even see the interview) found Baldwin’s words to be offensive. Shortly after the interview aired, Baldwin issued an
