  Hello everybody this is Shomari asking a huge favor on the part of my dearest friends. I need for you to send my cousin Asha Degree’s picture to as many people as you know and to as many States as you can. She has been missing since Monday February 14, 2000 between the hours of 2:30 and 6:30 in the morning. This is tearing my family into pieces and we want to get as many people involved as we can.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nobody knows where she will turn up, so even if you don’t fell like sending it, do it anyway. Because in as in my case, you never care until it happens to you and your family. I would like for those of you who can, to make posters and put them up at your schools, jobs, and local towns if you can.
 </p>
 <p>
  No effort will go unnoticed and everything you can do will be appreciated. Just imagine if one of your family members was missing and you had no clue as to where they were and why they left. Well that’s what my family is going through right now.
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ll appreciate your help and keep us in your prayers that God will see us through this terrible tradgedy. Also please put the Charlotte’s Channel 3 website on there to up awareness of her disappearance. The site is www.wbtv.com. Again thanks for your support and I hope that this all ends in the finding of my nine year old cousin Asha Degree.
 </p>
 <p>
  I love you all, and God bless.
