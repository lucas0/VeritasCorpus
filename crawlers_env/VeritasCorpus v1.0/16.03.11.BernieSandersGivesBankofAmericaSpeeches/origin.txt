  Bernie Sanders, sinking in the democratic primary race and now 1.7 million popular votes behind rival Hillary Clinton, has settled on his last ditch effort at getting back into the game. He’s insinuating that Clinton can’t be trusted and has something to hide because she gave speeches sponsored by Wall Street entities like Goldman Sachs. “Release the transcripts,” he now routinely demands. One little problem: Sanders just gave a speech sponsored by Bank of America and Liberty Mutual. Will he release his transcripts?

  The Bernie Sanders speech took place on Friday, February 5th of this year in New Hampshire. The “Program Sponsors” for the event, which is fancy way of listing the corporate entities that forked over money, includes no less than five of the multibillion dollar corporate entities that Sanders routinely blames for all the nation’s ills while insisting he hasn’t taken any money from.

  The list includes Bank of America, Comcast, Fidelity Investments, Liberty Mutual, and Lincoln Financial Group. It’s a who’s who of the Wall Street entities that Bernie routinely professes to hate.
