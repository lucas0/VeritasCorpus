  A video purportedly showing “Army-style Muslim migrants” marching through a Berlin to show their “willingness to fight” reached a wide audience when it was posted to the Facebook page “Eye On Islam” on 28 November 2016:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   GERMANY: ISLAMICS MARCHING THROUGH BERLIN!
  </p>
  <p>
   Hundreds of Islamics, all dressed close to army attire, marched through Berlin – showing they are huge in numbers and ready to fight.

  , where it was accompanied by a fear-mongering statement claiming that this footage showed a “declaration of war.” However, this video does not show a group of Muslim migrants, nor does it show a military group preparing for war, and it was not taken in Berlin or anywhere else in Germany. It actually shows what has been classified as a German “rocker” group (similar to a motorcycle gang in the United States) called

  This footage has been circulating since at least 12 July 2016, when it was published to YouTube by the “Rocker Blog.” A similar video was published to the “Bahoz Ulm” Facebook page on 10 July 2016, along with the

  itself in a May 2016 Facebook post as an “anti-racist, anti-fascist” group comprised of mainly Kurdish men (although they say that all nationalities and religions are welcome). They also dispute the terms “gang” and “rocker group.” Regardless, the video does not show “army-style Muslim migrants” marching in Berlin.
