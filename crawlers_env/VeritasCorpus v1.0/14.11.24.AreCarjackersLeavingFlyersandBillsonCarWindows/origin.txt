  Imagine: You walk across the parking lot, unlock your car and get inside. Then you lock all your doors, start the engine and shift into REVERSE. Habit! You look into the rear-view window to back out of your parking space and you notice a piece of paper, some sort of advertisement stuck to your rear window. So, you shift into PARK, unlock your doors and jump out of your vehicle to remove that paper (or whatever it is) that is obstructing your
  <nobr>
   view …
  </nobr>
  when you reach the back of your car, that is when the car-jackers jump out of
  <nobr>
   nowhere …
  </nobr>
  jump into your car and take off — your engine was running, your purse is in the car, and they practically mow you down as they speed off in your car.
 </p>
 <p>
  BE AWARE OF THIS NEW SCHEME
 </p>
 <p>
  Just drive away and remove the paper that is stuck to your window
  <nobr>
   later …
  </nobr>
  and be thankful that you read this email and that you forwarded it to your friends.

  Please beware that my daughter was coming out of the West York Wal-Mart tonight and as she was walking to her car she noticed that a couple of guys were watching her, she got into her car and locked her doors. As she was leaving she saw what appeared to be a 100.00 dollar bill on her windshield, she was smart enough not to get out of her car at the time because she remember a email that I sent her not that long ago about people putting something on the windshield and when the person gets out to retrieve it they are car jacked.
