  DNA analysis has been released revealing that
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   Bryshere Y. Gray
  </span>
  also known as Yass the Greatest who plays Hakeem Lyon on the hit show Empire is actually the biological son of rap mogul
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   Jay-Z.
  </span>
  This doesn’t come as too much of a shock as the rapper’s dalliances are well accounted for, but it does ask the question of whether or not Bryshere will inherit “The Rock” from his estranged father.

  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   Jay-Z

  proudly confirmed that he is in fact his father in an interview by saying:
 </p>
 <p>
  “Yea that’s Blue Ivy’s big brother can’t you tell that’s my genes that gave him his skills. I’m proud of my son I might sign him to Roc Nation if it makes sense.”
 </p>

  Byshere’s mother “Donut” Shannon Bryshere was one of
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   Jay-Z’s
  </span>
  “ghetto flowers” back in the day when he was selling drugs to help support his musical career. The two distanced themselves from one another after Donut took the fall for a drug charge to keep

  from going to prison.
