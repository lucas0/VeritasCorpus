  Xi Ping Chow, a 57-year-old Chinese immigrant, has been arrested by the NYPD this week after authorities were informed that the man was making his own hot dogs with the meat of stray dogs in the area.

 <p>
  NYC food inspectors were anonymously tipped on Chowâ€™s operation which possibly involved recuperating dead dogs in dumpsters of the Animal Care Centers all over the city, report officials.
