  Representatives from the U.S Food and Drug Administration Center for Tobacco Products have announced a July 2016 ban on the liquid mixture used in vapor products such as electronic cigarettes.

  The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) passed regulations throughout early 2015 requiring manufactures of electronic cigarettes to retroactively submit marketing applications for their products. This was perceived to be a huge blow to the electronic cigarette industry as the fees accrued by manufactures submitting these applications were projected in the millions. The FDA provided impacted companies two years to submit their applications and allowed for them to continue selling the products under review during this two-year window.
