 <p>
  <strong>
   Do not get on board an overloaded or damaged boat.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Make sure that the wooden or rubber hull is in good condition. No holes, torn or deflated parts! If the boat is in poor condition, your life is at immediate risk!
 </p>
 <p>
  We are well aware that relations with smugglers may make these security requirements impossible. But some people have refused to go onboard a boat in poor condition or/and overloaded, since this puts their life at immediate risk.
 </p>
 <p>
  On average, a ten metre long boat cannot take more than 10 people on board. This number goes up to 30 people for a 20 metre long boat. An overloaded boat is exposed to the risk of sinking!
 </p>
 <p>
  Make sure there is enough fuel for the double length of the planned trip!
 </p>
 <p>
  Make sure that there are enough paddles, that they are in good condition, and that the people who hold the paddles have a good experience and are strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Precautions during the trip
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Observe carefully and try to document (by writing it down, for example) everything that happens or that you see during the trip. Any information about places and times can be useful in case of emergency. Take notes, pictures and GPS coordinates if possible. Watch out around you for rocks or other boats that could cause collisions!
 </p>
 <p>
  Protect yourself from the cold, and try to keep your clothes as dry as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Don’t move around the boat so as to keep the balance at all times!
 </p>
 <p>
  Keep a calm attitude and avoid conflicts at any cost! Help each other and protect each other’s lives. In the past years, solidarity amongst the people on board has saved many lives!
 </p>
 <p>
  Hold on firmly to the boat. Any abrupt movement or any panic reaction can put yourself at risk as people can easily fall off the boat, and the boat itself can capsize! There have been several cases in which women and children have died as they were trapped in the cabin underdeck. At the same time, sometimes, especially with bad weather, it is also dangerous to be outside. So if you are in the cabin, be alert to what is happening outside and make sure you can easily get out of it.
