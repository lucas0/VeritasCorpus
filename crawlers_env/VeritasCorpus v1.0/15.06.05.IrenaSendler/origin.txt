 <p>
  There recently was a death of a 98 year old lady named Irena.
 </p>
 <p>
  During WWII, Iliana, got permission to work in the Warsaw Ghetto.
 </p>
 <p>
  She had an ulterior motive…
 </p>
 <p>
  She KNEW what the Nazi’s plans were for the Jews.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iliana smuggled infants out in the bottom of her tool box she carried, and she carried in the back of her truck a Burlap sack, (for larger kids).
 </p>
 <p>
  She also had a dog in the back, that she trained to bark when the Nazi soldiers let her in, and out of the ghetto.
 </p>
 <p>
  The soldiers of course wanted nothing to do with the dog, and the barking covered the kids/infants noises.
 </p>
 <p>
  During her time and course of doing this, she managed to smuggle out and save 2500 kids/infants.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was caught, and the Nazi’s broke both her legs, and arms, and beat her severely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iliana kept a record of the names of all the kids she smuggled out, and kept them in a glass jar, buried under a tree in her back yard.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the war, she tried to locate any parents that may have survived it, and reunited the family.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of course had been gassed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those kids she helped got placed into foster family homes, or adopted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Last year Iliana was up for the Nobel Peace Prize….
 </p>
 <p>
  She LOST.
 </p>
 <p>
  Al Gore won, for a slide show on Global Warming.
