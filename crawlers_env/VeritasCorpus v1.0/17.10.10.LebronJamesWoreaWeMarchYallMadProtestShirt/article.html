 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Cleveland Cavaliers stars LeBron James and Kyrie Irving wore T-shirts with “I Can’t Breathe” on them while warming up for Monday night’s game at the Brooklyn Nets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Nets’ Jarrett Jack, Alan Anderson, Deron Williams and Kevin Garnett also wore the T-shirts.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I can’t breathe” were the last words of Eric Garner, who died in July after a confrontation with an New York Police Department officer. The incident was caught on tape and sparked national outrage.

  that he wore the shirt because he wanted to make a statement about the current state of society and show support for Eric Garner’s family:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “It’s just for us to make a [statement] to understand what we’re going through as a society,” James said when asked about the T-shirt. “I’ve been quoted over and over about what’s going on as far as it’s more of a notion to the family, more than anything. Obviously, as a society we have to do better. We have to be better for one another. It doesn’t matter what race you are. It’s more of a shout out to the family more than anything, because they’re the ones that should be getting all the energy and effort.”
