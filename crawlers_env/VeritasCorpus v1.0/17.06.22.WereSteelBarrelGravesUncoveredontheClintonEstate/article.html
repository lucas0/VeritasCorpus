  On 21 June 2017, the “satirical” web site
  <a href="http://archive.is/9UFoG" target="_blank">
   Freedom Crossroads
  </a>
  reported that 12 barrels containing human remains had been found on property owned by Bill and Hillary Clinton in upstate New York.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   After the body parts of three women were found last night in a barrel unearthed from the garden area of the Clinton Estate in upstate New York, ground penetrating radar was brought in to analyze the entire property. Within a few hours, eleven more possible sites were pinpointed and excavation began.
  </p>
  <p>
   By dawn, 11 more identical steel 55-gallon drums were awaiting transport to Quantico with an immaculate chain of evidence. They will arrive and be opened later today.

 <p>
  The article, like everything published by Freedom Crossroads, is entirely fabricated. Buried at the bottom of its homepage, the
  <a href="http://archive.is/mP9Tb" target="_blank">
   web site
  </a>
  includes a disclaimer:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   We believe that there is nothing more precious than the mind of an aging conservative. Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate. Reality is often in the eye of the beholder. You won’t find any of it here.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  This didn’t prevent the
  <a href="http://archive.is/XWLqa" target="_blank">
   World Truth
  </a>
  web site from republishing the story in earnest, along with the same photo of a
  <a href="http://agc.unlv.edu/egts/EGTS%20Pics/index.html" target="_blank">
   barrel
  </a>
  , which actually originates with a project undertaken by the Applied Geophysics Center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the same day, similar versions of the fake story were also published by the
  <a href="http://archive.is/4cJuk" target="_blank">
   News Feed Hunter
  </a>
  web site (which added invented details such as the names of victims) and the
  <a href="http://archive.is/y3mW9" target="_blank">
   Red Politics
  </a>
  web site, which claimed three of the bodies found were those of three young women who disappeared while hitchhiking in 1974.
 </p>
 <p>
  On its
  <a href="http://archive.is/2Rlph" target="_blank">
   web site
  </a>
  , Red Politics warns readers:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Sometimes the articles are satires and fake and we cannot make any warranties about the completeness, reliability and accuracy of this information.

 <p>
  The June 2017 “buried barrels” story is the latest distasteful chapter in a
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/clintons/bodycount.asp">
   long saga
  </a>
  of deaths and disappearances falsely attributed to or associated with the Clintons over the past few decades.
