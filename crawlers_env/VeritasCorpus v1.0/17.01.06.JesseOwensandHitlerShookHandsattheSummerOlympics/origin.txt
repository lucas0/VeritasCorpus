  When the music ended, (Owens) was led by an Olympic official from the field into the grandstand, and it seemed for a moment that, unlike Cornelius Johnson, he might be introduced to the Fuhrer. “There was considerable excitement in the press box when it looked as though local Jim Crow rules might be off to honor Owens’ victory,” Gallico wrote, “and in charge of an official, he was steered towards the box of Chancellor Hitler in which was also seated Herr Streicher, Germany’s number one hater.” The writers stood up from their seats to get a better view of the meeting that they thought was about to take place. “However,” Gallico wrote, minutes after sitting back down at his typewriter, “Owens was merely led below the honor box where he smiled and bowed and Herr Hitler gave him a friendly little Nazi salute; the sitting down one with the arm bent.”

  This was the moment Owens would later recall, then choose not to recall – the birth of the myth of Hitler’s snub.
