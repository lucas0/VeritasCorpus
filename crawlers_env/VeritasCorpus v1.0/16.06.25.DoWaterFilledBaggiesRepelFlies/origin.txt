  Q: At a Mississippi drive-in, I questioned the waitress about the bag of water over the door, thinking it might be a prank. I am 51 and had never come across this so I thought she was kidding when she told me it repelled flies.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was familiar with its use last summer and was convinced that it is a valid theory. I was motivated to look it up on the Internet. What can you tell me about it?
 </p>
 <p>
  A: This is a result of a column I wrote a number of years ago and is worth repeating.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fill a sandwich-size Ziploc bag about half full of water. Tape the top of the bag to the outside of your door. Replenish the water as needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is not clear why these water bags repel flies, but they do. I have gotten a ton of mail from all over the world when this column originally ran and the mail ran 9 to 1 saying this method worked.
 </p>
 <p>
  You may also get some questions from visitors as to why you have a Ziploc bag of water on your front door.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some possible answers are: It attracts flies. It scares flies. If it freezes, we know it’s cold outside. If it boils, we know it is hot outside. I don’t know, ask the Bug Man, it was his idea.
 </p>
 <p>
  When you drive around town, look for Ziploc bags on doors and you will know who reads this column.
