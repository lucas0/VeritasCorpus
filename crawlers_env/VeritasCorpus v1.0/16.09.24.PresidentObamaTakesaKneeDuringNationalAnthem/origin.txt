  Obama, who previously expressed his support for Kaepernick’s protest, lowered himself to one knee and crossed his arms Sunday morning, as pop singer Beyoncé sang the National Anthem dressed in a “Black Panther” outfit almost identical to the one she wore controversially at the Super Bowl earlier this year. When the Star Spangled Banner was finished, Obama threw his right fist into the air and lowered his head for approximately twenty seconds, before standing and delivering his keynote speech.
