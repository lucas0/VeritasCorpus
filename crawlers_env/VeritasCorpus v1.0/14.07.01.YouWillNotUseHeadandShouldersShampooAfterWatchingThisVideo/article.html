  In June 2014 Facebook users began seeing posts pointing to a purported video clip entitled “You Will Not Use
  <nobr>
   Head &amp; Shoulders
  </nobr>
  Shampoo After Watching This Video,” which supposedly graphically illustrated the deleterious effects of using that popular  brand of shampoo.  (Later versions substituted Dove brand shampoo for
  <nobr>
   Head &amp; Shoulders
  </nobr>
  .)  The static image accompanying the posts was the one displayed above, which allegedly pictures some form of bizarre injury or infection that befall a user of that brand of shampoo.
 </p>
 <p>
  The image itself is a hoax, a fabrication that imitates a notorious fake photograph of a supposed ‘

  caused by South American larvae’ (created by merging a picture of a
  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&amp;hl=en&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=775&amp;q=%22lotus+seed+pod%22&amp;oq=%22lotus+seed+pod%22&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l10.703.4614.0.4750.22.19.3.0.0.0.151.1526.15j4.19.0....0...1ac.1.48.img..1.21.1469.ciT7t23HS88" target="_blank">

  The referenced video does not exist, and the purpose of the hoax was to serve as a lure in leading users to yet another survey scam: those who clicked through on the teaser link hoping to view the
  <nobr>
   Head &amp; Shoulders
  </nobr>
  video were instead taken to a screen that forced them to first share the link with others on Facebook and/or verify their age by completing a
  <a href="http://www.surveysandpromotions.com/Flow.aspx" target="_blank">
   survey
  </a>
  that promised a $100 VISA Gift Card for its completion:

  </center>
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, getting that “free” $100 gift card required — as explained in tiny type at the bottom of the survey page — that participants first sign up for several different offers, each of which required them to purchase something, subscribe to something, or apply (and be accepted for) a credit card or loan:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Purchase Requirements. Incentives are split into two tiers:
   <nobr>
    Tier 1
   </nobr>
   incentives with a value of $100 or less and
   <nobr>
    Tier 2
   </nobr>
   incentives with a value more than $100. To qualify for a
   <nobr>
    Tier 1
   </nobr>
   incentive you must complete
   <nobr>
    2 Silver,
   </nobr>
   <nobr>
    2 Gold
   </nobr>
   and
   <nobr>
    1 Platinum
   </nobr>
   offer. To qualify for a
   <nobr>
    Tier 2
   </nobr>
   incentive, you must complete

   and
   <nobr>
    6 Platinum
   </nobr>
   offers. You must complete all offers within 30 days from when you complete your first offer. Completion of offers usually requires a purchase, subscription or filing a credit application and being accepted for a financial product such as a credit card or consumer loan.
