   New Hacker warning on FB messenger but did not see it here when I checked for validity. I usually shit these down with a link from Snopes. But there is nothing so here is what I received:
   <br/>
   Please tell all the contacts in your messenger list not to accept anything from Fabrizio Brambilla. He has a foto with a dog. He is a hacker and has the system connected to your messanger account. If one of your contacts accepts it, you will also be hacked, so make sure that all your friends know it. Thanks. Forwarded as received.

  The examples reproduced above are multiple variants of a long-running
  <a href="/computer/internet/dontadd.asp" target="dontadd">
   hoax
  </a>
  , one which warns readers not to allow contact from a particular person or group because dire consequences will result. The basic form of these hoax warnings is typically drawn from the following template:
 </p>
 <ul type="DISC">
  <li>
   Do not {read / open / respond to / join}
  </li>
  <li>
   an {e-mail / text message / friend request / }
  </li>
  <li>
   sent by {real name / e-mail address / screen name}!
  </li>
  <li>
   If you do, {you / your computer / your Facebook account / everyone on your contact list / your children}
  </li>
  <li>
   will be in danger of falling victim to a {serial killer / computer virus / hacker / predator}.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <!--
<FONT FACE="" class="quote_font" SIZE=2>

<DIV STYLE="" class="quote_style">
Do not {read/open/respond to/join} an {e-mail | instant message | invitation | Facebook group} sent by {real name | e-mail address | IM screen name}! If you do, {you | your computer | everyone on your contact list | your children} will be in danger of falling victim to a {serial killer | computer virus | hacker | predator}.
</DIV></FONT>
-->
 </p>
 <p>
  Variants of these messages are circulated endlessly, with different names swapped in and out as various pranksters decide to play jokes on people they know by inserting their acquaintances’ names and addresses into the warning in place of the existing information.
 </p>
 <p>
  The most common variant of this hoax is one that warns the reader not to accept Facebook friend requests from “hackers” purportedly named “Christopher Davies” and “Jessica Davies,” otherwise one of the two will wreak some unspecified havoc by being able to “FIGURE OUT UR COMPUTER’S ID AND ADDRESS.” (The latest version also incorporates a hoax warning about the non-existent “
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/computer/virus/popedance.asp" target="dp">
   Dance of the Pope
  </a>
  ” cell phone virus.)
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, it’s not outside the realm of possibility that an e-mail message or a link posted on Facebook might carry a virus payload which could infect your computer and allow it be controlled by a
  <a href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid14_gci1030284,00.html#" target="_blank">
   botnet
  </a>
  , but virus warnings that correspond to the patterns detailed above can be safely dismissed as japes.
 </p>
 <p>
  In March 2009, the “Simon Ashton” variant of this prank was combined with text referencing the hoax version of the
  <a href="/computer/virus/mailserver.asp" target="mail">
   Mail Server Report
  </a>
  virus warning:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Anyone-using Internet mail such as Yahoo, Hotmail, AOL and so on. This information arrived this morning, Direct from both Microsoft and Norton. Please send it to everybody you know who has access to the Internet. You may receive an apparently harmless e-mail titled ‘Mail Server Report’
  </p>
  <p>
   If you open either file, a message will appear on your screen saying: ‘It is too late now, your life is no longer beautiful.’
  </p>
  <p>
   Subsequently you will LOSE EVERYTHING IN YOUR PC, And the person who sent it to you will gain access to your name, e-mail and password.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is a new virus which started to circulate on Saturday afternoon. AOL has already confirmed the severity, and the anti virus software’s are not capable of destroying it.
  </p>
  <p>
   The virus has been created by a hacker who calls himself ‘life owner’.
  </p>
  <p>
   PLEASE SEND A COPY OF THIS E-MAIL TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS, And ask them to PASS IT ON IMMEDIATELY!
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  In June 2017, a new variant of the same hoax emerged, with Anwar Jitou (or Anwar Jitu) taking the role of boogeyman on this occasion. The hoax was particularly prevalent among Italian Facebook users, where the warning message typically read like this:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Si prega di dire a tutti i contatti della tua lista Messenger, di non accettare il contatto di Anwar Jitou [Anwar Jitu], è un hacker che ha il computer collegato nel tuo account Facebook. Se uno dei tuoi contatti lo accetta, sarai anche hackerato, così fai in modo, che tutti i tuoi amici lo sappiano.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  It subsequently spread to the English-speaking internet, where Facebook users were told:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Please tell all the contacts in your Messenger list not to accept Anwar Jitou’s [Anwar Jitu’s] contact, it’s a hacker that has the computer connected to your Facebook account. If one of your contacts accepts it, you will also be hacked, so make sure that all your friends know it.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Additional and very popular identical hoaxes in 2017 included the purported hackers Fabrizio Brambilla
  <!-- Fabrizio Brambillo, Fabrizio Bambilla, Fabrizio Bambrilla, Fabrizio Brambrilla -->
  and Jayden K. Smith … new names, same old hoax.
  <!--
A March 2010 variant of this hoax targeted users of Facebook's popular <A HREF="http://farmvillefeed.com/wp/" TARGET=farm target="_blank">FarmVille</A>  FarmVille application:

The new 3 Egg virus that is making its way across Facebook is 100% NOT TRUE. The Rumor itself is more viral than the supposed "Virus". The gentleman who they are speaking of is just a ordinary player who reworked OLD links and made them work for the new spring gifts. This poor guy doesn't even know what's going on, yet everyone is talking about him.

Here is what is being passed around:

<I>RED ALERT!!! Norton has just informed me that the post for Send the 3 spring Eggs at a time is a virus, Rawand Bradosty is a HACKER from Pakistan, do not click on this post it is not legitimate, please copy and repost immediately!"</I>
