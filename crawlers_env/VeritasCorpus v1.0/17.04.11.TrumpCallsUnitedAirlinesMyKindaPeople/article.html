  On 11 April 2017, the entertainment web site
  <em>
   News Thump
  </em>
  published a satirical
  <a href="http://newsthump.com/2017/04/11/donald-trump-calls-united-airlines-my-kinda-people-after-they-forcibly-dragged-foreign-looking-man-off-plane/" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  reporting that President Trump voiced support for United Airlines after a
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2017/04/10/passenger-force-united-flight/" target="_blank">
   video
  </a>
  surfaced showing a passenger being forcibly removed from a flight:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   President Trump has been quick to herald United Airlines staff and security as ‘my kind of people’ after footage emerged online of an elderly foreign-looking doctor being violently thrown off a plane.
  </p>
  <p>
   […]
  </p>
  <p>
   President Trump addressed White House press shortly afterwards saying, “Listen people, what United Airlines did today was great, just great. These are the kind of things that will help make America great again, bigly.
  </p>
  <p>
   “They told this guy to volunteer to give up his seat, and he refused. Sad! So un-American.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  This is not a genuine quote from President Trump.

   This is not a real tweet from Trump; the tweet was posted as a screenshot, which can be easily manipulated, with no link to an original tweet. It does not appear in Trump’s
   <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump" target="_blank">
    Twitter
   </a>
   timeline, or in any genuine news reports. Nor does it appear on the page where
   <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/user/realDonaldTrump?page=1&amp;per_page=50" target="_blank">
    ProPublica
