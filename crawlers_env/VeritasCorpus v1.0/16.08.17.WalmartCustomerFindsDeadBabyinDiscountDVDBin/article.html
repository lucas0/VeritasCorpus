  published a disturbing account of the purported discovery of a deceased and discarded newborn baby girl in a “discount DVD bin” at a Kentucky Walmart:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   42-year old Diane Jessop received the surprise of her life while shopping at her local Roy County, Kentucky, Walmart Saturday morning. According to police statements, Mrs. Jessop was sorting through the store’s discount DVD bin in attempt to find a few movies to give her granddaughter on her upcoming birthday when she discovered a lifeless newborn buried in the middle of the bin.

   According to on-scene witnesses, several customers made their way to the DVD bin when they heard Mrs. Jessop scream and call for help. Jessop told police that as she was sorting through the DVD’s she saw what appeared to be a small foot. The bin was in close proximity to the store’s toy isle so Mrs. Jessop initially assumed that someone had placed a doll in the bin. It wasn’t until she grabbed the foot and pulled the body from the pile of DVD’s that she realized that it was not a baby doll, but the body of a lifeless newborn girl.

   Local police and responding paramedics confirmed that the child had been dead for approximately 48-hours and was estimated to be around 2-months old.

  If it seemed unlikely a legitimate news outlet would describe such a tragic and gruesome discovery as the “surprise of [someone’s] life,” that’s because the claim was one of many hoax articles published by
