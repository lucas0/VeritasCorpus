  Recently an image purportedly showing a new sign installed on the side of a road in Thailand appeared to warn residents about roaming billionaires (along with seemingly mocking symbol of an obese hunter) was

  The “Beware of Billionaire” sign above is a digital creation.
 </p>
 <p>
  One would expect for government installed signs in Thailand to have similar design qualities. However, the words “Beware of Billionaire” on this sign are written in a different sized font than the “Beware of Elephants” sign.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fake sign also has rounded edges, where as the “elephants” signs edges are squared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lastly, you can see the markings where the “elephants” sign was installed to the pole. The “Beware of Billionaire” sign, on the other hand, has no such markings:

   We attempted to track down “Mao@MuakLek” but couldn’t locate the apparent image creator. In fact, it appears that this watermark may have been the result of a mistranslation: Muak Lek is a province in Thailand and a Twitter posting credited this image to “Cr.คุณ mao@muaklek” (translated to Khun Mao @ Muaklek). It seems that this image was taken in Muak Lek rather than by MuakLek.

 <p>
  Regardless of who was responsible for creating this image, the “Beware of Billionaire” sign is fake.

  <em>
   The Washington Post

  reported:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The head of one of Thailand’s largest construction companies has been arrested for hunting protected animals in a wildlife sanctuary and was found with the skin of a black panther and other animals, officials announced Tuesday.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thailand’s Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation said Premchai Karnasuta was arrested Sunday with three others after park officials were informed they had set up camp in a restricted wildlife sanctuary on Thailand’s western border. The Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary is listed as a World Heritage Site by the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO because of its diversity of fauna and flora.
