  The video clip embedded above supposedly represents evidence
  <nobr>
   (“Exhibit B-5”)
  </nobr>
  presented in the 2009 civil court case of
  <em>
   Gilland vs. Sheri Lume
  </em>
  concerning the death of a girl who was supposedly run down by a car after frantically  fleeing her home from a man that she thought was a masked intruder (but who was really a neighbor playing a prank on her).
 </p>
 <p>
  However, this video is a bit of creative fiction which features a deliberately crafted scenario performed by actors and enhanced through the use of special effects.  “Rachel,” the putative victim in this clip, was portrayed by actress

   Cindy Vela
  </a>
  , and the
  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/yKjsUL-escE" target="_blank">
   longer version
  </a>
  of this video also features actress
  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1597260/" target="_blank">
   Mircea Monroe
  </a>
  as “Sheri,” the roommate who punks her, and actor
  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005269/" target="_blank">
   Corin Nemec
  </a>
  as the neighbor who terrifies her by pretending to be a home intruder.

  Cindy Vela’s web site biography notes that:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Cindy created controversy with an internet video called ‘Exhibit B-5’ aka ‘Girl Dies’ directed by Project Greenlight winner Kyle Rankin which had millions searching for answers to her life and identity.

  page also references this video and describes it thusly:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   This is a short film entitled EXHIBIT B-5. It’s meant for entertainment purposes only. Credits include:
  </p>
  <p>
   Written &amp; Directed: Kyle Rankin.
   <br>
    Digital FX: R. Zane.
    <br/>
    Rachel (girl who dies): me/Cindy Vela.
    <br/>
    Sheri (blonde/roommate): Mircea Monroe.
    <br/>
    Neighbor (guy who scares me/neighbor): Corin Nemec.
   </br>
  </p>
  <p>
   No mannequins were used and I can’t say exactly how we did it, but I did have to lay on top of and underneath the car. I have to applaud the special effects — the first time I saw it I was shocked. This was NOT a reenactment of a real story, Not an advertisement and Not for marketing of another film.
