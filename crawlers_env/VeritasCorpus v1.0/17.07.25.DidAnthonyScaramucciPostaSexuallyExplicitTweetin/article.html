  In July 2017, several news outlets reported that Anthony Scaramucci had

   deleted

  several old tweets after he was hired as U.S. President Donald Trump’s new White House communications director. As reports filed in, and tweets disappeared, an image purportedly showing a sexually explicit tweet Scaramucci had posted several years before suddenly appeared, along with an oddly insistent description:

  The message shown in this tweet really did appear on 9 July 2009, but (probably predictably) it was not sent by Anthony Scaramucci. It was actually posted by director Kevin Smith, and it is still available on his

  Both messages show the same timestamp, indicating that whomever created the fake Scaramucci message simply cut out Smith’s Twitter name and replaced it

  ) have documented the various tweets Scaramucci deleted in July 2017.
 </p>
 <p>
  Scaramucci said that he was deleting old tweets, many of which criticized President Donald Trump, because he didn’t want his “past views” to serve as a distraction:
 </p>
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
  <p dir="ltr" lang="en">
   Full transparency: I’m deleting old tweets. Past views evolved &amp; shouldn’t be a distraction. I serve

  Although the tweet may have been embarrassing to Scaramucci if it had been real, it is of a personal nature and therefore would not have conflicted in any way with his position.
