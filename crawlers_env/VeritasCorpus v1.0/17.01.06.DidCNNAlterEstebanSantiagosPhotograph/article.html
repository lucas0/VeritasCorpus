  On 6 January 2017, just a few hours after multiple people were
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2017/01/06/several-shot-at-fort-lauderdale-airport/" target="_blank">
   killed
  </a>
  by a gunman at Florida’s Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood airport, disreputable web site

  <a href="http://archive.is/vkdqN#selection-519.0-525.60" target="_blank">
   published

  an article claiming that CNN altered a photograph of Esteban Santiago, the alleged shooter, to make his skin appear lighter:

   Here is a photo of shooter Esteban Santiago.

   And here is what CNN aired.

   It appears CNN doctored the photo to make the suspect look more white.

    Sad.

  CNN has published several
  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/06/us/fort-lauderdale-airport-incident/index.html" target="_blank">
   videos
  </a>
  about the incident, yet we found no record of either photograph airing on the network. We have also seen no credible reports that this aired live on television.  A report from the
  <em>
   Daily Beast
  </em>
  also
  <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/01/06/inside-the-alt-right-s-florida-airport-shooter-esteban-santiago-hoax.html" target="_blank">
   found
  </a>
  that these images never appeared on CNN.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, the man pictured in this photograph is not the same Esteban Santiago connected to the Florida shooting, but rather a different man with the same name who was
  <a href="http://www.sexoffenderrecord.com/offender/view/572239" target="_blank">
   registered
  </a>
  as a sex offender in Florida.  CBS News published photographs of the actual accused shooter, which clearly showed a different (and much younger) man, who is also named Esteban Santiago:

  We were also unable to find any evidence that CBS (or anyone else) had lightened the actual suspect’s skin in the photograph displayed here.
