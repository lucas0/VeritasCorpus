  On 29 April 2016, the web site

  published an
  <a href="http://archive.is/A4Mbk" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  reporting that Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons would stop selling pork items at the behest of Muslim customers:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Tim Hortons has made a shocking announcement and has removed ham and bacon from almost 4,600 locations, and switched to halal meat alternatives in an attempt to please its Muslim customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   It has confirmed turkey ham and turkey rashers will be used instead in 3,500 of its stores, where all the meat will now be prepared according to halal rules.
  </p>
  <p>
   The chain, which has around 4,600 outlets across the Canada and US, explained its decision by saying it had to balance animal welfare concerns with ‘the views of religious communities’.
  </p>
  <p>
   This has not been confirmed by any news outlets yet as to protect it’s customers.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Later, the following was tacked on to the end of the article:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   DISCLAIMER: This article was submitted an unknown and anonymous source therefore we cannot confirm it’s credibility and will label it as satire as we cannot confirm the source.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  No such news had been announced by any Tim Hortons restaurants, either in the U.S. or Canada. The chain’s site featured a menu on which pork products appeared among
  <a href="http://www.timhortons.com/ca/en/menu/breakfast.php" target="_blank">
   breakfast
  </a>
  and
  <a href="http://www.timhortons.com/ca/en/menu/sandwiches-and-bowls.php" target="_blank">
   lunch
  </a>
  options. Given that even the source of the claim finally labeled the story “satire,” it is clear that no such announcement (either furtively or openly) was made by the chain.
