  During his 2018 State of the Union address, as Donald Trump talked about monuments — to freedom, to historical figures, and to veterans — Republicans started chanting “USA!” As they did so, about three minutes before the end of the speech, Democratic Congressman Luis Gutiérrez gathered up his things and walked out of the room — a move that has put him at the center of a storm of outrage.

  , in a piece headlined “Democrat Luis Gutiérrez Storms Out of State of the Union During ‘USA’ Chant” said:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Rep. Luis Gutiérrez turned and left the State of the Union address Tuesday, just as Republicans broke into a “USA” chant. President Donald Trump had just finished mentioning the Statue of Freedom atop the Capitol building, which he then called a “monument to the American people.”
  </p>
  <p>
   In that section of remarks, Trump also praised veterans in wars from the Revolution, through World War II and today, mentioning sites like Saratoga, N.Y., Yorktown, V.A. and the Pacific theater.
  </p>
  <p>
   As half of the gallery broke into a “USA” chant, Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) could be seen exiting his aisle seat and walking out of the chamber.

  </a>
  Gutiérrez left because he was “triggered” by the chanting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Speaking to Fox News, Deputy White House Press Secretary J. Hogan Gidley responded to the Congressman’s early departure from the speech, saying “For the life of me I can’t figure out when Democrats became so…anti-this country.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In reality, Gutiérrez has dismissed these claims, saying he left the chamber in order to make it to a television interview on time, adding that he deliberately waited until the president had stopped speaking before leaving his seat.

   There is a story going around that I “stormed out” of the President’s speech last night which is completely false. That I boycotted the speech or protested by leaving during an applause break is just someone’s spin.

   I was due on TV for an interview and the speech was running late. I waited until the President stopped talking and walked to the back and watched the last 90-seconds on TV (after sitting for 80 minutes). Then went to my interview. Those are the facts.
