  New First Lady Melania Trump’s
  <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/first-lady-melania-trump" target="_blank">
   biography
  </a>
  on the official White House website briefly highlighted not just her early life, but her business ventures.
 </p>
 <p>
  The page initially made note of a jewelry line she promoted via the QVC shopping network:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Melania is also a successful entrepreneur. In April 2010, Melania Trump launched her own jewelry collection, “Melania™ Timepieces &amp; Jewelry”, on QVC.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  However, a search for the collection on the network’s website
  <a href="http://www.qvc.com/CatalogSearch?langId=-1&amp;storeId=10251&amp;catalogId=10151&amp;keyword=melania" target="_blank">
   produces
  </a>
  no results.
 </p>
 <p>
  A network spokesperson
  <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/01/20/white-house-website-promotes-melania-trumps-modeling-and-jewelry-line/" target="_blank">
   confirmed
  </a>
  to the
  <em>
   Washington Post
  </em>
  that the line has been discontinued:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   At QVC, we pride ourselves on curating an ever-changing mix of products from thousands of brands for our customers to discover. As part of this, QVC has offered items from Melania Trump’s brand. At this time, QVC does not have an active relationship with the brand.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  However, the statement regarding the jewelry lines had been removed from the page as of 23 January 2017.

 <p>

  <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/press-release/trump-now-violating-constitution/" target="_blank">
