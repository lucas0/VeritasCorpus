  On 27 September 2016, social media users began sharing a claim that Republican nominee Donald Trump had threatened to skip the remaining presidential debates if Hillary Clinton attended was published as part of
  <em>
   The New Yorker
  </em>
  ‘s “Borowitz Report”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Plunging the future of the 2016 Presidential debates into doubt, Donald J. Trump said on Tuesday morning that he would not participate in the remaining two debates if Hillary Clinton is there.
