  A friend of a friend was caught red-handed with another woman by his long-time partner, and came home the next evening to find that she had flown the nest. Within days, the heartless brute had invited his new lady to share the flat. But, after a few weeks, a strange smell appeared to have taken over the bedroom.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter what the bloke tried — a bucketful of scent, disinfectant, joss sticks, even changing his socks — the nostril-assailing niff worsened by the week.
 </p>
 <p>
  Over the summer months, the noxious brume had graduated from a honk to an almighty hum, and very fishy it was too.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, it got so bad the anguished couple decided they had to move out. The stench meant they had to sell the flat well below market value, but they were happy just to be leaving their pongy past behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as the removal van was being packed, the former cohabitee — who had got wind they were moving out — drew up in her car.
 </p>
 <p>
  Apparently, she was responsible for the noxious odours. She’d secretly emptied an economy pack of prawns into the hollow curtain poles in the bedroom as a devious revenge for her treatment.
 </p>
 <p>
  As if making the new couple move house wasn’t vengeance enough, the cuckold could hardly contain her glee when she spotted the removal men lugging the brass curtain poles into the van bound for the brand new apartment.

  Back in 1992, a friend of my fiance had a major disagreement with her boyfriend, so decided to get back at him. He had bought himself a new car (around $30,000 worth), which was typically his pride and joy. She had two other friends remove the passenger seat from the car, and then she cut open the lining along the edge and inserted a fresh fish, then neatly restitched along the seam.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was fine for the first few days … until the flesh started to rot.
 </p>
 <p>
  The boyfriend vacuumed, deodorised, pulled out the seats washed everything down … but didn’t find the fish.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the two split up he had no luck picking up a new bird because no woman would set foot in the car.
 </p>
 <p>
  He finally gave up and sold the car: losing around $12,000 to $15,000 of its actual worth because of the horrible smell.
