  This is 92-year-old Pam Nelson from Victoria, Texas.
 </p>
 <p>
  She’s voted in every election she’s ever been eligible for. Due to Texas’ new “voter ID law” she WASN’T able to vote in last month’s primary.
 </p>
 <p>
  She tried several times to get an ID but couldn’t wait the hours in line required. She tried to get an ID by mail, but you can’t do that if you’re over 70.
 </p>
 <p>
  Share if you agree “voter ID” laws are voter suppression!
