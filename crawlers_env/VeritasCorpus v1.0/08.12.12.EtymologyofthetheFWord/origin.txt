  <i>
   fokken
  </i>
  = “to thrust, copulate with”; Norwegian dialect
  <i>
   fukka
  </i>
  = “to copulate”; and Swedish dialect
  <i>
   focka
  </i>
  = “to strike, push, copulate” and
  <i>
   fock
  </i>
  = “penis”. Although German
  <i>
   ficken
  </i>
  may enter the picture somehow, it is problematic in having e-grade, or umlaut, where all the others have o-grade or zero-grade of the vowel.

  AHD1, following Pokorny, derived “feud”, “fey”, “fickle”, “foe”, and “fuck” from an Indo-European root

  = “hostile”; but AHD2 and AHD3 have dropped this connection for “fuck” and give no pre-Germanic etymon for it. Eric Partridge, in the 7th edition of

  = “to prick” (which is the source of the English words “compunction”, “expunge”, “impugn”, “poignant”, “point”, “pounce”, “pugilist”, “punctuate”, “puncture”, “pungent”, and “pygmy”). Robert Claiborne, in

  (Times, 1989) agrees that this is “probably” the etymon. Problems with such theories include a distribution that suggests a North-Sea Germanic areal form rather than an inherited one; the murkiness of the phonetic relations; and the fact that no alleged cognate outside Germanic has sexual connotations.
