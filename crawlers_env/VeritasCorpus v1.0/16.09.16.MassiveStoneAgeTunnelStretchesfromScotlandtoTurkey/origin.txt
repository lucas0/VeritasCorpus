<blockquote>
 <p>
  Across the Europe there are thousands of underground tunnels from the north in Scotland leading all the way down to the Mediterranean.
 </p>
 <p>
  This 12,000-year-old massive underground network is very impressive.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some experts believe the network was a way of protecting man from predators while others suggest the idea that the linked tunnels were used like motorways are today, for people to travel safely regardless of wars or violence or even weather above ground. They could be described as a kind of ancient underground superhighway.
 </p>
 <p>
  Others think the tunnels can be seen as a gateway to the underworld.
