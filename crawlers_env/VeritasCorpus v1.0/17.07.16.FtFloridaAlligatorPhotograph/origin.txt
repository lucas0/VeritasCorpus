  This alligator was found between Lakeland and Winter Haven Florida near the house of Anita and Charlie Rogers, who could hear the beast bellowing in the night.
  <br>
   Their neighbors had been telling them that they had seen a mammoth alligator in the waterway that runs behind their house, but they dismissed the stories as exaggerations.
  </br>
 </p>
 <p>
  “I didn’t believe it,” Charles Rogers said, but after the alligator was killed, they realized the stories were, if anything, understated. Game wardens were forced to shoot the alligator. Joe Goff, a 6’5″ tall game warden, shown below, walks past the 28-foot, 1-inch long alligator that he helped shoot and kill in the Rogers’ back yard.

  This alligator was found between Orlando and Titusville, Florida near a house. How would you like to meet this fella in the dark? Never let it be said that we don’t grow them big in Florida .. Game wardens were forced to shoot the alligator- guess he wouldn’t cooperate…

  This is a real photo of a gator killed in Bay City, TX.

  Lot of South Texas Nuc Plant folk live in this area. Look at the size of  that head!
 </p>
 <p>
  Here is another reason to stay out of the ditches and bayous.

 <p>
  This was found at Bar X, which is between Angleton and West Columbia, near a house. How would you like to meet this fella in the dark? Never let it be said that we don’t grown them big in Texas.
