  In the third season finale “Abyssinia, Henry”, Henry Blake is sent home, to coincide with McLean Stevenson’s departure from the show. In a surprise twist at the end of the episode, the characters learn that Blake’s plane was shot down en route to Japan, and everyone aboard died. This was kept a surprise from the cast (with one exception, Alan Alda) until the moment when Gary Burghoff’s character ran into the operating room to announce the news. The producers’ intent was to capture the cast’s genuine shock and surprise, and to remind the audience that war takes friend and foe alike.
