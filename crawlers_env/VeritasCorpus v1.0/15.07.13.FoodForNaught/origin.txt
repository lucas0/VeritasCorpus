   So you think breakfast at McDonald’s is only Egg McMuffins and other goodies for grownups?

  Well, a McDonald’s outlet in Allentown, Pa., has got something for young ones-the real young ones. Like baby food.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it is a test, one of 15 Big Macs in that market has been offering Gerber baby food not only at breakfast but at lunch and dinner.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether the test will be expanded to other McDonald`s units there or to regional markets could not be determined. It is not even known if the high command at McDonald’s Corp. in Oak Brook is aware of the “new addition” to the menu.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Business is all right,” said the manager of the McDonald’s in Allentown, when asked how parents had responded to baby food served in the jar.
 </p>
 <p>
  When you think about it, baby food makes sense for the fast-food crowd.
 </p>
 <p>
  “You can’t stuff a baby with fries and burgers, especially at breakfast-time,” observes a source.
