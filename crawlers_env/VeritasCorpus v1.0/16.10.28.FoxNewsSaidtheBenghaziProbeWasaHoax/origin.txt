  Current Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton’s alleged wrongdoings have been all over the media. From her use of a private email server, to the Benghazi attacks, Clinton has made national news with headlines proclaiming she can’t be trusted, is a criminal, and needs to drop out of the race. Though there may be some truth behind the reports, even Fox News themselves have reported the Benghazi scandal is a hoax.
