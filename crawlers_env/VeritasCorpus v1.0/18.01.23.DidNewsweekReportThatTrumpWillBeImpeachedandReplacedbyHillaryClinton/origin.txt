  There’s no mechanism in American law for a new election. Nor is there a mechanism for correcting the criminal results of the previous election.

  The question I’m asking here is what should happen if Trump conspired with a foreign government to get elected? If he did that, then what should happen.
 </p>
 <p>
  If that is shown, then the first step is obvious. Trump should resign or, if he doesn’t, he should be impeached.

 <p>
  The second step should be obvious as well: Pence should resign or, if he doesn’t, he should be impeached. He benefited from the criminal (and treasonous) conspiracy just as much as Trump. He shouldn’t benefit even more by becoming the residual President.

 <p>
  Under the law as it is, this leaves Paul Ryan as President. And the hard moral question that Ryan would then face is whether he should remain as President. By hypothesis, we’re assuming the office was effectively stolen from the legitimate winner by a criminal and treasonous act of the (previous) leader of Ryan’s own party. Ryan’s being President is just the fruit of that poisonous tree. So should he just ignore that? Or should he acknowledge the wrong, and act to make it right?
