  Nistorescu, managing director of the daily newspaper Evenimentul Zilei — News of the Day — published his editorial Sept 24, two days after watching a celebrity telethon in New York for victims of the
  <nobr>
   attacks.
  </nobr>
 </p>
 <p>
  Like his other columns, “Ode to America” was meant for domestic consumption. No one knows
  <nobr>
   when — or
  </nobr>
  <nobr>
   how — the
  </nobr>
  article first reached the other side of the Atlantic. But Nistorescu figures it began when someone pulled it off the English-language version of his daily’s Web page and sent it to a friend.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since then, thousands of Americans at home and expats around the world have e-mailed it to friends, saying it captured their nation’s spirit. It has been read out to U.S. soldiers and on radio talk shows and posted on U.S. Web sites.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nistorescu says he had no idea his “Ode to America” would resonate so far
  <nobr>
   away.
  </nobr>
 </p>
 <p>
  Nistorescu remains surprised and touched by the success of the piece, one of thousands he has penned in a more than 20-year career.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It is all about the American spirit and how freedom cannot be crushed,” he says.
