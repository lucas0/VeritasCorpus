  This video clip was widely circulated online in conjunction with the claim that it depicted events in Charlotte. However, many viewers pointed out the red double decker buses viewable passing by in the background of the clip are not a common feature in Charlotte, and that the clip actually originated in London and had nothing to do with Black Lives Matter protests.

 <p>
  That what the video captured took place in London and not Charlotte is documented by a 22 September 2016 British tabloid
  <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/sickening-video-shows-youth-kicking-8888970" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  that reported on an incident just like the one seen in the video:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Sickening footage has emerged of an elderly man being kicked to the ground in what appears to be an unprovoked attack.
  </p>
  <p>
   The incident is believed to have taken place in the Stratford Centre area of London and was published on Twitter.
  </p>
  <p>
   Police have launched an investigation and will be carrying out enquiries around the suspected location in an attempt to identify the victim and suspects.
  </p>
  <p>
   A victim, a man with a white beard and hair, is caught unaware by the vicious attack as he stands at a rubbish bin.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  As reported, the attack occurred in London and had nothing to do with Charlotte or the Black Lives Matter movement, and the homeless victim (presumably also from London) was not described as a “veteran” or recipient of the Purple Heart award.
