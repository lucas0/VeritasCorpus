  We are aware of an erroneous story posted on the Free Republic Website, and possibly elsewhere, which mentions a supposed interview between an unnamed NPR reporter and a U.S. Army Lieutenant General Reinwald. The story is false â€” the dialogue mentioned was not an NPR interview, and it never aired on any NPR program.
