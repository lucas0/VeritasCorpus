 <p>
  Six Virginia State Police troopers have resigned their voluntary positions as chaplains following the implementation of a policy that bans them from referring to Jesus Christ in public prayers.
 </p>
 <p>
  House Republicans blasted Gov. Timothy M. Kaine (D) for the directive, but Kaine’s office said the police superintendent issued the directive.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a statement, Col. W. Steven Flaherty, the State Police superintendent, said he asked chaplains to offer nondenominational prayers at department-sanctioned public events but that the request does not apply to private ceremonies or individual counseling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flaherty said his decision was in response to a recent federal appeals court ruling that a Fredericksburg City Council member may not pray “in Jesus’s name” during council meetings because the opening invocation is government speech.
