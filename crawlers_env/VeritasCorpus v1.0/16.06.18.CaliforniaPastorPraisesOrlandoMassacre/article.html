  A California pastor responded to the June 2016 shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, that killed 49 people and injured over 50 more by praising the gunman and stating that the victims “deserve what they got.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In a sermon delivered the morning after the massacre by Pastor Roger Jimenez of the Verity Baptist Church in Sacramento (and posted to YouTube) Jimenez preached that his congregants should not be grieving for the victims of the shooting at a gay nightclub, equating homosexuals with pedophiles and asserting it was a “tragedy that more of them didn’t die”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   <em>
    “Are you sad that 50 pedophiles were killed today?” Um no. I think that’s great. I think that helps society. I think Orlando, Florida, is a little safer tonight. The tragedy is that more of them didn’t die. The tragedy is I’m kind of upset he didn’t finish the job — because these people are predators. They are abusers. I wish the government would round them all up, put them up against a firing wall, put the firing squad in front of them and blow their brains out.”
