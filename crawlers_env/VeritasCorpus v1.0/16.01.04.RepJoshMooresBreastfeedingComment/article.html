  On 30 December 2015, New Hampshire state representative Amanda Bouldin objected to a bill that would allow cities to outlaw women from showing their nipples, except for when they are breastfeeding. Bouldin’s colleague Josh Moore responded to her comment, saying that women who were inclined to expose their breasts in public should know that men will be inclined to stare and grab at their breasts:

 <blockquote>

   Who doesn’t support a mother’s right to feed? Don’t give me the liberal talking points, Amanda. If it’s a woman’s natural inclination to pull her nipple out in public and you support that, then you should have no problem with a man’s inclination to stare at it and grab it. After all .. it’s ALL relative and natural, right?
