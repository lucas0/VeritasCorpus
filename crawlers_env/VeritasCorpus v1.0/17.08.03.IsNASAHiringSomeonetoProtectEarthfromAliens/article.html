  makes this clear:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   This position is assigned to Office of Safety and Mission Assurance for Planetary Protection. Planetary protection is concerned with the avoidance of organic-constituent and biological contamination in human and robotic space exploration.
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   NASA maintains policies for planetary protection applicable to all space flight missions that may intentionally or unintentionally carry Earth organisms and organic constituents to the planets or other solar system bodies, and any mission employing spacecraft, which are intended to return to Earth and its biosphere with samples from extraterrestrial targets of exploration. This policy is based on federal requirements and international treaties and agreements.

  , the Planetary Protection Office also describes the two-way nature of the job:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   Planetary protection is essential for several important reasons: to preserve our ability to study other worlds as they exist in their natural states; to avoid contamination that would obscure our ability to find life elsewhere — if it exists; and to ensure that we take prudent precautions to protect Earth’s biosphere in case it does.
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   Typically, planetary protection is divided into two major components: forward contamination, which refers to the biological contamination of explored solar system bodies; and backward contamination, which refers to the biological contamination of Earth as a result of returned extraterrestrial samples.
  </p>

  This NASA position, and the concept of planetary protection in general, is far from new. The role of planetary protection officer dates

  about the duties of her job:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   The purpose is explicitly to protect the activities that humans want to do. Initially that would be science, but other things will be done in the future as well. If you wanted to drill into an aquifer on Mars, it would be in the interest of future colonists that you keep the drilling clean because organisms can grow in the aquifer and change the conditions so that it is no longer available. We’ve seen that happen on Earth. That would be really unfortunate.

  of a NASA-published history of planetary protection, Conley described a personal experience that illustrated the importance of planetary protection:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   My interest in planetary protection is much more personal. As part of my laboratory’s research on muscle atrophy, my first spaceflight experiment was flown on the last mission of the Space Shuttle Columbia that tragically disintegrated during reentry on 1 February 2003. Surprisingly, when we opened our recovered hardware several months after the accident, many of our experimental animals had survived the crash.
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   Inadvertently, our research had demonstrated that, if properly shielded, even multicellular animals could survive a meteoritic-style entry event, one of the key steps required for the natural transport of living organisms between planetary bodies. This recognition makes it even more critical that we don’t carry life from Earth with us on missions to search for life elsewhere—otherwise, if we find some, we might not be able to tell the difference!
  </p>

 <p class="p1">
  To be fair to

  , the job does involve protecting Earth from any potential biological contamination brought back home from space as well. For example, the upcoming Mars 2020 Rover mission has
  <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/overview/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    floated
   </span>
  </a>
  the idea of caching samples on the surface of the planet for later return to Earth by another mission. Such proposals must

    be evaluated

  </a>
  by and designed in conjunction with the planetary protection officer to make sure nothing biologically native to Mars would contaminate Earth.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  However, the majority of missions in NASA’s
  <a href="http://archive.is/QjV9f" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    immediate future
   </span>
  </a>
  are either Earth-observing missions or robotic missions to Mars or potentially far off rocky moons like Europa that will not return to Earth. That means much of the job will entail designing strategies to prevent the potential for contamination to these places from Earth, and not — as lightly suggested by

  — serving as an intergalactic “Men in Black” agent.
