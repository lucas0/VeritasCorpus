  In August 2017, just after Hurricane Harvey made landfall and inundated Houston with record rainfall and flooding, celebrity pastor Joel Osteen’s Lakewood Church, which is based in the region, drew criticism for not making itself available to people affected by the storm.

  On 27 August, the church

Samaritan’s Purse has been, since it’s inception, organized to respond to situations just like Hurricane Harvey, and we are grateful to be able to partner with them to provide assistance to the Houston area.

  Osteen, whose own Houston home is worth a reported $10.5 million, has not made any comments regarding possible flooding near the church. A

   video
  </a>
  on Facebook showing a lack of flooding in a garage he identified as belonging to the church. The footage has received more than 70,000 views. He told us:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I was doing recon around my surrondng area and checking up on my work location. Lakewood is always on my route. I was expecting to see flood in the garage area but it wasn’t at all.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  However, he added, “Lakewood and it’s surrounding area was legit flooded out” on 26 August 2017, shortly before the calls began for Osteen to make the church available. Colmenares said he had seen pictures online reflecting effects on the church:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The church was flooded on the inside, garage level, basement level, not where the main floors are. It’s a huge place.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  We contacted the church seeking additional details about why it was inaccessible — for example, if there was possibly flooding nearby or damage to the building — but we have yet to receive a response. However, Osteen did put up the following tweet:
 </p>
