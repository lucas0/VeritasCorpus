  On 8 March 2017, a slew of disreputable web sites reposted an article (first published on TheLastLineOfDefense.org) declaring that Fox News anchor Shepard “Shep” Smith, who has been with the network since it was launched in 1996, had been fired for being too “controversial”:

   BREAKING: Fox News Just Fired Their Most Controversial Anchor
  </p>
  <p>
   Fox News has finally had enough of one of their most controversial anchors. After speaking out against President Trump on multiple occasions and embarrassing the network publicly, Shep Smith has been given his walking papers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rupert Murdoch, head honcho at Fox, told insiders that Shep was let go for his obvious disrespect for President Trump, his unscripted outbursts on live television and allowing his personal life to interfere with his television persona:
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    “Shep has shown that he’s not the kind of anchor suitable for the Fox News audience. While we respect his right to have a liberal opinion and his right to choose his sexual orientation, our viewers don’t need to be exposed to it. Maybe Shep can go work for MSNBC and get a show with Rachel Maddow.”

  None of the above was true, however. Fox News chairman and chief executive officer Rupert Murdoch made no such announcement.
