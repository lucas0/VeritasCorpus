   New research: Men who marry chubby women are happier and live longer
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  According to a new study, men who are in relationships with chubby women tend to smile more and be better at dealing with problems than men who are in relationships with thin women.
 </p>
 <p>
  The study also shows that thin women tend to be more reserved, more unfriendly and less expressive with their emotions.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Argentinian newspaper Nuevo Diario reports on the findings from the research conducted by Dr Filemón Alvarado and Dr Edgardo Morales at UNAM’s department of psychology.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to their research, chubby women make their men ten times as happy as thin women. And we all know that happy people live longer.
 </p>
 <p>
  The study also indicated that chubby women are better at anticipating their partner’s needs.
