  Queen Elizabeth Suspends Wedding After Meghan Markle Calls Herself ‘Liberal Activist’
 </p>
 <p>
  Meghan Markle’s “game-playing and histrionics” over the Christmas weekend left such a bad taste in Queen Elizabeth’s mouth that she has forced the future princess to sign a prenuptial agreement with Prince Harry — or else the wedding is off.
 </p>
 <p>
  The problem with Meghan Markle is that she still insists on calling herself an “activist” on her Twitter page, and she is a noted hater of the President of the United States. That could be overlooked if she would “stop spreading divisive ideology” on her Twitter page and instead “keep a dignified silence on political matters“, but her “unsuitable” behavior over the Christmas weekend has left Buckingham Palace “concerned.”
