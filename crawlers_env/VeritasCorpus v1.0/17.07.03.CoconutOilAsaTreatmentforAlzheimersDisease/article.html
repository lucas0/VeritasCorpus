   Alzheimer’s disease
  </a>
  is an incurable and terminal form of dementia that afflicts millions of sufferers worldwide. While some Alzheimer’s patients live more than a decade after being diagnosed, life expectancy from the onset of noticeable symptoms is usually 7 years. There are no available treatments that halt or reverse the progression of the disease.

  The cause of Alzheimer’s is unknown, although theories abound. Some
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15123336/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   evidence
  </a>
  suggests that one cause could be related to lack of glucose metabolism in certain parts of the brain, as
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4099555/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   described
  </a>
  in a 2014 case study published in
  <em>
   Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience
  </em>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The brain is one of the most metabolically active organs in the body, and under most conditions, relies almost exclusively on glucose for its energy needs. Using [a chemical tracer], the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglc) can be measured. [Chemical tracer] studies in the early 1980s compared AD subjects with normal controls and found significant diminished cerebral glucose metabolism (DCGM) in AD patients.

  Coconut oil contains relatively high levels of medium-chain fatty acids, which break down into ketones in your stomach. Ketones can also be used as a source of energy for the brain (a process called ketosis) and there are at least some suggestions that ketones can help pick up the slack in a glucose-deprived brain suffering from Alzheimer’s. A 2014
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15123336/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   study
  </a>
  published in
  <em>
   Neurobiology Aging
  </em>
  compared the cognitive effects of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s after being treated with either a single dose of a specific chain fatty acid found in coconut oil, or a placebo:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A single 40 g dose of [caprylic triglyceride, a fatty acid] induced mild ketosis and a significant positive correlation between performance on [a] paragraph recall task and [concentrations of ketones in the blood] was found.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The scientific research in this area is in its infancy, and claims that coconut oil specifically, or ketosis in general, can play a role in ameliorating the affects of Alzheimer’s disease require more research.
