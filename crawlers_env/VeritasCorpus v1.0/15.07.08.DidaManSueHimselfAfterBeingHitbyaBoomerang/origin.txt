  “A Kentucky man who threw a boomerang that flew back and clobbered him in the head promptly filed a $300,000 lawsuit against himself — and incredibly, he was awarded the money!

  “The accident occurred on my property so my homeowners insurance was liable for it,” Rutman said of the April 18 accident. “Some of my neighbors say this is crazy but it’s perfectly logical when you think about it. I paid that insurance for a long time just in case something unforseen like this ever happened. And now all those years of paying premiums have turned out to be worthwhile.”
