  I locked my car. As I walked away I heard my car door unlock. I went back and locked my car again three times. Each time, as soon as I started to walk away, I would hear it unlock again!! Naturally alarmed, I looked around and there were two guys sitting in a car in the fire lane next to the store. They were obviously watching me intently, and there was no doubt they were somehow involved in this very weird situation . I quickly chucked the errand I was on, jumped in my car and sped away. I went straight to the police station, told them what had happened, and found out I was part of a new, and very successful, scheme being used to gain entry into cars. Two weeks later, my friend’s son had a similar happening….

  My oldest son Mike came over yesterday – He had to go to Canada for work last week. One of the other engineers traveling to Canada with him, but in his own car, had something happen that I need to share.
 </p>
 <p>
  While traveling he stopped at the roadside park, similar to what we have here with bathrooms, vending machines etc. He came out to his car less than 4-5 minutes later and found someone had gotten into his car, and stolen his cell phone, laptop computer, GPS navigator briefcase… you name it.
 </p>
 <p>
  They called the police and since there were no signs of his car being broken into — the police told him that there is a device that robbers are using now to clone your security code when you lock your doors on your car using your key-chain locking device. They sit a distance away and watch for their next victim. Since they know you are going inside the store, restaurant, or bathroom, they have a few minutes to steal and run. The police officer said to be sure to manually lock your car door by hitting the lock button inside the car. That way if there is someone sitting in a parking lot watching for their next victim it will not be you.
 </p>
 <p>
  When you hit the lock button on your car upon exiting it does not send the security code, but if you walk away and use the door lock on your key chain, it sends the code thru the airwaves where it can be intercepted. I just wanted to let you know about this… it is something totally new to us… and this is real… it just happened this past Thursday June 19th to his coworker…
 </p>
 <p>
  So be aware of this and please pass this note on. Look how many times we all lock our doors with our remotes. Just to be sure we remembered to lock them, and bingo the guys have our code, and whatever was in the car can be gone.
 </p>
 <p>
  I just wanted everyone I know to hear this from me. I never knew about anything like this and do not want this to happen to anyone I know, If we can educate each other on bad things happening.
 </p>
 <p>
  Keep safe everyone!

  Tonight, John and I went to Church, out to dinner, and then to the movies at Loews, on Spring Valley and Central. Apparently, while we were in the movie theatre, someone broke into our car. John’s sun glasses were taken (they are going to be really surprised when they find out they were prescription!). Aside from the glasses taken and the two glove boxes open, nothing else was taken, including the home clicker. Now, here is the really odd part: there was NO forced entry into the car, nothing was broken, scratched, or removed from the outside of the car. We were really baffled as to how anyone could have gotten into the car that we had locked. The answer came from the security guard at Micro Center, who was in the parking lot talking to another man whose car had also been rifled. (In that instance, the man’s wallet, keys, checkbook, and credit cards were stolen.) But there was no forced entry there either. We soon learned that thieves now have some type of high tech gadget that can monitor and replicate the key pad locking device. In other words, when we got out of the car and started to walk away, John hit his key pad to make sure the doors were locked. When it beeped, apparently there was someone in the vicinity who had one of those devices/gadgets and replicated the key lock tone and then used it to get into the auto.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you know of other instances where this has happened, please let the NA’s/HOA’s know, so they can spread the word to our neighbors to be cautious in locking their car doors. If this is indeed how someone could get into our car, then you can bet that from now on I will definitely manually lock all the doors. We will never again get out, walk off, and then use that key pad to lock the car. Great invention, but obviously you have to be discreet in where you use it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Have a great day but keep a ‘heads up’!

   Once again, we are approaching the holiday season and that often means a greater risk of becoming a victim of crime. We suspect that, with the current economic conditions, this year the risk could be even greater than normal. In addition, there is evidence that a new form of automobile burglary has begun to occur around the country. Thieves may be using a device that allows them to copy the signal sent out when automobile owners use their remote key button to lock their vehicles. The thief records the signal and then watches as the intended victim walks away. Then, they simply unlock the vehicle. These aren’t typical car break-ins. There is no broken window, the car lock is intact. It appears thieves may be scanning crowded parking lots with some sort of device, and when they see your lights flash, meaning they’ve made a hit, they help themselves. The only way to avoid this type of crime is to use the car door lock button located inside your vehicle, rather than using your remote locking device. While the Tallahassee Police Department reports they are not aware of this occurring in Tallahassee, they do say that it could be occurring in those instances where victims are unclear as to whether or not they had locked their vehicles.
