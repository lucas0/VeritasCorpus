  On 11 December 2015, German news outlets
  <a href="http://www.mimikama.at/allgemein/ein-hadlf-tisch-im-neuen-ikea-katalog-2016/" target="_blank">
   reported
  </a>
  that a photograph purportedly showing a new Swastika table from IKEA had started circulating on the internet:

  The above-displayed image was posted along with the claim that the “Hadølf” Swastika table was being sold for 88 (which stand for “HH,” an abbreviation for “Heil Hitler”) euros by IKEA. But that is not the case. The retailer released a
  <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/326341-ikea-swastika-table-hoax/" target="_blank">
   statement
  </a>
  shortly after the image went viral:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “It is of course clear that such a table is not part of our program, either in Italy or anywhere else.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  While the above-displayed table is not being sold by IKEA, the image does show a real table.

   created
  </a>
  a “Swastika Table” featuring a mirror image of a swastika as well as words such as as “peace” and “prosperity” written along its edges:
