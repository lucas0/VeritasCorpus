   Although internet commenters pointed out several fishy aspects of this video (for example, the fins don’t ever seem to change directions), the biggest giveaway came from the video’s description:

  by musician Akon went as far as warning tourists to stay away from Miami because of its new shark problem:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In the wake of Irma, many parts of Miami were so badly flooded that some of the ocean’s residents are now swimming up and down the city’s streets. Among them is none other than the infamous shark. If you thought you only had to worry about sharks while chillin’ at the beach, you might want to think again.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most of us would be running in the opposite direction if we saw a bunch of sharks swimming around town. However, this brave soul decided to head outside and record the moment. Seriously though, it looks like something straight out of a scary movie — and we all know that scary movies usually don’t end well.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you’re in Miami, be careful. If you’re not — now certainly isn’t the best time to plan a trip.

  Fake videos and images purportedly showing sharks in odd places tend to gain traction in the aftermath of a hurricane. However, it’s

   As Hurricane Irma hurtles toward Florida and the east coast, you might be afraid of potential shark attacks during the storm — but experts say not to be worried.

  <p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid="266">
   Most sharks are not going to be focused on attacking you during a hurricane, because they want to get themselves to safety, according to Chris Lowe, director of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach.
  </p>
  <p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid="268">
   Sharks — and other fish — are sensitive to barometric pressure, which drops when a storm comes in, Lowe says.
   <a data-reactid="270" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1095-8649.2003.00250.x/abstract" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
    Research has shown
   </a>
   sharks can feel the change in pressure and swim toward deeper water where they’ll be safer. “Most animals will get nature’s alerts and leave,” Lowe says.
  </p>
  <p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid="273">
   Even animals that aren’t as sensitive to the changes in barometric pressure will likely leave for deeper water when they see other animals do so. This is similar to how humans behave before a hurricane — if people see their neighbors evacuating before the storm hits, they may follow suit.

  “ViralVideoLab” wasn’t the first prankster to use a fake shark fin to fool internet users. A very similar
