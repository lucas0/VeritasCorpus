  The Earl of Mowbray describes the adventure of a friend of his, a commander in the Royal Navy, who saw an ad in the

  offering a Rolls-Royce in good condition for the price of £5. He instantly telephoned the offerer. A butler answered and put on her ladyship, the owner, who told him in complaisant tones that indeed the car was for sale and why didn’t he come around to have a look?
 </p>
 <p>
  He did. The Rolls was in excellent condition, had less than ten thousand miles on the clock, and was waxed to a mirror finish. The owner was a middle-aged woman, obviously well off, showing no signs of unworldliness. After signing the appropriate papers and paying for and taking possession of the machine, he asked her how it came about that she was letting it go for so little.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her husband had died recently, she said, and in a late codicil to his will, of which she was the executor, he had directed that his new Rolls be sold and the proceeds turned over to a certain Daisy, with an address in the East End, a run-down neighborhood of London. She was following his instructions to the letter.

 <p>
  Dear Ann Landers: I don’t want to beat a dead horse, but I think this one is good enough to print. It tops the previous letters sent in by readers in support of your theory that truth is stranger than fiction.
 </p>
 <p>
  They backed you up by sending newspaper clippings of happenings no one would believe if they had appeared in your column. The last one, a news item from the Wisconsin State Journal, was about a 5-year-old boy who had been charged with rape.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here’s a lulu from your own back yard – the Chicago Tribune.
 </p>
 <p>
  A man in California saw an ad in the paper for an “almost new” Porsche, in excellent condition – price $50. He was certain the printers had made a typographical error, but even at $5,000 it would have been a bargain, so he hurried to the address to look at the car.
 </p>
 <p>
  A nice-looking woman appeared at the front door. Yes, she had placed the ad. The price was indeed $50. “The car,” she said, “is in the garage. Come and look at it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The fellow was overwhelmed. It was a beautiful Porsche and, as the ad promised, “nearly new.” He asked if he could drive the car around the block. The woman said, “Of course,” and went with him. The Porsche drove like a dream. The young man peeled off $50 and handed it over, somewhat sheepishly. The woman gave him the necessary papers, and the car was his.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, the new owner couldn’t stand it any longer. He had to know why the woman would sell the Porsche at such a ridiculously low price. Her reply was simple: With a half-smile on her face, she said, “My husband ran off with his secretary a few days ago and left a note instructing me to sell the car and the house, and send him the money.”

 <p>
  Jones noted an advertisement in the newspaper offering a current-model Cadillac in prime condition for $50 cash. Certain it was a typographical error, he called the advertiser out of curiosity.
 </p>
 <p>
  To his astonishment, he found that the advertisement was legitimate. The Cadillac was indeed brand-new and it was indeed in spit-and-polish condition. The title of ownership was clear and the price asked was indeed $50. The woman who was selling it calmly accepted the five ten-dollar bills he handed her, wrote him out a receipt, and handed him the keys.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the deal successfully concluded, Jones was driven by curiosity to ask, “But why is it, madam, you have done this? This is a car worth many thousands of dollars. How can you accept fifty?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s quite simple,” said the woman, placing the bill of sale and the money in her purse. “My husband died shortly after buying this car, and in his will he directed that I sell it and that the proceeds go to his mistress.”
