  Tupac Shakur who was supposedly killed at the age of 25 is now admitting he has been hiding this whole time. It was Shakur who in 1996 was reportedly attending a special event in
  <nobr>
   Las Vegas,
  </nobr>
  the Mike Tyson-Benson fight, and then afterwards was brutally murdered. A day or so later he is autopsied, then quickly cremated. There is no funeral. Nor is there any record of a tribute or memorial. Now we know exactly why it was because Tupac Shakur was never killed it is unclear why he has been hiding. This story is still under development but Tupac has already been spotted with Celebrities.
