   published
  </a>
  an image of black smoke rising above Vatican City under the headline “Breaking: Vatican City Bombing”:

  Geller Report also implied that the bombing was carried out by Muslims:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Not to worry, the Pope says Quran is a book of peace and Islam is not a violent religion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ramadan?
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Despite the sensational title and subsequent

   tweet
  </a>
  plugging the article, this image does not show a bombing in Vatican City — because a bombing did not occur. Geller appeared to admit as much in the body of her article:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="mol-para-with-font">
   Plumes of black smoke have filled the sky above the Vatican amid reports of an explosion.
  </p>
  <p class="mol-para-with-font">
   Eyewitnesses spoke of seeing thick smoke coming from a building right next to the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church after a ‘loud boom’.
  </p>
  <p class="mol-para-with-font">
   One news outlet in Rome claimed a large fire had erupted at an auto garage.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  The local news outlet
  <em>
   Rai News
  </em>

   reported
  </a>
  that the smoke was coming from an auto junkyard to the west of the capital, where “a fire of vast proportions” had broken out, causing several explosions.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Twitter account for the local fire station also posted a video of the junkyard fire:

  The exact cause of the fire is still unknown as of this writing. However, the fire did not occur at the Vatican and there have been no credible reports about a bombing in the area. Vatican officials told Catholic.org that the Pope, as well as tourists at the Vatican, were safe and confirmed that the smoke had come from the junkyard

  a few miles away from the holy site:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A garage fire near the Vatican sparked fears that a terrorist attack has struck the holy site. Additional reports of an explosion caused a frenzy of reports that a bomb may have exploded.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, officials in Rome say the Vatican is safe, and the cause of the incident is a garage fire next to the Vatican walls. The Pope as well as the tourists and all others at Vatican City are safe. The fire is presently being extinguished.
