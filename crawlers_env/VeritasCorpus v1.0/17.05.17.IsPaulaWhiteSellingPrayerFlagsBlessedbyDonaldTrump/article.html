   <em>
    Business Standard News
   </em>
  </a>
  (which also goes by BS News) published an article appearing to report that televangelist
  <a href="https://paulawhite.org/" target="_blank">
   Paula White
  </a>
  was selling American flags that had been personally blessed by both herself and President Donald Trump:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Televangelist Paula White, a close confidant of President Donald Trump, is capitalizing on their friendship. White, a notorious proponent of the prosperity gospel, is now hawking “prayer flags,” for $100 a piece.
  </p>
  <p>
   “These flags will enhance your prayer request, since they have been prayed over by both the president and I,” said White in a message on her website.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  This article is not a genuine news item. The
  <em>
   Business Standard News
  </em>
  (which also goes by BS News) is an entertainment web site that does not publish factual stories. The site’s “About” page clearly notes the satirical nature of its articles:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Business Standard News is a satirical site designed to parody the 24-hour news cycle. The stories are outlandish, but reality is so strange nowadays they could be true.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  We checked Paula White’s
  <a href="https://paulawhite.org/" target="_blank">
   web site
  </a>
  to see if there was any overlap between satire and the real world,  but found no sign of her selling American flags blessed by President Trump.
