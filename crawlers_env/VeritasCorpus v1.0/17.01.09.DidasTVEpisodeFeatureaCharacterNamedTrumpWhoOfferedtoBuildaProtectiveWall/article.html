 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Walter Trump, a confidence man, puts on a long robe and holds a tent meeting in the town of Talpa. He tells the townspeople that a cosmic explosion will rain fire on the town and that he is the only one that can save them from death. Ranger Hoby Gilman attempts to prove Trump is a fraud.

  A relevant portion of dialog from this episode has been transcribed below:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Narrator
   </strong>
   : The people were ready to believe. Like sheep they ran to the slaughterhouse. And waiting for them was the high priest of fraud.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Trump
   </strong>
   : I am the only one. Trust me. I can build a wall around your homes that nothing will penetrate.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Townperson
   </strong>
   : What do we do? How can we save ourselves?
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Trump
   </strong>
   : You ask how do you build that wall. You ask, and I’m here to tell you.
  </p>

   Trackdown,
