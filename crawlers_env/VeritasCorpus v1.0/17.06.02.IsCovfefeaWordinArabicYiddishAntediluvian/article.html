  On 31 May 2017 President Trump send a late-night tweet that began with a complaint about his press coverage and ended with the non-word “
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2017/05/31/covfefe/" target="_blank">
   covfefe
  </a>
  ,” baffling many. While “covfefe” jokes proliferated, some began speculating that Trump had not accidentally flubbed the word “coverage,” but instead had been speaking either in code or Arabic.

   However, Google Translate brings up nothing at all for  “covfefe” in Arabic. Only by turning it into two words and adding an apostrophe —

  <span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;">
   — one can create a phrase that Google Translate says means “I will stand up.”

  That’s a bit of a stretch — and it’s not even correct, Rasha Sharif, a linguist and language instructor at the DC-based International Center for Language Studies said. Sharif, who is fluent in multiple Arabic dialects, told us by email, “No, the word has nothing to do with the Arabic language.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, Arabic does not use a “V” sound, which already rules out covfefe or cov fe’fe as a word. Sharif says that she does not trust Google Translate, because
  <a href="http://www.dummies.com/education/internet-basics/how-to-edit-translations-with-google-translator-toolkit/" target="_blank">
   anyone
  </a>
  can edit the translations. “
  <span class="s1">
   I found many words translated wrong in the Language tools,” she said.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="s1">
   So how do you say “I will stand up” in Arabic?
  </span>
  The nearest translation of the phrase is
  <em>
   sa aqif
  </em>
  or
  <span class="s1">
   سأقف, Sharif told us.

  </p>
  <p>
   The term gained popularity prior to the great deluge and was rarely used after the flood subsided. It regained favor around the time Nimrod was building his tower, after which it was entirely lost in translation at Babel.

  about a rare butterfly:

   A few people have asked me about President’s Trump’s tweet in which he used the word “covfefe.” Most people think he meant to write “coverage” and they have had quite a bit of fun with it, but actually it is a real word of Yiddish origin, meaning “a futile search” or “a pointless and false quest.” It was originally transliterated from the Hebrew as “kabfefe,” whose etymology is “kab”—relating to the mystical Qabalah—and “fefe,” which is a word for “butterfly.” What Trump was actually saying in Yiddish tweet-speak was, “We are doing great things despite the press’s negative and pointless search, aka fake news.”
  </p>
  <p>
   For those who are interested, the idea of “covfefe” comes from an old Yiddish tale about a foolish Sephardi rabbi who believed he was called to find and destroy the mythical and rare butterfly known as Benshariza, or “Lucifer butterfly”—a name that comes from “Helel ben Shahar,” meaning “shining star” (see Isaiah 14:12; also see Ephesians 2:2, where Satan is called the “prince of the power of the air”). The rabbi claimed that the Benshariza was recognizable by a unique and disturbing pattern on its huge wings, which looked like the moon and star symbol of the god Ba’al-Hadad. He was convinced that this ominous creature housed “the spirit of Satan” and that if he could destroy it, he would free the world of evil.

  We contacted Ben Kaplan, the Education Administrator at the

   YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, who told us by email, after consulting with colleagues:

 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p1">
   <span class="s1">
    The Yiddish language and literature scholars at the YIVO Institute confirm that “covfefe” is not a Yiddish word.

  Isaac L. Bleaman, a PhD candidate and Yiddish scholar at New York University’s Linguistics Department added:

 <blockquote>

   <span class="s1">
    It is obviously a typo for “coverage.”
   </span>

  <p class="p1">
   <span class="s1">
    I see no clear (or even unclear) connection to Yiddish. As for the legend cited, if you Google the string “kabfefe” there are only 45 results and all are either typos, or related to the covfefe incident. Nothing found in Google Books. So chances are it was made up.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
   <span class="s1">
    The only Yiddish word “covfefe” brings to mind is
    <i>
     kopveytik
    </i>
    ‘headache,’ but that would not make sense in the context of the tweet, and it is not an especially common borrowing into Jewish English. So Trump probably has never heard the word, and certainly wouldn’t use it in his English.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
   <span class="s1">
    We know from Trump’s use of “schlonged” in 2015 (a verb that he took from the Jewish English word for ‘penis’ that ultimately derives from the Yiddish noun
    <i>
     shlang
    </i>
    ‘snake’) that his use of Yiddish borrowings can be rather idiosyncratic. But I don’t think this is one of those Yiddishisms.

    I’d sooner look for a Russian connection.

  “Covfefe” is not a word, nor is it a Nazi, Israeli, or any other type of
  <a href="http://www.gq.com/story/donald-trump-covfefe-theories" target="_blank">
   acronym
  </a>
  . It has no meaning. The President clearly mistyped a tweet, which he later deleted.
