 <p>
  Cable television giant, Time Warner, has released a statement detailing their decision to not renew CNN’s cable TV contact for 2018.
 </p>
 <p>
  The decision comes off of the news that CNN will be barred from the White House press room indefinitely. This, and a steady decline in viewership and credibility likely led to Time Warner’s decision.
