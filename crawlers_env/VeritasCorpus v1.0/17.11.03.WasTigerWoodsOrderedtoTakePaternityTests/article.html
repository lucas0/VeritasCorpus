  In recent years, Tiger Woods’ personal life has provided fodder for tabloid scandals and now, fake news.
 </p>
 <p>
  In August 2017, the notorious “satirical” web site World News Daily Report falsely
  <a href="http://archive.is/D2CEK" target="_blank">
   reported
  </a>
  that a judge in Florida had ordered the golfer to take 137 paternity tests.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The famous golf star Tiger Woods has taken another hit this morning as a state court ordered him to undergo a total of 137 paternity tests. The court’s decision comes after request [sic] formulated by 121 women who claim to have been Wood’s [sic] mistresses and to have given birth to his children.

  The story is fabricated. No such court order has been handed down, and a photograph which the article claims shows “Molly Sanders” and her eight-year-old son “Tommy” is, in fact, a stock photograph that can be found on

   web sites

  with the description “Stock photo of young Caucasian mother with bi-racial 8 year old son smiling.”

  In 2010, a Florida sex worker known as Devon James filed a paternity lawsuit against Woods, claiming he was the father of her then nine-year-old son. In reality, a 2002 DNA test had already established that another man was the boy’s father, and James’ lawsuit was dismissed, according to
