   Help me stop the Sale and use of SPRAY SUNBLOCK!!! DO NOT USE SPRAY SUNBLOCK! We used DG version of coppertone 70 spf. This is what happened to my 9yr old son Hunter. We applied 45 min before Sun exposed an reapplied every 30- 1 hr. He has 3rd degree burn an had to go to children’s burn clinic today where they done a procedure that removed all burnt an dead skin then applied medicine an bandage him up. He can’t be in the sun till we go back to Dr in 1 wk. He can’t take the bandage off nor get it wet. The Dr said healing process could take up to a month. I never thought it would happen to us. I’ve read about it an see more people trying to ban this since it has happened to us. Yeah it’s convenient, yeah it’s easy to Apply, there’s no mess, but from now on we will be using the LOTION SUNBLOCK. so please keep us in your prayers as we go through the devastating accident. When you have to listen to your child scream in pain from them pulling his skin off is the most painful thing to see an experience!
