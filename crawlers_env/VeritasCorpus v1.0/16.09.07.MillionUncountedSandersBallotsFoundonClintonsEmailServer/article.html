  Fake news occasionally proves itself to be more amusing than annoying (i.e., actual satire rather than an attempt to fool readers with sensationalist clickbait), and an August 2016 article from the
  <em>
   Nevada County Scooper
  </em>
  hit that mark — deftly blending political controversies over Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server, suggestions of election fraud, and claims by supporters of rival Bernie Sanders that their candidate had been cheated out of the nomination by a partisan Democratic National Committee into one short article that began:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is in hot water again after nearly 5 million uncounted California electronic ballots were found on her email server by the F.B.I. The majority of those ballots cast were by Bernie Sanders supporters.
  </p>
  <p>
   The election commission has an emergency meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning to discuss a possible vote recount which will include the newly-found ballots.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ms. Clinton has already come under fire during this election cycle over using her private email server for personal use, including storing and sending classified information with it. There has been a formal investigation, but no charges have been filed in that case. Some of the charges are facing several charges.
