  When President George H.W. Bush departed the White House in 1993 after having lost his re-election bid, he did not sulk or criticize the opponent who had defeated him,  Instead, he graciously left a welcoming note behind for his successor, President Bill Clinton, that read as follows:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Dear Bill,
  </p>
  <p>
   When I walked into this office just now I felt the same sense of wonder and respect that I felt four years ago. I know you will feel that, too.
  </p>
  <p>
   I wish you great happiness here. I never felt the loneliness some Presidents have described.
  </p>
  <p>
   There will be very tough times, made even more difficult by criticism you may not think is fair. I’m not a very good one to give advice; but just don’t let the critics discourage you or push you off course.
  </p>
  <p>
   You will be our President when you read this note. I wish you well. I wish your family well.
  </p>
  <p>
   Your success is now our country’s success. I am rooting for you.
  </p>
  <p>
   Good luck,
   <br>
    George
   </br>
  </p>
