 <p>
  Dear Bill,
 </p>
 <p>
  When I walked into this office just now I felt the same sense of wonder and respect that I felt four years ago. I know you will feel that, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wish you great happiness here. I never felt the loneliness some Presidents have described.
 </p>
 <p>
  There will be very tough times, made even more difficult by criticism you may not think is fair. I’m not a very good one to give advice; but just don’t let the critics discourage you or push you off course.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will be our President when you read this note. I wish you well. I wish your family well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your success is now our country’s success. I am rooting for you.
 </p>
 <p>
  Good luck,
  <br>
   George
  </br>
 </p>
