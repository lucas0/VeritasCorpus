  In mid-1966, it would have been hard to find any town in America where, on any given day, at least a few boys weren’t running around with towels attached to the back of their shirts in cape-like fashion, shouting “DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA” in imitation of the titular character and theme song of that year’s smash hit television series,
  <em>
   Batman
  </em>
  .  The show’s comic book origins, camp approach to the superhero genre, pop art sensibilities, parade of special guest villains, and unique two-night-a-week cliffhanger and resolution format all contributed to a massive cultural phenomenon that encompassed not just television, but also a feature-length movie, books, clothing, toys and games, trading cards, posters, and myriad other
  <em>
   Batman
  </em>
  -themed products.

  A significant factor in the tremendous popularity of the
  <em>
   Batman
  </em>
  TV series was composer Neal Hefti’s catchy and memorable theme music, which was “part serious, part silly; just like the series,” combining bass guitar, low brass, and prominent percussion to create a driving, pulsing rhythm that played against animated images of the Caped Crusader and Robin, the Boy Wonder, dispatching a bevy of villainous thugs with their fists to the accompaniment of discordant brass accents and cartoon dialogue balloons reading “SOCK!” “POW!” “ZOCK!”  “WHAP!” “BIFF!” and  “OOOOF!”  The theme’s lyrics consisted of a single word, “Batman,” repeated eleven times by a chorus of voices:

  Some years after the series ended in 1968, the rumor arose that the lyrics (such as they were) to the
  <em>
   Batman
  </em>
  theme song were produced not by human voices, but by brass instruments:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Is it true that the Batman theme song of the 1960’s uses no vocals and is entirely instrumental, played by horns? No one is actually singing “BAT-MAN”?
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  This claim was promulgated by series star Adam West himself in his 1994 autobiography,
  <em>
   Back to the Batcave
  </em>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Everyone was talking or writing about us, wanting an interview, trying to understand and explain the appeal, raving about the innovative
   <nobr>
    camerawork — tilted
   </nobr>
   angles for bad
   <nobr>
    guys — or
   </nobr>
   the lavish sets or Neal Hefti’s catchy jazz score. Old pals would call to congratulate me and also to ask, “Are those horns or voices saying ‘Batman’ during your theme song?” (They were horns.)
