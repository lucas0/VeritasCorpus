  <a href="https://archive.is/4Thl5" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   claims
  </a>
  that the federal government, either through a 2006 law or the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) mandated that pets be allowed to accompany disaster evacuees into hotels and motels. A typical claim read:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   FLORIDA FRIENDS WITH PETS:
  </p>
  <p>
   ATTENTION: If you are evacuating to a hotel/motel and they say they DON’T accept pets, don’t get ugly, but simply tell them that is against the law &amp; FEMA established that after Hurricane Katrina!
  </p>
  <p>
   The Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act (PETS) was a bi-partisan initiative in the United States House of Representatives to require states seeking Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) assistance to accommodate pets and service animals in their plans for evacuating residents facing disasters.

  The 2006 Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act of
  <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/03858" target="_blank">
   2006
  </a>
  essentially mandates that FEMA take into account the needs of pet owners when developing disaster preparedness plans. It also authorizes the director of the agency to fund emergency shelter facilities for pets. It makes no mention of hotels or motels. The summary on Congress.gov reads:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act of 2006 – Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to require the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to ensure that state and local emergency preparedness operational plans address the needs of individuals with household pets and service animals prior to, during, and following a major disaster or emergency.
  </p>
  <p>
   Authorizes the Director to: (1) study and develop plans that take into account the needs of individuals with pets and service animals prior to, during, and following a major disaster or emergency; and (2) make financial contributions, on the basis of programs or projects approved by the Director, to the states and local authorities for animal emergency preparedness purposes, including the procurement, construction, leasing, or renovating of emergency shelter facilities and materials that will accommodate people with pets and service animals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Authorizes federal agencies to provide, as assistance essential to meeting threats to life and property resulting from a major disaster, rescue, care, shelter, and essential needs to individuals with household pets and service animals and to such pets and animals.

  In preparation for Tropical Storm Irene in 2011, FEMA
  <a href="https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2011/12/01/disaster-plan-your-pets" target="_blank">
   advised
  </a>
  pet owners to “locate several ‘pet-friendly’ hotels.” It made no mention of a requirement for hotels to accommodate pets:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   Planning for animal evacuation:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    If you must leave your residence, have a plan for your family pets;
   </li>
   <li>
    Go online and locate several “pet-friendly” hotels in and out of your area;
   </li>
   <li>
    Identify friends or relatives outside your area where you and your pets can stay;
   </li>
   <li>
    If there is a disaster pending, evacuate early with your pets, working animals and livestock; don’t wait for a mandatory evacuation order; and
   </li>
   <li>
    Animals should have leg bands or tattoos, microchips or identification tags with their name as well as your address and phone number.
   </li>
  </ul>

   animals
  </a>
  do have the law on their side when they check in to a hotel. The Americans with Disabilities Act (
  <a href="https://www.ada.gov/archive/qasrvc.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   ADA
  </a>
  ) makes service animals legally exempt from any hotel “pet policies”
 </p>
 <p>
  Bottom line: there is no law that requires hotels to accommodate household pets during a natural disaster. Pet owners should plan accordingly.
