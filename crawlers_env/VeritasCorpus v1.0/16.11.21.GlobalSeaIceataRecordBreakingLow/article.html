  Experts at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center have also noted the same trends, as

 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   “It looks like, since the beginning of October, that for the first time we are seeing both the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice running at record low levels,” said Walt Meier, a research scientist with the Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, who has tracked sea ice data going back to 1979.

    extent
   </span>
  </a>
  . The trends for both are broadly the same, but sea ice extent yields higher estimates because it has a lower threshold for what

  The first thing to be aware of with this graph is that it is not the kind of analysis that climate researchers usually plot. As

  by Jeff Masters on the Weather Underground’s WunderBlog, the NSIDC usually plots both hemispheres separately:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   “At NSIDC, we generally frown on the practice of looking at the global sea ice extent,” said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, “the reason being that ice in the two hemispheres tends to behave rather differently; while Arctic extent shows clear downward trends in all months, the pattern for the Antarctic has been much more complex.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  The overall shape of the combined plot presented by Winepus shows the cumulative contribution of the sea ice in both the Antarctic (which typically reaches its highest extent in the Northern Hemisphere summer) and the Arctic (which typically reaches its highest extent in the Northern Hemisphere winter). The reason for the dramatic divergence this year is that the Arctic and Antarctic are both experiencing anomalously low conditions

  — a rare occurrence.

   <span class="s1">
    agree
   </span>
  </a>
  that the cause of the low sea ice in each hemisphere is likely caused by different phenomena. This year has been especially warm in the Arctic, both in terms of air temperature and sea temperature, as
  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/world/sea-ice-arctic-antarctic-lows/" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    reported
   </span>
  </a>
  by CNN, which is in line with a decades-long trend of reduced sea ice:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   October and November are typically a time of rapid ice gain for the Arctic region, as daylight hours become shorter and shorter and eventually non-existent during what’s referred to as the “polar night.” Air temperatures plummet to below zero degrees Fahrenheit and parts of the Arctic Ocean not covered with ice quickly become covered. But this year, those air temperatures are staying much warmer, closer to the freezing mark of 32 degrees Fahrenheit.
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   To make matters worse, the water temperatures in the Arctic Ocean are several degrees above average, which is an expected result of having less sea ice. With less ice in the summer, more of the sun’s rays can heat the darker water, as opposed to being deflected back into space by the white ice cover. The result is a feedback loop, and one that scientists have warned about for some time.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  The more unexpected finding is the loss of sea ice in Antarctica at this time. Unlike the Arctic, Antarctic sea ice has generally been

   To our south, Antarctica has also just broken a new climate record, with record low winter sea ice. After a peak of 18.5 million square kilometres in late August, sea ice began retreating about a month ahead of schedule and has been setting daily low records through most of September.

  These authors suggest factors that may play a role in the reduced sea ice, including changing wind patterns and warmer sub-surface ocean water rising to the surface, but they ultimately

  , Kaitlyn Tiffany published this statement from the NSIDC:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   The combined number, while easy to derive from our online posted data, is not useful as an analysis tool or indicator of climate trends. Looking at each region’s ice extent trends and its processes separately provides more insight into how and why ice extent is changing. Sea ice in the Arctic is governed by somewhat different processes than the sea ice around Antarctica, and the very different geography of the two poles plays a large role.
