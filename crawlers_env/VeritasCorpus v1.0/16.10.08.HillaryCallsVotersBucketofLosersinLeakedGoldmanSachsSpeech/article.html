   WikiLeaks
  </a>
  published an archive called “The Podesta Emails,” involving communications with Hillary Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta.  Not long after that WikiLeaks dump hit the Internet, multiple Twitter users claimed it documented that Clinton had called progressive voters a “bucket of losers” during one paid speech:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   What we see on the left is way more disconcerting. The early data suggests that while the minority base is probably still dominated by the Democratic messaging, a coalition of sub altern interests is forming that could, with an extremely weak Republican nominee, create and aperture for either a 3rd party victory or, in essence an election inflection point where an insurgent candidate could actually co-opt — take over — a major party.
  </p>
  <p>
   This coalition, a collection of generally under-represented, low social capital individuals has become increasingly networked and increasingly motivated.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    This group that our analysts are calling the ((Makes air quotes)) bucket of losers
   </strong>
   could not only be a significant force in the next election but could, on an outside percentile, even win.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

Of the leaked e-mails, one particular <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927" target="_blank">item</a> (titled "HRC Paid Speeches") caught the attention of social media. After months of calls that Clinton release the content of speeches given to financial entities such as Goldman Sachs, the purported internal document included potentially damaging remarks made by the candidate. In one excerpt dated 29 October 2013, Clinton was quoted as saying something that appeared to contradict her campaign assertions about the top one percent:



<blockquote>But, you know, part of the problem with the political situation, too, is that there is such a bias against people who have led successful and/or complicated lives. You know, the divestment of assets, the stripping of all kinds of positions, the sale of stocks. It just becomes very onerous and unnecessary.</blockquote>


The "bucket of losers" comment eclipsed the relevant e-mail as the most damaging thing found in "The Podesta Emails." However, most social media users appeared to rely solely on circulating screenshots (which could easily be fabricated in the hubbub). A quick search of the <em>WikiLeaks</em> archive revealed that no such phrasing appeared in the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/?q=%22bucket+of+losers%22&amp;mfrom=&amp;mto=&amp;title=&amp;notitle=&amp;date_from=&amp;date_to=&amp;nofrom=&amp;noto=&amp;count=50&amp;sort=0#searchresult" target="_blank">entirety</a> of that dump:

On Twitter, <em>WikiLeaks</em> disavowed the claim:

  The “bucket of losers” rumor was one of many fabrications built upon genuine WikiLeaks dumps, along with other false claims such as ones holding that
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/julian-assange-bernie-sanders-was-threatened/" target="_blank">
   Bernie Sanders
  </a>
  would have won the Democratic nomination but was threatened to drop out of the race, and that Hillary Clinton sought to assassinate WikiLeaksfounder
