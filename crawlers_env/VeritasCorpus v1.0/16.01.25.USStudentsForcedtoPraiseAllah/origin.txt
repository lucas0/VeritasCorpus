 <p>
  As part of the project ‘other cultures’, pupils of OBS Vinkenbuurt visited the Ghulzar-e-Madina mosque in Zwolle. Imam Mawlana Tahier Wagid Hosain Noorani gave a tour of his mosque. All questions that the students had were answered in a fun and understandable way. Students OBS Vinkenbuurt also tried to say the Arabic alphabet. They also have experienced what it is to pray. They have learned a lot during the visit of Islam.
