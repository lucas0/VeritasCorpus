 <blockquote>

   After a dispute with his boss this morning, Mr. Williams admitted in front of a dozen coworkers, that he had ejaculated in her coffee “hundreds of time”.
  </p>

   According to Brian Little, an intern who witnessed the entire scene, Lewis Williams showed no remorse while he confessed his crime.
