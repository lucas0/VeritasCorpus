  This incredible photograph shows a daredevil hanging over a 10,000 ft drop with nothing but his abs holding him up. The photograph, taken in Pedra do Telegrafo, Brazil, show daredevil Luis Fernando Candela, hanging from a cliff face with spectacular views of the Pedra Branca National Park in the background.
  <strong>
   However, all is not what it seems. While he is indeed hanging off a rock by his feet, heâ€™s only about a metre off the ground.
