 <p>
  A hundred and nineteen years after the Treaty of Paris, which enabled the transfer of ownership of Puerto Rico from Spain to the United States, Madrid and Washington have virtually finalized an agreement to return the jurisdiction of the Caribbean island to the European country, endi.com sources have confirmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The deal, which has been negotiated in secret for at least two years, is not yet official, but it has the approval of Presidents Donald Trump of the United States and Mariano Rajoy of Spain and certain technical details are all that remain to finalize.
 </p>
 <p>
  An announcement was expected before the end of the year, but it is possible that the emergence of last-minute complications will delay approval of the transfer until the first days of 2018. The agreement has to be approved by the US Congress, which was occupied until the last hours of his last session by federal tax reform and did not have time to address this issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was reported that the agreement has overwhelming support in Congress. “This has long been done. Moreover, the United States should never have taken possession of Puerto Rico. It was a mistake. Puerto Rico has cost us too much, ” said Alabama Republican Sen. Luke McCullen.
