  An image purportedly showing Elijah Wood posing with his identical twin brother has been
  <a href="http://crenk.com/elijah-wood-scary-has-a-twin/" target="_blank">
   circulating
  </a>
  online since at least 2012:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Elijah Wood has a twin.. scary! I’m seeing two of them!
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  However, the two men displayed in the image above are not twin brothers. They are both Elijah Wood.  This image was created by combing two photographs of the
  <em>
   Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  actor as he posed with fans:

  Both of the photographs used in this composite were taken in December 2012, as Wood (and other celebrities) rallied fans to

  a taco stand in North Hollywood:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The actors are rallying fans around Henry’s Tacos, which has been on the corner of Tujunga and Moorpark for 51 years and is closing Dec. 31 due to a conflict with the building’s landlord.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  (Henry’s Tacos did close down in 2013, but ended up reopening a few months later in a new

  not far from the original building.)

  The composite photograph is also occasionally shared with the claim that it shows Elijah Wood with
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  star Daniel Radcliffe, a nod to the notion that the two actors are actually dopplegangers.
