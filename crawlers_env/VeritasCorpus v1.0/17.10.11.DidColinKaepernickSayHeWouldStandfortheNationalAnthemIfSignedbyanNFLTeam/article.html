  In October 2017, a rumor spread that former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick — who National Football League teams have refused to sign since his 2016 silent protest during the national anthem — had said he would be willing to stand during the national anthem if he was signed by a team.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kaepernick was the first NFL player to sit, and then kneel, during the anthem, in protest against police brutality and racial injustice.

   According to CBS News, which sat down with the out-of-work NFLer for “several hours,” Kaepernick is actively looking for work, and is willing to abdicate his year-long national anthem protest, if only an NFL team would deign to allow him to warm their bench.

 <p>
  The sports web site
  <a href="http://archive.is/6ci2X" target="_blank">
   Bleacher Report
  </a>
  similarly reported:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p data-reactid="151">
   Free-agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who remains unsigned after sitting or kneeling during the national anthem throughout the 2016 season, said he plans to stand if signed by an NFL team. Jason La Canfora of CBS Sports revealed Kaepernick’s intentions Sunday.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  These reports (and others) were ultimately based on claims made by CBS reporter Jason La Canfora, who has since resiled from these claims. The Daily Wire’s story has been updated to reflect that, and the Associated Press has deleted its tweet. However, as of press time, the Daily Wire’s article retained its original, inaccurate headline “QB Colin Kaepernick Now Says He’ll Stand for the National Anthem If He’s Signed to a Team.” As of press time, the Bleacher Report has not yet updated its story.
 </p>
 <p>
  On 7 October 2017, CBS reporter Jason La Canfora appeared on the show
  <em>
   NFL Today
  </em>
  and summarized a conversation he had had with Kaepernick. During that
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c75Sj1_A6I" target="_blank">
   segment
  </a>
  , La Canfora described the player’s determination to return to an NFL team, and claimed:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   He’s not planning on kneeling, he’s going to donate all his jersey sales, and he’s planning on standing for the anthem, if given the opportunity.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  However, a day later Colin Kaepernick appeared to allude to the inaccuracy of that account, in this tweet:
 </p>
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

   The reports that Colin will stand for the anthem are completely false! He has never discussed this with anyone.

  It was not the first time that a news organization reported Kaepernick’s purported willingness to stand during the anthem. In March 2017, Adam Schefter wrote an
  <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/18805744/colin-kaepernick-stand-national-anthem-next-season" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  headlined “Colin Kaepernick to stand during national anthem next season,” in which he cited anonymous sources:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Quarterback
   <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14001/colin-kaepernick" target="_blank">
    Colin Kaepernick
   </a>
   will stand during the national anthem next season, sources told ESPN on Thursday.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kaepernick no longer wants his method of protest to detract from the positive change he believes has been created, sources told ESPN. He also said the amount of national discussion on social inequality — as well as support from other athletes nationwide, including NFL and NBA players — affirmed the message he was trying to deliver.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Schefter did not quote Kaepernick himself in the article or offer verifiable proof. We could not find any evidence to corroborate Schefter’s claim.
