  Tito and Amanda Watts were arrested over the weekend for selling golden tickets to heaven to hundreds of people. The couple, who sold the tickets on the street for $99.99 per ticket, told buyers the tickets were made from solid gold and each ticket reserved the buyer a spot in
  <nobr>
   heaven — simply
  </nobr>
  present the ticket at the pearly gates and you’re in.

  “People can sell tickets to heaven,” a Jacksonville police spokesman said. “But the Watts misrepresented their product. The tickets were just wood spray painted gold with ‘Ticket to
  <nobr>
   Heaven — Admit
  </nobr>
  One’ written in marker. You can’t sell something as gold when it’s not. That’s where the Watts crossed the line into doing something illegal.”
