  The “cute” cocktail carrots that you buy in grocery stores come from deformed crooked big carrots. They are put through a machine to become small cocktail carrots. This part everyone knows.

  After they are cut to size they are soaked in large vats of water mixed with chlorine to preserve them. The same chlorine you use for your swimming pools and laundry. The reason for this is because they don’t have the protection of the skin so they use a good amount of chlorine.

  Notice that after you have stored them in the fridge for a while, a white film forms on them… it’s the chlorine coming to the surface.

  At what cost do we risk our health to have aesthetically presentable VEGGIES? Well Folks… I think after reading this we will all start making our own carrot sticks out of fresh carrots and keep them in the fridge (a few at a time), right?
