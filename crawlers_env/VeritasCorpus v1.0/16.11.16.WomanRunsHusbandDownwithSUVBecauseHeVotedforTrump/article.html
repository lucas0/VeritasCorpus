  reporting that a California resident named Tania Whitmore ran over her husband after learning that he had voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election:

  <p>
   A Californian woman severely injured her husband by hitting him at great speed with her SUV, after he confessed that he had voted for Donald Trump in the last presidential election.

  <p>
   Tania Whitmore, a devoted militant for the Hillary Clinton campaign, allegedly used her Ford Escape SUV to trample her husband, Darrell Johnson, after he told her that he’d voted for Trump.

   Investigators believe that her vehicle was going at more than 65 miles per hour it hit Mr Johnson, around 7:30 this morning. After the collision, it changed direction and ended up crashing into a large tree.

   Officers of the San Diego Police Department rapidly arrived on the site, and were fortunately able to arrest her before she had time to finish her spouse.

  solely traffics in falsehoods and fake news, grabbing various images on the internet to illustrate their clickbait fabrications. The sensational claims inevitably generate traffic on social media, particularly as no other outlets carry the spurious stories it peddles.

  Although a woman was arrested in 2012 for running her husband down after the election, the claim about a “militant” Hillary Clinton supporter striking her spouse with an SUV for voting for Donald Trump was entirely false.
