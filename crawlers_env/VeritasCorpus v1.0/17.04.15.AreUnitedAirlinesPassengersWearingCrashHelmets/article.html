   treatment

  of passenger David Dao in April 2017 (forcibly dragging him off a flight to open a seat for a United employee) manifested itself in a humorous

   photograph

  circulated online, one supposedly showing United Airlines passengers seated in an airliner cabin wearing protective crash helmets as a spoof of the airline’s recent troubles:

  The image depicts the helmeted passengers below the quippy caption, “On an actual @United flight today.” But another Twitter user
  <a href="https://twitter.com/EFCTinyTim/status/852530692143681536" target="_blank">
   pointed
  </a>
  out that signage in the background of the image reflects a different carrier, Condor Airlines.
 </p>
 <p>
  A Condor spokesperson, Susanne Rihm, told us via e-mail that the people captured in the picture are not actually passengers, but rather employees of another company taking part in a safety training course held in a mockup of an airliner cabin:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The interior shown in the picture is NOT a cabin of one of our aircraft. The picture has been taken in the course of a safety training in our safety training mockup at Condor headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Rihm also included a picture of the actual cabin interior for Condor’s 94 aircraft:

  United was subjected to heavy criticism after the footage of Dao’s being dragged off of a flight circulated online. The company
  <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/todayinthesky/2017/04/11/united-clarifies-flight-3411-not-oversold/100331782/" target="_blank">
   admitted
  </a>
  that the flight was not overbooked, contradicting earlier statements regarding Dao’s forced removal from a United Express carrier.
 </p>
 <p>
  The union representing the company’s pilots released a
  <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/united-airlines-pilots-infuriated-by-grossly-inappropriate-dragging-of-passenger/" target="_blank">
   statement
  </a>
  blaming the incident on a “gross excessive force by Chicago Department of Aviation personnel.”
