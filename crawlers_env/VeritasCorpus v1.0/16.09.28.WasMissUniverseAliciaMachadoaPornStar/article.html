  <p>
   CLINTON: This is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said…
  </p>
  <p>
   TRUMP: I never said that.
  </p>
  <p>
   CLINTON: …. women don’t deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.
  </p>
  <p>
   TRUMP: I didn’t say that.
  </p>
  <p>
   CLINTON: And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman “Miss Piggy.” Then he called her “Miss Housekeeping,” because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name.

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Trump didn’t mention Machado’s name but did discuss the 1996 Miss Universe winner, who gained a purported 42 pounds after being crowned. “She was the worst we ever had. The worst. The absolute worst,” Trump, who was an owner of the pageant, said. “She was impossible. She was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner, who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe.”
