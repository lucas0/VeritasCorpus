  On 1 January 2015, the entertainment web site
  <em>
   NC Scooper
  </em>
  published an article reporting that comedian Bill Cosby had received an official pardon from President Obama:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In a startling announcement via executive order, President Obama has pardoned Bill Cosby from any wrongdoing after being charged with the sexual assault of a Temple University employee in 2004. The move, which caught everyone including Bill Cosby off guard, takes effect immediately. Even though the evidence was strong, President Obama felt compelled to pardon the famous comedian of all current and future charges.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Scooper reached out to Mr. Cosby for comment, but we were provided with the following press release.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I know people are tired of me not saying anything, but a guy doesn’t have to answer to innuendos. People should fact check. People shouldn’t have to go through that and shouldn’t answer to innuendos. And just because I’ve received a Presidential pardon, doesn’t mean I’m guilty of anything. To the contrary, it shows I’m innocent.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  There is no truth to this story, which originated with
  <em>
   NC Scooper
  </em>
  , a fake news site that does not publish factual stories:
 </p>
 <blockquote>

  Several false rumors have circulated in the wake of Cosby’s arrest on 30 December 2015. While it’s true that the comedian has been charged with sexual assault, Cosby has not committed
