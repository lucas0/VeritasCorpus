   “Betty’s classic beauty put her on over 300 magazine covers and books. Betty had the greatest hourglass figure of all time:   38-18-36 (inches). She was in thousands of magazine spreads. Her face appeared on full-page ads in Life, Time, Fortune, Look, Saturday Evening Post and other leading magazines of her day. She won over 50 beauty contests before the age of 20. Betty, the ultimate

  These images aren’t the only ones to circulate under the misleading title “Betty White In Her 20s.” Another popular image purportedly showing the star of
  <em>
   Hot in Cleveland
  </em>
  in her 20s has been making the online rounds for several years:
