  On 30 March 2016,
  <em>
   New York Times
  </em>
  columnist Frank Bruni published an
  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/30/opinion/college-admissions-shocker.html" target="_blank">
   op-ed
  </a>
  titled “College Admissions Shocker!” that began as follows:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   PALO ALTO, California — Cementing its standing as the most selective institution of higher education in the country, Stanford University announced this week that it had once again received a record-setting number of applications and that its acceptance rate — which had dropped to a previously uncharted low of 5 percent last year — plummeted all the way to its inevitable conclusion of 0 percent.
  </p>
  <p>
   With no one admitted to the class of 2020, Stanford is assured that no other school can match its desirability in the near future.
  </p>
  <p>
   “We had exceptional applicants, yes, but not a single student we couldn’t live without,” said a Stanford administrator who requested anonymity. “In the stack of applications that I reviewed, I didn’t see any gold medalists from the last Olympics — Summer or Winter Games — and while there was a 17-year-old who’d performed surgery, it wasn’t open-heart or a transplant or anything like that. She’ll thrive at Yale.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The piece concluded by stating:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   At first blush, Stanford’s decision would seem to jeopardize its fund-raising. The thousands of rejected applicants included hundreds of children of alumni who’d donated lavishly over the years, their expectations obvious in the fact that they affixed their $50,000 checks to photographs of Emma playing an obscure woodwind in an Umbrian chamber orchestra or Scott donning the traditional dress of an indigenous people for whom he tailored a special social-media network while on spring break.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fact just 12 hours after the university’s rejection of all comers, an alumnus stepped forward with a financial gift prodigious enough for Stanford to begin construction on its long-planned Center for Social Justice, a first-ever collaboration of Renzo Piano and Santiago Calatrava, who also designed the pedestrian bridge that will connect it to the student napping meadows.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  While many readers immediately picked up on the column’s satirical nature, others didn’t spot the joke despite the article’s heavy-handed absurdity. “College Admissions Shocker” quickly appeared on the list of top Twitter trends:

   For anyone planning to apply to Stanford: be warned.

  Bruni didn’t tweet anything directly about the nature of his column, but he did retweet a mention that referred to it as a “lampoon”:

  The column was contradicted by content published to Stanford University’s own Facebook page on 25 March 2016 noting that they had accepted 2,063 students for the upcoming academic year:

  While social media users poked fun at those who didn’t immediately get Frank Bruni’s “College Admissions Shocker!” joke, the
  <em>
   New York Times
  </em>
  ‘ presentation of the piece didn’t explicitly state it was satire.  Some readers might have believed the column to be on the level because the ins-and-outs of elite college admissions remain an arcane subject, the paper published it to social media channels without qualification (and using a standard
  <em>
   Times
  </em>
  -branded graphic), and both the column and the posts were dated 30 March 2016 (not 1 April, a date that people associate with tomfoolery).
