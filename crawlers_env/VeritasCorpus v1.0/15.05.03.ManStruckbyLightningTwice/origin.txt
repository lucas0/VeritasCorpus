  Direct [lightning] strikes occur when the victims are outside, often carrying metal objects, such as an umbrella. Metal (e.g., a hairpin) worn in the hair increases the chances of a direct strike compared with a metal object worn lower on the body. Although not always fatal, direct strikes are associated with high morbidity, because they frequently involve the head. Lightning strikes near the head may enter the eyes, ears, and mouth to cause multiple problems.

  Lightning can cause mild to severe damage to numerous body systems. Although the current from lightning may flow through the victim’s body for only a short time, it can short-circuit the body’s electrical systems, such as the heart and the respiratory center of the brain.
