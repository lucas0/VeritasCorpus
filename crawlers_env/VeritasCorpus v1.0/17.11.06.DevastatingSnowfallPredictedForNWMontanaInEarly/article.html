   Meteorologists at NASA’s Charles Darwin Research Facility have recently discovered a disturbing cosmic anomaly that they are certain will cause record snowfalls to hit the entire Northwest Corridor this coming winter. Northwest Montana will face the brunt of this storm, with snowfall levels predicted to reach 34 feet in the month of January alone. If that’s not enough, winds of up to 120 mph are predicted to prevail throughout most of the latter half of January, and into early February.
