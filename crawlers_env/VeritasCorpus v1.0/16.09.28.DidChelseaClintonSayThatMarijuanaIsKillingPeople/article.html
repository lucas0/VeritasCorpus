  At a 24 September 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign event in Youngstown, Ohio, her daughter Chelsea controversially asserted that “anecdotal evidence” from Colorado indicated that marijuana use (which is now legal in that state) has led to drug interaction fatalities:

    But we also have anecdotal evidence now from Colorado where some of the people who were taking marijuana for [medicinal] purposes … the coroner believes … after they died, there was drug interactions with other things they were taking

  The younger Clinton didn’t expressly state that marijuana use itself could be fatal, but she did maintain that “anecdotal” evidence from Colorado included coroners’ reports of deaths caused by adverse interactions of marijuana (taken for medicinal purposes) with other drugs (presumably of the prescription, rather than recreational, variety).

  In a broader context Clinton seemed to be

   [My mother] absolutely supports more research. One of the challenges with the experiments happening around the country at the state level — she supports states making whatever choices they think are right vis-à-vis medical and recreational marijuana use — is that we have no real way to study them.  So that anecdotally we have lots of evidence in the area you talked about, in epilepsy, but also in autism, in stimulating appetite for people who are on intensive chemotherapy regimens, for people who have non-epilepsy seizure disorders and challenges.  But we also have anecdotal evidence now from Colorado where some of the people who were taking marijuana for those purposes, the coroner, after they died, there was drug interactions with other things they were taking.  And so one of the reasons we really do need rigorous study into your point about rescheduling marijuana is one, we want to know where it works and where it doesn’t work, because probably there’s some areas where it works and probably there’s some areas where it doesn’t work, like other things that we think have medicinal uses.  But two, one of the reasons the FDA has such rigorous testing, and one of the reasons our FDA approval process is the gold standard for the world, is the rigorous study of how new proposed drugs interact with drugs that are already on the market, both prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs.  That’s why if any of us get a prescription, there are all of those warnings “be careful” and “don’t use heavy machinery or drive or don’t drink alcohol,” but sometimes they’re really explicit instructions, “if you are taking these four drugs please make sure your doctor knows that before you start this prescription.”  We just need so much more data than we have so that people who might benefit have the chance to benefit, people who might be in danger are protected. So absolutely my mom strongly supports the need for more rigorous study and then subjecting it as we do with everything else that might have a medicinal purpose to FDA approval, scrutiny, and ultimately regulation.
