  In April 2017,
  <em>
   Now44News
  </em>
  reworked a years-old
  <a href="http://archive.is/IhRBk" target="_blank">
   legend
  </a>
  into an
  <a href="https://archive.is/aqEwF" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  reporting that a teen boy died of “orgasmic shock” immediately after masturbating 46 times in a row:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Jerome Carpenter was found dead in his bedroom after apparently masturbating too much. It is speculated that Jerome was suffering from depression due to being “extremely lonely” and not getting no P*ssy for 3 days.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jerome’s Mother called Portland police after discovering his corpse in his room. Jerome’s mother told Now44News reporters “1 hour passed since I had called him down for lunch, Jerome was the kind of boy to steal food off your plate when you were not looking, i knew something was wrong when he didn’t come down to eat, he was a great kid” she finished as she began to cry.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Like similar dubious claims, the story had plenty of holes (such as the question of precisely how anyone might have known how many times the boy pleasured himself before suddenly expiring).
