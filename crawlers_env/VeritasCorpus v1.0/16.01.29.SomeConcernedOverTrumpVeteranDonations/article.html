  While most of the leading Republican presidential candidates attended a Fox News-hosted debate in Iowa on 28 January 2016, Donald Trump boycotted the event (as a protest over Fox’s allowing Megyn Kelly, whom Trump felt had asked him “unfair questions in a previous debate, to serve as a moderator) and instead hosted his own event as a fund-raiser for veterans.

  Trump instructed supporters to visit the

  of the Donald J Trump Foundation for Vets in order to make donations to the cause. Some potential donors were skeptical, however, as the receiving entity was listed as the Donald J Trump Foundation and not a veterans’ charity:

  While it’s true that the $6 million raised by Trump during his veterans’ charity event on 28 January 2016 was initially paid to The Donald J Trump Foundation, that foundation is supposed to disburse the donations, along with another $1 million donated by Trump himself, to a variety of veteran’s

   The GOP front-runner, who hosted his own event in Des Moines, Iowa, after boycotting the Republican debate just three miles down the road, announced that he had raised $6 million to donate to veterans groups. Trump donated $1 million of his own money to the cause.
