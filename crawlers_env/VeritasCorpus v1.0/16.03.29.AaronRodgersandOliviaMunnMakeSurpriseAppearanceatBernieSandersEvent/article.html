  On 29 March 2016, the entertainment web site
  <em>
   United Media Publishing
  </em>
  published an article reporting that Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and actress Olivia Munn had attended a rally for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in Appleton, Wisconsin:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and actress/model girlfriend Olivia Munn made a surprise public appearance together at the Fox Cities Performing Arts Center in Appleton, WI, Tuesday morning to show support for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.
  </p>
  <p>
   The superstar couple kept a low profile and spoke only briefly with press and fans. “Today is about Bernie Sanders,” Rodgers told the Plymouth Review, “his message is resonating with the youth of this country and it’s an exciting thing to witness.” Olivia credits Senator Sanders for getting her interested in politics again. “Bernie is one of those once-in-a-lifetime candidates. I think he would make a wonderful president,” said Munn.

  fake news site. Although the
  <em>

  web site does not carry a readily available disclaimer identifying its content as fiction, the site has a track
