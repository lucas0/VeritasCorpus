  On 18 April 2016, the entertainment web site
  <em>

  published an article reporting that South Africa had passed a law requiring people with human immunodeficiency virus to get a tattoo on or near their genitals marking them as HIV-positive:

  Since then, this story about HIV genital tattoos has been reported by dozens of disreputable web sites. While South Africa’s president Jacob Zuma has not commented on this story, Justice Edwin Cameron of the Constitutional Court of South Africa told the
