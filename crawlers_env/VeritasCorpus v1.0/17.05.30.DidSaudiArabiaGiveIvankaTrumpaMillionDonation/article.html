  On 21 May 2017, the web site
  <a href="http://archive.is/4Ipbb" target="_blank">
   Resistance Report
  </a>
  published an article claiming that the government of Saudi Arabia had donated $100 million to “Ivanka Trump’s female entrepreneurship fund”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   President Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia was fortuitous for both the Islamic nation and for the Trump family — specifically First Daughter Ivanka.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the same weekend that Jared Kushner — Ivanka’s husband — brokered a $100 billion arms deal with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, officially the largest arms sale in U.S. history, the Saudis reciprocated by donating $100 million to Ivanka Trump’s female entrepreneurship fund.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  A similar version of the story appeared on the
  <a href="http://archive.is/rppKq" target="_blank">
   USA News Post
  </a>
  web site the next day.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Resistance Report cited a 21 May 2017
  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-u-a-e-pledge-100-million-to-world-banks-women-entrepreneurs-fund-1495339028" target="_blank">
   Wall Street Journal
  </a>
  article which stated, more accurately:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The World Bank announced Sunday at an event with Ivanka Trump, the U.S. president’s daughter and senior White House adviser, that Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates have pledged a combined $100 million to a fund that will assist women entrepreneurs and small business owners.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  That article described Trump as “an advocate for businesswomen who proposed the fund.”
 </p>
 <p>
  A spokesperson for the World Bank told us that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had pledged a
  <em>
   combined
  </em>
  $100 million towards what it called “a facility to assist women entrepreneurs in developing countries.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The spokesperson emphasized: “It will not be a “fund,” in that we see it providing training, mentoring, and policy advice as well as finance,” and confirmed:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   There will be no “Ivanka Trump Fund” at the World Bank…Ivanka Trump would play no operational or fundraising role for this facility.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Trump did champion the idea, and was present at an event in Saudi Arabia, where the World Bank project was announced.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only will Trump have no role in running or raising funds for the project, there also does not appear to be a way in which she could stand to gain financially from it. The World Bank spokesperson told us:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   It is difficult to envision how any individual in an industrial country could personally benefit from a facility to provide assistance to women in developing countries.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  For all these reasons, it’s grossly misleading to claim, as the Resistance Report did, that Ivanka Trump “got a $100 million donation from Saudi Arabia”. This claim is rendered even less accurate by the fact that the figure of $100 million relates to a
  <em>
   combined
  </em>
  pledged donation from both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
