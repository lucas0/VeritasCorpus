  However, probably even more shocking than that, came afterward when Jolie told reporters she would give away her 6 beautiful adopted children, telling reporters “These children remind me of that lowlife scumbag i used to call my husband, i never want to see them again, i’m sending them to Africa. I need to focus on my career and Malificent Two, which i will be in.”
