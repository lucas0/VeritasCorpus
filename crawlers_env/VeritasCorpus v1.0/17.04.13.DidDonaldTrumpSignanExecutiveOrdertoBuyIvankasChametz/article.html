  President Donald Trump was subjected to similar treatment after he was photographed holding an executive order he had signed in January 2017.

  <p>
   Among the three executive orders President Trump signed Monday was one reinstating the Mexico City Policy, which deals with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and abortion access.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Mexico City Policy was originally announced by President Reagan in 1984 and required nongovernmental organizations to agree as a condition of receiving any federal funding that they “would neither perform nor actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations.”
