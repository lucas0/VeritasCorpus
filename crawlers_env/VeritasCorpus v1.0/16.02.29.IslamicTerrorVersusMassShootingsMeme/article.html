  On 25 February 2016, a Facebook user shared the above meme:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Scary map of all Islamic terror attacks in the US. JK, it’s just all mass shootings by Americans since Sandy Hook
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The map provided no sources, dates, or information about what constitutes a mass

   shooting
  </a>
  .  As it turned out, it was taken from a 21 February 2016
  <i>
   Vox

  <a href="http://www.vox.com/a/mass-shootings-sandy-hook" target="_blank">
   piece
  </a>
  sourced from the
  <a href="http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/" target="_blank">
   Gun Violence Archive
  </a>
  , using their specific definition for what makes a “mass shooting event”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The counts come from the Gun Violence Archive, a database that tracks events since 2013 in which four or more people (not counting the shooter) were shot at the same general time and location. The database’s researchers comb through hundreds of news stories, police reports, and other sources each day and individually verify the reports. Still, since some shootings aren’t reported, the database is likely missing some shootings, and some are missing details.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The inconsistency in definitions for the term “mass shooting” provided some ambiguity. As
  <em>
   Vox
  </em>
  noted, the Gun Violence Archive also counted shootings in which individuals were shot but not killed (whereas many others counted only shootings where four or more victims died).
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   But not everyone agrees with this definition. Northeastern University criminologist James Alan Fox, for example, defines mass shootings more widely, as any shooting in which at least four people were murdered. Under those terms, mass shootings don’t appear to be increasing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health call the definition Fox uses too broad, since it catches domestic, gang, and drug-related shootings that aren’t usually considered mass shootings in layman’s terms.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Gun Violence Archive is even broader — counting not just murders but injuries, too.

  We tried to track down a map showing attacks motivated by Islamic terrorism in the United States. We were unable to find either a list or a map that showed that information, although we did find a

  from 2015 contrasting fears of Islamic terror attacks with a measurable number of “homegrown extremist” incidents. In 2014, CNN

  to come by.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the Sandy Hook shootings, we found two confirmed instances of attacks that appeared motivated by Muslim extremist ideology on American soil. One was the April 2013 Boston Marathon
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Marathon_bombing" target="_blank">
   bombing
  </a>
  , the other the December 2015 San Bernardino
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Marathon_bombing" target="_blank">
   attacks
  </a>
  . Five people died in the Boston attacks, and 14 in San Bernardino (excluding the attackers), bringing the combined total to 19 deaths in the United States attributed to Islamic terrorism since December 2012, when gunman Adam Lanza shot and

   killed
  </a>
  20 children and six women at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
 </p>
 <p>
  An accurate map of fatal incidents on American soil attributable to Islamic terrorism since December 2012 would, then, look something like this:
