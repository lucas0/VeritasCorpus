  Israel has recently banned Heinz Ketchup from the country and they say it’s because it doesn’t have high enough amount of tomatoes in it. But there are a couple of more reasons why it was banned … Heinz is loaded with high fructose corn syrup which is extremely unhealthy. The corn syrup is made of GMO corn and this is what makes it so dangerous. It can cause a rapid increase in your blood sugar levels and damage your liver.
