  web site reported that Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) had blamed inaction on climate change and healthcare for a terrorist attack two days earlier in

  , which left at least seven people dead.
 </p>
 <p>
  The story, titled, “Maxine Waters Degrades Herself With Tone-Deaf Tweet,” included this tweet:
 </p>
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
  <p dir="ltr" lang="en">
   Please pray for the safety of our Muslim brothers and sisters in
   <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/London?src=hash" target="_blank">
    #London
   </a>
   . Our inaction on climate and heathcare has pushed them to this.

  The tweet was sent from @MaxineVVaters, a parody account that has no connection to the California Congresswoman. The account handle is cleverly designed to trick users into mistaking it for @MaxineWaters, her real account, which Twitter has verified with a blue checkmark.

  On 1 June 2017, the parody account gained traction for an amusing

   tweet

  that suggested Representative Waters had mistaken the daily ebb and flow of the tides with climate change.
