  reported that documents released by WikiLeaks show Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton wants to end to the United States and replace it with a “Hemispheric Government” because she is an “extreme globalist”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The most frightening thing about the recent Wikileaks drop, which included excerpts of Hillary’s paid Wall St. speeches is her excitement over ending the United States as we know it.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hillary is an extreme globalist.
  </p>
  <p>
   She not only embraces the globalist mentality but she actually wants to end the U.S. as we know it and replace it with a “Hemispheric Government.”
  </p>
  <p>
   No wonder Angela Merkel is her “favorite leader.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Hillary wants to turn the United States into Germany — or worse.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  TruthFeed is, of course, wading deep into conspiracy theory territory, pushing idea that a secret cabal of global elites are plotting an overthrow of democratic governments to form an autocratic New World Order.

  The material referenced by TruthFeed was Clinton campaign e-mail correspondence published by WikiLeaks that revealed excerpts from paid speeches  Hillary Clinton gave in recent years, before her presidential bid.  As the
  <em>
   Wall Street Journal
  </em>
  noted, the e-mails “appear to show Mrs. Clinton taking a tone in private that is more favorable to free trade and to banks than she has often taken on the campaign trail”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The WikiLeaks documents suggest Clinton campaign research director Tony Carrk emailed excerpts of Mrs. Clinton’s speeches to senior campaign officials, including [campaign chairman John] Podesta and communications director Jennifer Palmieri, calling them the “flags from HRC’s paid speeches.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Mr. Carrk said he had obtained the transcripts from “HWA,” an apparent reference to the Harry Walker Agency, which arranged Mrs. Clinton’s paid speeches after she left the State Department in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I put some highlights below,” Mr. Carrk wrote. “There is a lot of policy positions that we should give an extra scrub with Policy.”
