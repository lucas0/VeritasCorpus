  The Food and Drug Association (FDA) has announced this morning that it has approved pharmaceutical giant Johnson &amp; Johnson’s request to produce and sell tranquilizer dart guns specially developed to put kids to sleep.
 </p>
 <p>
  The alleged new medical device would allow parents to put a child to sleep within 4 seconds, and is said to have no serious longterm consequences on the child’s health.
 </p>
 <p>
  There has been a high demand for such a device for years now, explains to us Ernie Knewitz, media relations vp over at Jonhson and Johnson. We have tested over hundreds of recipes to finally find one that doesnt cause too much damage to the brain despite regular use. We have finally found a mix of PCP and a heroin derivative that seems to do the job.
