  On January 21 at 1:21 PM EST George Zimmerman was found dead in the backyard of his Florida home. Police say he was stabbed multiple times and had a gunshot wound to the head. A neighbor of Zimmerman said she heard a commotion, looked over the wall and saw him lifeless on the ground. That’s when she called 911.

  The murder of George Zimmerman happened just months after his controversial September 2015 Twitter post spread across social media, angering many Trayvon supporters. Zimmerman retweeted a photo of Trayvon Martin’s lifeless body with criminal justice investigator standing above him. The original post was tweeted by one of the Zimmerman’s fans, praising him as
  <strong>
   <em>
    “a one-man army.”
   </em>
  </strong>
  Zimmerman, apparently flattered, retweeted the image.
