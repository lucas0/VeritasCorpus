  Many listeners have been fascinated by a

   recording
  </a>
  that was supposedly produced from slowed-down tapes of crickets chirping, producing something that sounds remarkably like a human chorus:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Composer Jim Wilson has recorded the sound of crickets and then slowed down the recording, revealing something so amazing. The crickets sound like they are singing the most angelic chorus in perfect harmony. Though it sounds like human voices, everything you hear in the recording is the crickets themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I discovered that when I slowed down this recording to various levels, this simple familiar sound began to morph into something very mystic and complex … almost human.”

  Musician Tom Waits referenced this piece of cricket music in a 2008 NPR

  as the most interesting recording he owned:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Q: Most interesting recording you own?
  </p>
  <p>
   A: It’s a mysteriously beautiful recording from, I am told, Robbie Robertson’s label. It’s of crickets. That’s right, crickets. The first time I heard it … I swore I was listening to the Vienna Boys Choir, or the Mormon Tabernacle choir. It has a four-part harmony. It is a swaying choral panorama. Then a voice comes in on the tape and says, “What you are listening to is the sound of crickets. The only thing that has been manipulated is that they slowed down the tape.” No effects have been added of any kind, except that they changed the speed of the tape. The sound is so haunting. I played it for Charlie Musselwhite, and he looked at me as if I pulled a Leprechaun out of my pocket.
