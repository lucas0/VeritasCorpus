<blockquote>
 <p>
  In the weeks after passing a bill, allowing West Virginians to drink raw milk, one delegate brought the drink in to celebrate and, eventually, several lawmakers have gotten sick.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some lawmakers say itâ€™s just a coincidence and a stomach bug is going around.
 </p>
 <p>
  But, now, health officials are planning on looking in to how this all started.
 </p>
 <p>
  An anonymous complaint is in at the state Department of Health and Human Resources.
 </p>
 <p>
  And now, state health officials have to investigate why at least one person is saying the raw milk was given illegally and got these lawmakers sick.
