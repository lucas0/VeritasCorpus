August 27 at 00:30 Lift up your eyes and look up at the night sky. On this night, the planet Mars will pass just <NOBR>34.65</NOBR> million miles from the earth. To the naked eye it looks like two of the moon above the ground! The next
time Mars will be so close to the Earth as much as in 2287. Share the news with your friends, because no one living on this earth has ever seen this!

Two moons on 27th August 2010

27th Aug the Whole World is waiting for.............

Planet Mars will be the brightest in the night sky starting August. It will look as large as the full moon to the naked eye. This will cultivate on <NOBR>Aug. 27</NOBR> when Mars comes within <NOBR>34.65M miles</NOBR> off earth. Be sure to watch the sky on <NOBR>Aug. 27</NOBR> <NOBR>12:30 am.</NOBR> It will look like the earth has <NOBR>2 moons.</NOBR>

The next time Mars may come this close is in 2287.

NO ONE ALIVE TODAY will ever see it again.

The Red Planet is about to be spectacular! This month and next, Earth is catching up with Mars in an encounter that will culminate in the closest approach between the two planets in recorded history. The next time Mars may come this close is in 2287. Due to the way Jupiter's gravity tugs on Mars and perturbs its orbit, astronomers can only be certain that Mars has not come this close to Earth in the Last 5,000 years, but it may be as long as 60,000 years before it happens again.

The encounter will culminate on August 27th when Mars comes to within 34,649,589 miles of Earth and will be (next to the moon) the brightest object in the night sky. It will attain a magnitude of -2.9 and will appear <NOBR>25.11 arc</NOBR> seconds wide. At a modest <NOBR>75-power</NOBR> magnification Mars will look as large as the full moon to the naked eye. Mars will be easy to spot. At the beginning of August it will rise in the east at <NOBR>10 p.m.</NOBR> and reach its azimuth at about <NOBR>3 a.m.</NOBR>

By the end of August when the two planets are closest, Mars will rise at nightfall and reach its highest point in the sky at <NOBR>12:30 a.m.</NOBR> That's pretty convenient to see something that no human being has seen in recorded history. So, mark your calendar at the beginning of August to see Mars grow progressively brighter and brighter throughout the month. Share this with your children and grandchildren. NO ONE ALIVE TODAY WILL EVER SEE THIS AGAIN

  Some things never go out of style, and this “Mars Spectacular” message is one of them. It’s yet another example of a widely-circulated e-mail containing information that was once true but which continues to
  <br>
   be forwarded around year after year, long after the information it contains has become outdated.
  </br>
 </p>
 <p>
  Mars
  <u>
   did
  </u>
  make an extraordinarily close approach to Earth over ten years ago, culminating on
  <nobr>
   27 August
  </nobr>
  2003, when the red planet came within
  <nobr>
   35 million
  </nobr>
  miles (or
  <nobr>
   56 million
  </nobr>
  kilometers) of Earth, its nearest approach to us in almost 60,000 years.  At that time, Mars appeared approximately
  <nobr>
   6 times
  </nobr>
  larger and
  <nobr>
   85 times
  </nobr>
  brighter in the sky than it ordinarily does. (One version of the message was often reproduced with an unfortunate line break, leaving some readers with the mistaken impression that Mars would “look as large as the full moon to the naked eye” without realizing that that statement only applied to those viewing Mars through a telescope with
  <nobr>
   75-power
  </nobr>
  magnification.)
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Mars’ proximity to Earth in
  <nobr>
   August 2003
  </nobr>
  (referred to as a
  <nobr>
   <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/watchtheskies/18jun_approachingmars.html" target="_blank">
    perihelic opposition
   </a>
  </nobr>
  ) was a rare occurrence, the red planet comes almost as near to us every 15 to
  <nobr>
   17 years.
  </nobr>
  To the unaided observer, Mars’ appearance in August 2003 wasn’t significantly larger or brighter than it is during those much more common intervals of closeness.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mars had another
  <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2005/27may_approachingmars.htm" target="_blank">
   close encounter
  </a>
  with Earth in 2005, but that occurrence took place in October (not August), and the red planet appeared about 20% smaller than it did during similar circumstances in 2003.   Mars also made a close approach to Earth in
  <nobr>
   December 2007,
  </nobr>
  but even then it was still about
  <nobr>
   55 million
  </nobr>
  miles away from us, not nearly as close as it was in 2003 or 2005.  Not until 2018 will our view of Mars be similar to the one that was available in 2003, and it won’t be until the year 2287 that Mars will come closer to Earth than it did back in 2003.

As for 2014, <I>EarthSky</I> <A HREF="http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/double-moon-on-august-27" TARGET=rep target="_blank">reports</A> that:

<FONT FACE="" class="quote_font" SIZE=2>
<DIV STYLE="" class="quote_style">
The moon will not be full on August 27, 2014 (you might spot it briefly as a thin crescent in the west after sunset, though). And Mars will not be at its brightest or closest in August of 2014, or at any time in 2014. In 2014, Mars is closest to Earth on <NOBR>April 8,</NOBR> but it won’t be as close this year as in some years.

  Texas astronomer Torvald Hessel observed the following in a 2006 interview about the perennial “Mars Spectacular” message:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Q: What’s the truth?
  </p>
  <p>
   A: Mars gets close to Earth every two years. So, last year, Mars was very close. Three years ago, it was spectacularly
   <nobr>
    close …
   </nobr>
   And right now, I’m sad to say, Mars is actually behind the Sun; we can’t see it at all.
  </p>
  <p>
   Q: How wide spread is this falsehood?
  </p>
  <p>
   A: People get excited about it, start to send
   <nobr>
    e-mail …
   </nobr>
   and every August we see this
   <nobr>
    e-mail
   </nobr>
   coming back and I get a lot of e-mails about it, of course.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum also
  <a href="http://blog.nasm.si.edu/astronomy/a-%E2%80%98spectacular%E2%80%99-hoax-continues-to-fool-email-readers/" target="_blank">
   noted
  </a>
  in 2010 that:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The e-mail in question is commonly referred to as the “Mars Hoax” or, more accurately, the “Mars Spectacular,” and is titled: “Two moons on 27 August or The Red Planet is about to be spectacular!”
  </p>
  <p>
   It informs recipients that Mars will have an extremely close encounter with Earth during the month of August, culminating on August 27th when Mars is approximately 34 million miles away.
   <em>
    The information in the previous sentence was only true during the month of August in 2003.
   </em>
   This was a historic astronomical event. Mars was the closest it had been to Earth in 60,000 years.
   <em>
    However, this already happened.
   </em>
