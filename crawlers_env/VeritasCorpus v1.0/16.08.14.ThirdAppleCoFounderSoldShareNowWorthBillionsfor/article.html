  People all over the world recognize the name and face of the late Steve Jobs, the visionary who co-founded Apple Computer in 1976 and led the company through the development of such revolutionary products as the Apple II computer, the Macintosh, and the iPod portable music player.  Not quite as well known but still fondly remembered by computer aficionados is Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, who developed the company’s first two products (the Apple I and Apple II) but afterwards held a much less visible role in the company’s operations than Jobs did.

  What many people don’t know is that Apple actually had a third co-founder, Ronald Wayne.  Wayne’s name (and potential fortune) have been lost in the mists of time because he left Apple and sold off his interest the company early on, thereby letting go of shares that would later be worth billions of dollars.

  Back in the early days of Apple, when the company was little more than an idea and a name, Steve Jobs brought in Ronald Wayne, a chief draftsman at Atari (where Jobs also worked).  According to Wayne himself, he was brought into the fledgling company as a more mature voice (he was 42, while Jobs and Wozniak were in their 20’s) to mediate disagreements between the other two partners:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   What must be made clear is that I was never actually involved with the soon-to-be-name computer enterprise until a modest philosophical difference arose between Jobs and Wozniak. This difference of opinion led Jobs to confide in me, and seek my advice on how to resolve the issue with his friend. After reflecting on the request, I invited both men to my apartment one evening.
  </p>
  <p>
   Apparently Jobs had been sufficiently impressed by my diplomatic performance that before the evening was over, he encouraged the three of us to form a partnership. Jobs had concluded that an ideal arrangement would be that he and Wozniak should each hold a 45% stake in the new company, and that I should retain 10% of the voting rights. Jobs felt that in the event of any future policy disputes, he could rely on my vote as the tiebreaker, and that I’d come down on the side of rationality, rather than emotion.

  As Steve Wozniak outlined in his 2005 autobiography
  <em>

  , Wayne quickly made himself valuable by drawing up the company’s initial partnership agreement, rendering the first Apple logo, and writing the operating manual for the news company’s first product, the Apple I:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   We also met with another guy from Atari, Ron Wayne, who Steve thought could be a partner. I remember meeting him for the first time and thinking, Wow, this guy is amazing. He could just sit at a typewriter and type out our whole legal partnership agreement like he’s a lawyer. He wasn’t a lawyer, but he knew all the legal words. He was a fast talker and he seemed so smart. He was one of those people who seemed to have a quick answer for everything. He seemed to know how to do all the things we didn’t.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ron ended up playing a huge role in those very early days at Apple — this was before we had funding, before we’d done much of anything. He was really the third partner, when I think of it. And he did a lot. He wrote and laid out the early operation manual. After all, he could type stuff. And he could draw. He was the one who did the etching of Newton under the Apple tree that was on the computer manual.
