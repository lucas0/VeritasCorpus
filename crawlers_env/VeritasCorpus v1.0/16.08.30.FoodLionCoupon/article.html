  In August 2016, a coupon begin to circulate on the Internet, along with the claim that the grocery chain Food Lion is offering $90 off any purchase at the store with the coupon in-hand. The grocer chain, however,
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/foodlion/posts/10154298625911352" target="_blank">
   posted
  </a>
  to their official Facebook page on 30 August 2016 that the coupon is fraudulent and they have no such offer in place:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   We are aware of the $90 Food Lion online coupon that has been circulating on Facebook. This is a fraudulent coupon that is not authorized by our company. We advise all of our fans to avoid clicking or sharing this due to the potential risks that are involved. We apologize to any customers who viewed this as a valid offer, and we are working to have this removed from Facebook as soon as possible.

  ; none are legitimate):
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Posts on Facebook offering a 50 percent off coupon to Target have started popping up in newsfeeds. Clicking on the link to “claim your Target reward” leads you through a series of websites not associated with Facebook or Target, which should draw a red flag.
