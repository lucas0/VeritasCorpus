  On 5 January 2016, President Obama announced novel executive measures intended to reduce gun violence. Predictably, his remarks met with a mixed reception, and a number of old gun control rumors began recirculating online.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among those rumors were an ancient e-mail forward commonly titled “Doctors vs. Guns” or “Fun with Statistics.” As excerpted above, the claim compares unsourced numbers of deaths attributable to doctors vs. accidental gun deaths, and concludes that Americans were 2,450 to 9,000 percent more likely to be killed by doctors than guns. The rumor and its iterations were elderly by Internet standards at the time of its 2016 circulation: our earliest online sighting of this piece dates from February

  ] included the same material, describing the information as a joke obtained from the Internet (dating it to at least 2002 and making its updated “citations” suspect):
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   John Joyce got a chuckle from every one by reading an article he had gotten off the internet, called “Sumpin’ to think about”. a. The number of physicians in the US is 700,000. b. Accidental deaths caused by Physicians per year is 120,000. c. Accidental deaths per physician are 0.171. (US Dept of health &amp; Human Services) a. The number of gun owners in the US is 80,000,000. b. The number of accidental gun deaths per year (all age groups) is 1,500. c. The number of accidental deaths per gun owner is .0000188. Statistically, doctors are approximately 9,000 times more dangerous than gun owners.

  A common aspect of early versions of this item its labeling as a

   joke
  </a>
  or funny e-mail forward, not a straightforward comparison of credible or serious statistics. That framing was underscored by the ambiguity of its quantitative units and descriptors, along with vague mentions of statistics compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). To that point, actually determining whether the numbers cited had any basis in reality was challenging, as there was no year given in which either number might have originated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Viewed through that lens, the numbers were barely worth quantifying: the basic gist was that doctors were far more likely to accidentally kill another person than a responsible gun owner. The text didn’t specify what constituted “accidental deaths caused by physicians” or details whether that figure included only clear malpractice or all deaths remotely linked to medical treatment (including folks who would have died irrespective of medical attention).

  penned a column titled “Doctors kill 2,450% more Americans than all gun-related deaths combined,” the assertions of which paralleled the claims of the original humorous e-mail:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Your doctor is FAR more likely to kill you than an armed criminal
  </p>
  <p>
   It’s true: You are 64 times more likely to be killed by your doctor than by someone else wielding a gun. That’s because 19,766 of the total 31,940 gun deaths in the USA (in the year 2011) were suicides. So the actual number of deaths from other people shooting you is only 12,174.
  </p>
  <p>
   Doctors, comparatively, kill 783,936 people each year, which is 64 times higher than 12,174. Doctors shoot you not with bullets, but with vaccines, chemotherapy and pharmaceuticals … all of which turn out to be FAR more deadly than guns.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    This is especially amazing, given that there are just under 700,000 doctors in America, while there are roughly about 80 million gun owners in America.
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   How do 700,000 doctors manage to kill 783,936 people each year (that’s over one death per doctor), while 80 million gun owners kill only 31,940? Because owning a gun is orders of magnitude safer than “practicing” medicine!

  Adams asserted the numbers reflected “over one death per doctor,” whereas the original placed that figure at 0.171. The article was accompanied by an cherry-picked infographic, which in part cited a separate
