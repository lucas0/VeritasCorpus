  </a>
  from a website named “Living Traditionally,” is still somehow classic Wolfe: a highly shareable story crafted at the expense of a beloved childhood candy through the willful misrepresentation of the science surrounding its ingredients.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  In this case, Wolfe (or whoever wrote the article) points to three chemicals which, as a matter of fact,
  <a href="http://archive.is/GJq1h" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    are present
   </span>
  </a>
  in Reese’s Peanut Butter cups:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   <em>
    Soy Lecithin
   </em>
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   Research has shown that as much as 93% of soy is genetically modified. Soy lecithin has been found to have detrimental effects on fertility and reproduction. It can cause behavioral and cerebral abnormalities. It has also been linked to breast cancer.
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   <em>
    PGPR
   </em>
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   PGPR is short for polyglycerol polyricinoleate. The manufacturer of this popular candy replaced cocoa butter with PGPR to lower the cost of production. PGPR comes from castor beans and it’s used to reduce the viscosity of chocolate. It has been connected to gastrointestinal problems and allergic reactions in children.
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   <em>
    TBHQ
   </em>
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   TBHQ stands for tertiary butylhdroquinone. It’s derived from petroleum and can be extremely toxic. Side effects of ingesting TBHQ include nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears, delirium and collapse. Research has shown that TBHQ can damage the lungs and umbilical cells in humans. It can also cause stomach cancer. Children who are exposed to this chemical may show anxiety, restlessness and intensified ADHD symptoms.

   Commercial lecithin is a naturally occurring mixture of the phosphatides [derivatives of a specific chemical] of choline, ethanolamine, and inositol, with smaller amounts of other lipids. It is isolated as a gum following hydration of solvent-extracted soy, safflower, or corn oils.

  In terms of the soy-GMO link, this issue is somewhat moot because If GMO’s aren’t a person’s jam, then that individual probably wouldn’t be purchasing Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups anyway, as the Hershey’s Company

  the possibility of GMO ingredients, broadly, in this line of products. The remaining claims are either misleading or factually impoverished.

  To support the notion that soy lecithin has “detrimental effects on fertility and reproduction”, causes “behavioral and cerebral abnormalities” and has been “linked to breast cancer”, the author of the post links to

  that looked at the effects of feeding pregnant laboratory rats and their offspring with an absurdly high soy lecithin diet. In that study, rats were given 10 grams of standardized of food per day with either 2 percent or 5 percent of the mass of that food replaced by soy lecithin. This study, which had a narrow and specific aim of investigating a proposed mechanism behind a number of neurologic conditions, found that:

  Using an over 30 year old study of pregnant and developing rats fed absurdly unrealistic doses of a chemical to say that peanut butter cups are dangerous is a reach, even by Wolfe standards. By FDA “Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS)”

  The remaining claims regarding breast cancer, fertility, and reproduction are made by conflating soy protein and soy lecithin. Soy protein is chemically similarity to estrogen, a point that has been the subject of much scientific and internet debate about its potential adverse affects. While the mechanisms linking soy to any hormone-derived maladies

 <p class="p1">
  While not hesitating to use its scary scientific name, the only allegation of note the Wolfe post makes is that PGPR has been “connected” to gastrointestinal problems and allergic reactions in children.
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">
  </span>
  Ignoring the fact that the same could be said about the ingredients in the natural version of peanut butter cups presented below Wolfe’s article, it is also a broad misrepresentation of PGPR’s risk, which is, at best, negligible.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  The most recent review of its safety, performed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and adopted on 3 March 2017,

  its safety:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   PGPR […] is not of concern with regard to genotoxicity or carcinogenicity. The single reproductive toxicity study with PGPR was limited and was not an appropriate study for deriving a health-based guidance value. Human studies with PGPR demonstrated that there is no indication of significant adverse effect.

  There have, in fact, been animal studies that report harmful effects after extremely large doses of TBHQ as well as other cases of extremely high or chronic exposure

  in a similar Wolfe debunker about the dangers of Pop Tarts, however, while the long-term health effects in humans exposed to high or chronic doses of TBQH (i.e. industrial or laboratory workers handing pure TBHQ occupationally) is not a settled issue, the long-term effects of humans exposed to it in doses legally allowed by

 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  The Wolfe post also claims that children exposed to TBHQ “may show anxiety, restlessness and intensified ADHD symptoms” despite the fact that no peer-reviewed
  <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/16043#section=Toxicity" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">

   </span>

  link TBHQ specifically to ADHD, restlessness, or anxiety.

  This notion stems from the controversial ideas of Dr.

   <span class="s1">
    Benjamin Feingold

  , who advocates the removal of myriad food additives, including TBHQ, as a cure for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and other behavioral issues. Despite his claims, however,

   <span class="s1">
    no research

  </a>
  specifically focused on TBHQ has documented any connection, and those diets he promotes generally treat a broad collection of additives as the same, despite clear chemical differences.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Ultimately, the claims presented in Wolfe’s post rely on outdated, irrelevant, or factually incomplete information. Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups do, along with many other foods, contain the listed ingredients. This point, however, is close to the only factual one made by the author of the post.
