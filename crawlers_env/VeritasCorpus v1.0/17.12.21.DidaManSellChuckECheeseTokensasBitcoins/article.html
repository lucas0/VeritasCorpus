  leveraged news about the cryptocurrency

   Bitcoin
  </a>
  spiking in value to falsely claim a man had
  <a href="https://archive.is/ekQXW" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   swindled
  </a>
  over million dollars from people by selling altered Chuck E. Cheese tokens as “Bitcoins”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Marlon Jensen, 36, was arrested a Sunday morning when NYPD stormed his home. NYPD received calls from the fraud victims that someone had sold them “Bitcoins”, only to find out there actually was no tangible bitcoin currency available. NYPD found $1.1 Million of cash inside Marlons home. According to police, Marlon had scratched off most of the Chuck E. Cheese engravements on the coins, and would write “B” on each coin with permanent marker.

  <p>
   “People are retarded haha”, said NYPD Officer Michael West, “My 8 year old son would know those weren’t bitcoins and lord knows he’s not the brightest”.

  Huzlers is a well-known purveyor of hoaxes typically based on popular topics, and as always, there was no truth to the claim. Aside from the fact that

   bitcoins
  </a>
  are not an actual form of

  currency, Chuck E. Cheese retired their usage of tokens in 2016 and
