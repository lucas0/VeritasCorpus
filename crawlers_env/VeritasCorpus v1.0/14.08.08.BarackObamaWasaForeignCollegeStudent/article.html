  One of the avenues of approach taken by “birthers” in their quest to demonstrate that Barack Obama is not eligible to hold the office of President of the United States is to try to demonstrate that, even if he was born in the United States, he gave up his
  <nobr>
   U.S. citizenship
  </nobr>
  somewhere along the
  <nobr>
   way …
  </nobr>
  and if he’s not a U.S. citizen, then he can’t legitimately be President of the United States.  Therefore, many birthers have gleefully seized onto the above-cited news report from
  <nobr>
   April 2009,
  </nobr>
  which purports that Barack Obama attended Occidental College in Los Angeles under a scholarship granted only to students of “foreign citizenship.”  However, this item isn’t a news report at all — it’s a hoax whose elements are all demonstrably false:
 </p>
 <p>
  <ul>
   <br>
    <li>
     The article is datelined “April 1, 2009” and tagged “AP,” supposedly signifying it came from the Associated Press news agency.  The date is a giveaway to the hoax (it’s April Fool’s Day), and the text of the article does not at all fit the standard Associated Press stylebook guidelines.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>
     There was no such group as “Americans for Freedom of Information” at the time this article began circulating (although someone has since
     <a href="http://amfoi.wordpress.com/2009/09/21/americans-for-freedom-of-information-website-isnt-real-either/" target="_blank">
      registered
     </a>
     a site using that domain name); in fact, a
     <nobr>

       web site

     </nobr>
     for the then-faux organization was established to poke fun at those who believed it did:

   </br>
  </ul>
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Read these tiny words very closely: the group Americans for Freedom of Information does not exist, just like the supposed “AP article” you keep cutting and pasting into
   <nobr>
    e-mails
   </nobr>
   to your irritated family does not exist, just like the “Daily Mail article” referenced in the fake “AP article” does not exist. They’re all fabrications. Fakes. Hoaxes. Ask yourself why you’re so eager to believe these obvious fakes. No, really. Really, really ask yourself.
