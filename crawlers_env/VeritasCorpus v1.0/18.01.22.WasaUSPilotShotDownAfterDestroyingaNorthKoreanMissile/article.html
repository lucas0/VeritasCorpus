   America’s Last Line of Defense

   reported

  that a United States Air Force pilot was missing in action after successfully intercepting a missile near North Korea, and that the Pentagon disavowed knowledge of the airman’s plight:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   US Air Force Captain Bob Marchand is alive but missing in action after his F-22 Raptor was shot down in what may be North Korean waters. Captain Marchand, whose call-sign is “Fricken Choad,” sent word to his wife from a fishing vessel off the coast of Pyongyang.
  </p>
  <p>
   Captain Marchand had no choice but to contact his wife after the United States military officially declined to acknowledge his existence.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  None of this was true.  America’s Last Line of Defense is part of a network of fake news sites dedicated to spreading misinformation under the guise of proffering “satire,” as the site’s page footer notes:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   sat·ire ~ˈsaˌtī(ə)r
   <br>
    noun
    <br/>
    the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, OR ridicule to expose and criticize people’s stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.
    <br/>
    If you disagree with the definition of satire or have decided it is synonymous with “comedy,” you should really just move along./blockquote&gt;
