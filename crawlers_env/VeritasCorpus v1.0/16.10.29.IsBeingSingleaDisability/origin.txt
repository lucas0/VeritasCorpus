<blockquote>
 <p>
  Single men and women without medical issues will be classed as “infertile” if they do not have children but want to become a parent, the World Health Organisation is to announce.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a move which dramatically changes the definition of infertility, WHO will declare that it should no longer be regarded as simply a medical condition.
 </p>
 <p>
  The authors of the new global standards said the revised definition gave every individual “the right to reproduce”.
 </p>
 <p>
  Under the new terms, heterosexual single men and women, and gay men and  women who want to have children would be given the same priority as couples seeking IVF because of medical fertility problems.
