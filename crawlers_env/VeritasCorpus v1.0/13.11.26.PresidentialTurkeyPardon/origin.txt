  The Truman Library has received many requests over the years for information confirming the story that President Truman “pardoned” a Thanksgiving turkey in 1947, thus initiating a Presidential tradition that continues to this day.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Library’s staff has found no documents, speeches, newspaper clippings, photographs, or other contemporary records in our holdings which refer to Truman pardoning a turkey that he received as a gift in 1947, or at any other time during his Presidency. Truman sometimes indicated to reporters that the turkeys he received were destined for the family dinner table.
