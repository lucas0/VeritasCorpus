  Since at least 2014, one of the Internet’s most viral scientific images has been an animated gif showing a protein with “legs” strutting along a filament while carrying a large undulating orb. Viral posts originating on

    This is what happiness really looks like: Molecules of the protein myosin drag a ball of endorphins along an active filament into the inner part of the brain's parietal cortex, which produces feelings of happiness.

  , Lieber explained that he originally created the animation as a side project, but that it ended up being a big part of the final short film:

   The kinesin motor protein was a real scene stealer in

   , although it wasn’t even in the original treatment for the short. The original plan was to omit the motor protein in the vesicle shots, but when I saw [another researcher’s animation of the molecule] I secretly went ahead and modeled one of my own, animated a walk cycle for it, and added it into the vesicle shot. After I showed it to [one of the Harvard collaborators] it not only got into the animation, it got several more shots as well.

  Both kinesin and myosin are considered motor proteins, which (among other things) can transport newly synthesized molecules between different regions within eukaryotic cells, as described in a

 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   The motions of muscles as well as much smaller intracellular cargoes are driven by molecular motors that move unidirectionally along protein polymers (actin or microtubules). […] Muscle myosin, whose study dates back to 1864, has served as a model system for understanding motility for decades. Kinesin, discovered […] in 1985, is a relative newcomer by comparison.

  have a similar molecular core and both use ATP to power their movement, it is the iconic strut that gives away the identity of the motor protein in the viral animation.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Both myosin and kinesin have identical pairs of molecules that “latch” onto different types of cellular structures. In kinesin they move over

   <span class="s1">

  distances with coordinated steps. In myosin, which is most famous for the processes that drive muscle contractions, those latching molecules operate independently of each other, and the system produces more of a single tug than a coordinated strut.

 <p class="p1">
  While scientists have not produced actual images or videos of such molecules with the clarity of this visualization, increasingly precise microscopic techniques and tools have allowed a detailed characterizations and direct observations of their movement. A groundbreaking

  While some posts assert that this animation represents an action that takes place in the brain, the creator says that it — and the larger video it is part of — actually “takes the viewer through many of the inner workings of a leukocyte (or white blood cell) showing many of the cellular structures and organelles along the way.” While kinesins

  in transporting numerous important chemicals within neurons, that is not a process that would be happening in a white blood cell.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Because this picture shows an artist’s visualization of a kinesin protein in a white blood cell and not a myosin protein in a neuron, and it is not an actual video but a representation, we rate the claim that this picture is a visual representation of “happiness” as false.
