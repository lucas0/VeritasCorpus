  So today we went swimming like normal, my daughter was wearing her puddle jumper but fast forward til 9:30pm and she was saying she couldn’t breath and her chest and ribs were hurting! So we rush to the ER all I could think was dry drowning and was frantic but she actually has Severe bruising on her rib! (And also has to be supervised for the next few days very closely) You wanna know from what PUDDLE JUMPERS!! And she isn’t the first case! The doctor told me these are not very safe they put lots of pressure on their small chest cavities so I want to warn all of the parents out there! The doctor recommends a full life jacket or single arm floaters because they do not put pressure on a certain area of the chest! The picture is what kind she was wearing and the kind they strongly do not recommend because they can easily put strain on their small chest!
