   One of the eyewitnesses, brother of the deceased, told reporters: “I have no idea why they would do something like this. I have absolutely no idea. I am in shock myself.” He said he last talked to his brother 2 hours ago.

   Police tells CBC that one of the guns used in the shootings was legally purchased and traces back to someone believe to be connect with the shootings. The police would not disclose the name of the purchaser.

   One of the suspects involved in the Peterborough shootings has been identified but the name is undisclosed. He abruptly left the crime scene after the shootings.

   The sources said one of the residences in Peterborough, surrounded by law enforcement is connected to the suspect. It is that house where the chase began that led to the shootout with the occupants of the SUV.
