  Someone shared a map on facebook, saying that laws in 35 states allow police officers to rape detainees and get away from it, like a rape loophole?

  I recently read article linked below and was wondering if the claim that there are no laws to prevent cops from having sex with a detainee in 35 states. Also I was under the impression that inmates in prison could not consent to sexual contact with a guard or other authority figure, is that true?

   There are currently 35 states in which police officers can rape women in police custody and not be prosecuted and convicted of a felony. This is 2018. Our policing system is not broken, it is flawed by design.
