  “The Morton County Sheriff’s Department has been using Facebook check-ins to find out who is at Standing Rock in order to target them in attempts to disrupt the prayer camps. SO Water Protectors are calling on EVERYONE to check-in at Standing Rock, ND to overwhelm and confuse them. This is concrete action that can protect people putting their bodies and well-beings on the line that we can do without leaving our homes. Will you join me in Standing Rock?

  If you’re sharing your location at Standing Stock:
  <br>
   1) Make it public.
   <br/>
   2) Make the clarification post SEPARATE, and limit post visibility to your friends only.
   <br/>
   3) Don’t clarify on your check-in post; privately message friends who say “stay safe!” to let them know what’s up.
   <br/>
   4) Copy/paste to share clarification messages (like this one) because making it public blows our cover.
   <br/>
   5) Use an alternate name in clarification posts so that when they filter out / search those terms, your post is visible to the right people.”
