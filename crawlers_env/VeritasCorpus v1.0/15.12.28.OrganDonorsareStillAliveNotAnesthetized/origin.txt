  All scientific knowledge comes from a process of trial and error – a messy guessing game, that involves many false starts and much stumbling. Scientists first make an educated guess based on their observations … Much Scientific Theory is nothing more, than Scientific consensus in the collective opinion of the community of scientists in a particular field of study. There is no requirement for consensus. Scientific truth, or any other truth can’t be achieved by consensus.

  Many people automatically confuse Science and Technology with progress. Progress serves and benefits humanity, which science and technology not always do.

  The popular myth is that science and scientists are objective and neutral, but funding usually comes from the federal government or from industry. Rarely is this about “pure” science. There are objectives. The public welfare is far down the list as a consideration.
