  Most gun owners are responsible and law-abiding, and they use their guns safely. The President strongly believes that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms. But to better protect our children and our communities from tragic mass shootings like those in Newtown, Aurora, Oak Creek, and Tucson, there are common-sense steps we can take right now.

  <strong>
   While no law or set of laws will end gun violence
  </strong>
  , it is clear that the American people want action. If even one childâ€™s life can be saved, then we need to act. Now is the time to do the right thing for our children, our communities, and the country we love.
