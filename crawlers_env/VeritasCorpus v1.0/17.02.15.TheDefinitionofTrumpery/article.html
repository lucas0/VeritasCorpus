 </h3>
 <p>
  It is now common knowledge (hat tip to the Internet) that President Donald Trump’s ancestral family name was
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/donald-drumpf/" target="_blank">
   Drumpf
  </a>
  , a presumably respectable German surname that sounds, unfortunately — to English speakers’ ears, at any rate — like a sack of potatoes hitting the bed of a donkey cart.
 </p>
 <p>
  At some point (a century, or two, or perhaps three ago; the exact timing of it remains unclear), a forebear shortened the family name to Trump: “a good move,” Donald Trump

   noted
  </a>
  in 2004, “since Drumpf Tower doesn’t sound nearly as catchy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  During the early months of Trump’s presidential campaign in 2015, naysayers deployed
  <em>
   Drumpf
  </em>
  to great effect as a put-down, sometimes even alleging (falsely) that Drumpf, not Trump, was the candidate’s real name.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was around the same time that Trump antagonists caught on to another peculiarity of the President-to-be’s surname, which is that it can be passed off as the root of the English noun
  <em>
   <a href="https://wordsmith.org/words/trumpery.html" target="_blank">
    trumpery
   </a>
  </em>
  , which has been in use since the 1400s and is rife with derogatory connotations. You can imagine these people’s delight to discover, for example, that the current edition of
  <em>
   Merriam-Webster
  </em>
  <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trumpery" target="_blank">
   defines
  </a>
  <em>
   trumpery
  </em>
  as “worthless nonsense,” or a collection of “trivial but useless articles.” And that’s just for starters.
