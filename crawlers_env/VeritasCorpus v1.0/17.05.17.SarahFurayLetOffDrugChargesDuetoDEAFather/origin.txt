  At the age of 19, you are an adult. You can be charged as an adult if you commit a crime – right? Well, not always, sometimes, it just depends on who your dad is. Sarah Furay was arrested when Texas authorities found methamphetamine, ecstasy, cocaine, and marijuana in her apartment.

  Furay also had packaging material, two digital scales, and a drug price list in her bedroom. She was charged with one count of possession and three counts of manufacturing and delivery of controlled substances; her bail was set at $39,000.

  After having spent just one day in jail, Furay was released. Turns out that this young woman’s father is Bill Furay – a DEA agent who has been working with that agency since 2008.
