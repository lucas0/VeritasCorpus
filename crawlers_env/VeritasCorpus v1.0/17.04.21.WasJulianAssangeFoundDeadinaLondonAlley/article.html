  On 13 April 2017, the web site Daily Info Box
  <a href="https://archive.is/E6N8c" target="_blank">
   reported
  </a>
  that Wikileaks founder Julian Assange had been found dead in a London alley, his body showing signs of torture:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   After being kidnapped from the Ecuadorian embassy in the early morning hours, Julian Assange’s body was found tossed away like garbage in a London alley. Investigators from Scotland Yard are currently working with MI5 and the United States FBI to figure out exactly what transpired here today.
  </p>
  <p>
   Obviously, Assange has many enemies, none who would want to see him dead than Hillary Clinton. According to Chief Investigator Nigel Hollister, Assange wasn’t simply kidnapped and killed; he endured what looks like hours of advanced interrogation techniques. His finger and toenails had been removed and his testicles were crushed with what may have been a small sledgehammer.
