  at her and smiling and constantly on and off his phone. Security guards were in the corner watching him. Eventually he got on his phone and suddenly stood up and walked all the way to the other side of the food court through the tables and looped back to continue on towards the center of the mall. The security guards watched him the whole time and then as he was speed walking out of the food court they followed him. Not sure how long he was there and what happened to get the guards attention but this shit is real and you must keep your eyes peeled for situations like this. To odd not to share with my fellow TC locals and honestly Anyone who reads this.
