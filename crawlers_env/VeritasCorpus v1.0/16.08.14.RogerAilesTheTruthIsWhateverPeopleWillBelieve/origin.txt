  I feel it’s important to point out that “news” is the conveying of factual, provable information. Opinion (or editorial) is a writer’s opinion or personal perception of a fact.

  Fox News, for example, even though it’s called “Fox News,” is mostly opinion. Roger Ailes, Fox News President, said, in a 1984 book, “The truth is whatever people will believe.” This means that this widely-respected “news” organization feels it’s perfectly acceptable to bend the truth to meet its needs.
