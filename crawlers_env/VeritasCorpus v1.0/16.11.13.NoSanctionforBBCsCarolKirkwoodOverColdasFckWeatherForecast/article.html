  On 16 January 2016, the News Thump  web site published an article reporting claiming that BBC presenter
  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/2jFbVcst3YNT4DTxBqRnrF4/carol-kirkwood" target="_blank">
   Carol Kirkwood
  </a>
  had described the weather as “cold as f*ck” during a live broadcast:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The BBC has announced that there will be no punishment for popular weather presenter Carol Kirkwood’s use of the phrase ‘cold as f*ck.’
  </p>
  <p>
   She used the phrase during an outside broadcast on a hill in the North York Moors on Friday morning in response to a question from colleague Bill Turnbill.
  </p>
  <p>
   “And now to Carol for the weather,” said the avuncular bee-keeper.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Carol, it looks a bit chilly where you are?”
  </p>
  <p>
   “That’s right Billy,” she responded chirpily.
  </p>
  <p>
   “It’s cold as fuck.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “I’m sorry?” replied a visibly shocked Turnbill.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Cold. As. Fuck.” She repeated, forcefully.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Bastard cold. Shitting cold. Cold as an eskimo’s arse. Cold as a witch’s tit. Cold enough to worry any brass monkeys. It is abso-fucking-lutely fucking cold as fucking fuck.”
  </p>
  <p>
   The BBC has issued a statement saying there would be no sanction for Miss Kirkwood because “after investigation we have discovered that on the North York Moors on Friday morning, it was indeed cold as f*ck.”

  There was no truth to this story. As noted in their disclaimer, News Thump is a satirical web site:

  Kirkwood caught wind of the story shortly after it was published and maintained she definitely didn’t say “that” during the broadcast:
