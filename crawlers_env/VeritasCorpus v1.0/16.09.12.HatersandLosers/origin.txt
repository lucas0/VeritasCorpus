  Two years ago, Donald Trump’s Twitter account sent a public message out to the world to “even the haters and losers” — on September 11, the twelve-year anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.
 </p>
 <p>
  Trump’s tweet read: “I would like to extend my best wishes to all, even the haters and losers, on this special date, September 11th.”

 <p>
  But with Trump currently leading the pack of Republican presidential candidates, the original tweet from the morning of September 11, 2013 vanished from his account.
