   warnings

  began circulating in Collin County, Texas about purported “serial kidnappings” that were occurring at local Target and Walmart locations. According to one version of the rumor, the kidnappers first photographed child victims before then loading them into vehicles and shipping them off to other countries:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   there has been a serial kidnapping at walmarts and targets in Collin county. These people are taking pictures of your kids and then having a vehicle pull up and kidnap them, then send them to another country.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  In May 2015, a Facebook user caused a stir with a subsequently viral claim of kidnappers in an Oklahoma
