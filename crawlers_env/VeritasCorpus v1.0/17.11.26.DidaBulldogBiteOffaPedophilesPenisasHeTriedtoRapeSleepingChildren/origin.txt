 <p>
  A pedophile has been left with “life-altering” injuries after climbing through the bedroom window of two young children, only to be greeted by their pet bulldog who bit his penis off.
 </p>
 <p>
  52-year-old Randle James of Saline County, Arkansas, climbed into the 1st-floor window of the small family home into the room where the two young sisters were sleeping after passing by and seeing the open window.
 </p>
 <p>
  After climbing into the room of the 3 and 6-year-old sisters, James got more than he bargained for when family’s Pitt Pull Terrier leaped to the girl’s defense.
 </p>
 <p>
  The dog severed the rapist’s genitals clean off and swallowed his penis and testicles.
