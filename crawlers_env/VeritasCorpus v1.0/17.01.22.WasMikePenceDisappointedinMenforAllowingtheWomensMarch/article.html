   Admonishing those responsible for failing to uphold their moral duties, Vice President Mike Pence expressed disappointment in the 200,000 husbands and fathers who had allowed the women and girls in their charge to attend the Women’s March on Washington. “I can’t tell you how let down I feel by the heads of these households who did not simply give their wives and daughters a firm, decisive ‘no’ when they asked to participate in today’s demonstration,” said Pence, noting with frustration that many of the protesters had been granted permission to travel across the country alone and stay for several days in a faraway city with no male chaperone whatsoever to guide and look after them.

  As of this writing, Vice President Pence has not publicly issued comment on the Women’s March protest. President Trump did, however, reference it on Twitter:

   Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn’t these people vote? Celebs hurt cause badly.
