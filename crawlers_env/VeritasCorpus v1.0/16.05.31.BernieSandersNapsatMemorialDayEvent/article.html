  The man featured in the above-displayed photograph is indeed Bernie Sanders, but there is little evidence (other than his slouched pose) to prove that he was sleeping during the event Dunning only provided a single photograph, making it difficult to determine if Sanders briefly nodded off during the ceremony, momentarily lowered his head and closed his eyes to fight off a bout of fatigue or pain, was
