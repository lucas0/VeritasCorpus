  [Gymnastics] wasn’t traditionally a sport the U.S. dominated. The American women didn’t win their first team gold until 1996. But they have now captured the team title at the last two Olympics, and American women have won the individual all-around at the last four Summer Games.

 <p>
  It’s fitting that the current team has nicknamed itself the “Final Five,” a tribute to leader Marta Karolyi, 73, who is stepping down after the Rio Games. She and her husband, Bela, have been towering figures in the world of gymnastics since the 1970s.

 <p>
  They first rose to prominence in their native Romania where they trained the country’s first wave of superstar gymnasts, including Nadia Comaneci, who scored the sport’s first perfect 10 and took gold at the 1976 Olympics.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Karolyis defected to the U.S. in 1981 and have helped transform the American women into the world’s best.
