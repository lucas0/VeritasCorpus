  As ObamaSnippetsDotCom evolves, I thought I’d try a slightly different format for this new video. In the past, I have tried to hide my edits to some degree, in order to make the videos look somewhat real. This was not an attempt to deceive, but rather just another layer of creativity. But, upon further reflection, it would seem that hiding my edits just isn’t fair to the slower folks out there.

  I have grown weary of reading comments from “video experts” who have “concluded” that the video “has been doctored,” “is fake,” or worse, “a hoax.” All I wanted to do is create videos that were funny, or at least clever. I have made it abundantly clear on my Channel Profile that these are spoofs. But clearly, some people just don’t get it.

  My contribution to the YouTube community is my ability to take a given video, chop, slice, dice and splice it, and create a totally different, hopefully funny video. So, at least for this video, my edits will not be hidden, but rather will be proudly on display for all to see and admire.

  Hopefully, this will help eliminate the controversial aspect of my videos, and will help highlight the humorous aspect, as was originally intended.
