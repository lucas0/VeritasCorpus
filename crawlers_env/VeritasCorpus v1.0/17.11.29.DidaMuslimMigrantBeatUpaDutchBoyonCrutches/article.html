  On 29 November 2017, United States President Donald Trump retweeted three videos from

  , it wasn‚Äôt surprising that at least one of these videos, which purportedly shows violent acts committed by Muslims, had a misleading caption :

  Although the video is frequently accompanied by the caption ‚ÄúMuslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches,‚Äù there is no evidence to support this assertion, which in fact came, like so many other unfortunate assumptions, from its comment section.
 </p>
 <p>
  This video was first posted to the web site
  <a href="http://www.dumpert.nl/mediabase/7132141/e9bfd7a3/boosmakertje_du_jour.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   Dumpert.nl
  </a>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  a popular video portal in the Netherlands,
  <em>
  </em>
  in May 2017.¬†Although the original posting largely focuses on the act of hitting a person on crutches, and it was not shared with any claims about the attacker‚Äôs religion, some people on the comment section naturally¬†‚Äî and baselessly ‚Äî assumed that the perpetrator was Muslim. As the video was
  <a href="https://archive.is/eqpDN" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   reposted
  </a>
  to other web sites, the unfounded claim that the attacker was a Muslim migrant followed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shortly after this video was posted to¬†Dumpert.nl
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  Dutch police officers were able to locate the attacker and arrest him. A news
  <a href="https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/165095/aanhoudingen-dankzij-filmpje-dumpert" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   report
  </a>
  from the
  <em>
   Telegraaf
  </em>
  identified him as a 16-year-old boy from Monnickendam. The report made no mention of the boy‚Äôs religion.

  The Netherlands Embassy in the United States also took to Twitter to tell to President Trump that ‚Äúfacts do matter‚Äù and that the attacker in the video was not a Muslim migrant:

   Facts do matter. The perpetrator of the violent act in this video was born and raised in the Netherlands. He received and completed his sentence under Dutch law.
