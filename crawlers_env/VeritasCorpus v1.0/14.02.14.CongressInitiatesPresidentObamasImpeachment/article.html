  A large number of articles falsely declaring that Congress has started impeachment proceedings against President Obama have circulated widely on the Internet since Barack Obama took office in January 2009, most of them
  <a href="impeachment.asp" target="imp">
   spoofs
  </a>
  from well known fake news web site.  A similar item from February 2014 (quoted above) is not a spoof, but it’s just as false.
 </p>
 <p>
  In December 2013, Representative Tom Rice of South Carolina introduced
  <nobr>
   <a href="http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th/house-resolution/442" target="_blank">
    H.Res. 442
   </a>
  </nobr>
  , also known as the STOP (Stop This Overreaching Presidency) resolution, to Congress.  That resolution was not, as claimed above, one which initiated impeachment proceedings against President Obama, nor did it state that the President “should be impeached.”
  <nobr>
   Rep. Rice’s
  </nobr>
  <a href="http://rice.house.gov/stop-act" target="_blank">
   STOP resolution
  </a>
  was a non-binding one (essentially an expression of opinion with no legal force behind it)
  <a href="https://rice.house.gov/sites/rice.house.gov/files/wysiwyg_uploaded/STOP_leg_text.pdf" target="_blank">
   declaring
  </a>
  that Congress should file a lawsuit against President Obama in
  <nobr>
   U.S. District
  </nobr>
  Court in order to challenge various actions he has undertaken via executive order:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A group of House Republicans is pushing a resolution to bring legal action against President Barack Obama for overstepping his authority in executive orders.
  </p>
  <p>
   The STOP (Stop This Overreaching Presidency) resolution, sponsored by
   <nobr>
    Rep. Tom
   </nobr>
   Rice, targets Obama for allowing a year extension health care policies that were ended because of Obamacare; delaying the employer mandate for one year; deferring the deportation of illegal immigrants brought to the country as children and waiving part of the welfare work requirement.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rice said he’s spoken with the House GOP leadership about the resolution — which would be
   <nobr>
    non-binding
   </nobr>
   if it ever advanced, and wouldn’t need Senate approval — and a hearing is being scheduled in both the Judiciary and Administration Committees.
  </p>
  <p>
   The resolution has 74 Republican cosponsors, ranging from the more conservative to moderate members. Rice held a press conference to announce it with
   <nobr>
    12 other
   </nobr>
   Republicans.
