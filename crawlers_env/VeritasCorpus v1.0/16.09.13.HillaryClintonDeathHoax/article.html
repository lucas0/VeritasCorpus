  On 12 September 2016, convicted felon Hal Turner’s disreputable, conspiracy-flogging web site SuperStation95
  <a href="http://archive.is/ToSIo/image" target="_blank">
   reported
  </a>
  that New York City television station WABC had announced the death of Hillary Clinton the previous evening, after the Democratic presidential nominee left a 9/11 anniversary memorial ceremony in New York prematurely earlier in the day due to health reasons (later attributed to
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2016/09/11/hillary-clinton-medical-episode/" target="pn">
   pneumonia
  </a>
  ).  SuperStation95 also maintained that a Hillary Clinton “body double,” and not Clinton herself, had been spotted in New York a few hours after the candidate’s abrupt departure from the 9/11 ceremony:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A video clip of WABC-TV Channel 7 “Eyewitness News” in New York City opened last night with Anchorman Joe Torre saying “more on Hillary Clinton’s Death.” The opening line, however, seems edited-OUT of the video archive!
  </p>
  <p>
   Did Hillary die after leaving the 9-11 Ceremony in New York … and the information is being concealed? A whole slew of irregularities have cropped-up indicating that may actually be the case!
  </p>
  <p>
   Here is the video segment from the 11:00 PM “Eyewitness News” broadcast of September 11, 2016 in which Anchorman Joe Torre seems to say Hillary Clinton is DEAD:

   <strong>
    BODY DOUBLE?
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   A short time later, a person ALLEGED to be Hillary, is seen leaving the East 26th Street home of Chelsea Clinton,  but there are problems with this person.
  </p>
  <p>
   First, the person who was allegedly Hillary Clinton, looked about thirty pounds lighter in body weight than the Hillary who was at the 9-11 ceremony!   Here’s the video of “Hillary” leaving Chelsea Clinton’s home on East 26th Street:

   Notice the body weight?  Clearly, this person is significantly thinner than Hillary appeared just two hours earlier at the 9-11 memorial ceremony.  Moreover, the gait of this person is dramatically different than the gait of Hillary Clinton seen just two hours earlier.  It’s almost as though this “Hillary” is ten years younger, with a strong, assured stride, versus the slower, meandering walk usually displayed by the real Hillary.

  in a separate article the claim that the woman referenced above was Hillary Clinton impressionist (not “body double”) Teresa Barnwell, who could not possibly be confused for Hillary Clinton by anyone who saw her up close due the two women’s clear facial dissimilarities:

  The suggestion that Hillary Clinton died, with her death being announced by WABC-TV during their 11 PM news broadcast on 11 September 2016 — who then excised that report from their video archive to conceal the truth — is also untrue. WABC anchorman Joe Torres simply misread a word during the introduction to a segment about Hillary Clinton; the station did not actually report her death (as was evident to anyone who actually watched the broadcast), nor does WABC provide an online archive of their news broadcasts from which this element could have been “edited out”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   During a live introduction to a story about the health of Hillary Clinton, Joe Torres inadvertently said ‘death’ when he meant to say ‘health.’  It was clear from the context of the story, the reporters’ information, and graphics on the screen that Secretary Clinton was alive and recovering.”
