 <p>
  Four brothers and their cousins from Limpopo have been arrested after they captured a crocodile which had been eating their livestock and allegedly gang-raped it for days.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reports are that the farmers(names withheld pending full investigations) who were gatvol with the crocodile which was eating their goats on a daily basis, set a trap and captured the reptile alive.
 </p>
 <p>
  They then took the crocodile to their compound where they took turns to se_xually abuse the poor animal-believed to be a female- for days on end in one of their huts.
 </p>
 <p>
  The brothers were exposed after Department of Parks and Wildlife launched an investigation after a tip-off from an anonymous whistle-blower.
