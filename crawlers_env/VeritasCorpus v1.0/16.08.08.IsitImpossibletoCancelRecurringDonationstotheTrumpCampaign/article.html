  shared a screenshot via Twitter of an e-mail sent by a frustrated former Trump supporter, claiming that it was impossible for backers to cancel recurring donations to the Trump campaign:

  Diamond’s tweet sparked a number of articles and blog posts stating it was “impossible” to cancel recurring Trump campaign donations, based solely or primarily on the anecdotal, secondhand claim made  in that tweet. Among the comments prompted by original tweet sent by Diamond were those left by other purported donors asserting that the claim wasn’t exactly accurate:

  A large number of commenters expressed skepticism about the report, given that the claim was anonymously  sourced from a single individual:

   Cheap shot: we all know you can contact your bank or other form of payment you use, to cancel right away.

  We were unable to turn up any reports about the issue that antedated Diamond’s tweet. If any Trump donors had previously encountered difficulties canceling their recurring donations, they didn’t seem to chatter very much about it on social media prior to 3 August 2016 (and ceasing to support Trump as a candidate is only one reason someone might seek to cancel a recurring payment). Diamond appeared to pass the baton on the story overall, updating followers later with a link to an article published by
  <em>
   Mic
  </em>
  :

  Diamond did not provide any further information about the claim, the claimant, or how he verified it before sharing it to Twitter. But
  <em>
   Mic
  </em>
  attempted to reproduce the problem on 4 August 2016 and gathered more information on the difficulty level of canceling recurring Trump donations. In a series of screenshots the site illustrated their findings, stating it was not possible to delete a stored credit card without replacing it with a separate valid credit card:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   After investigating, Mic can confirm that there is no easy option to stop recurring donations on Trump’s donation site: We set up a recurring donation of $1 and found no button or other obvious way to cancel payments or remove a credit card from the system — either on the homepage, the “update card” page, or in your contribution confirmation email. Once you’re registered, if you try to change your payment information on Trump’s site, you will see no option to remove your credit card — only “update” it. Then, when you click on “update card,” you see a page that allows you to alter your payment information — but you cannot completely delete your credit card. You are forced to replace it with another valid card: Invalid numbers are rejected.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  One responder to the original tweet then objected to that claim, stating it was impossible to set up a recurring $1 donation:
 </p>
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en">
  <p>
   .
   <a href="https://twitter.com/JDiamond1" target="_blank">
    @JDiamond1
   </a>
   You can’t set up a $1.00 recurring amt.

    What else about this story is BS?
