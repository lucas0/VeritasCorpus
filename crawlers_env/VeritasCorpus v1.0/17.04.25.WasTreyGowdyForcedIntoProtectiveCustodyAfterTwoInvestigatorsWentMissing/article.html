 <p>
  In April 2017, the entertainment web site
  <em>
   The Last Line of Defense
  </em>
  published a series of false articles concerning U.S. Representative Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), a criminal investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and multiple mysterious deaths.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gowdy is the
  <a href="http://benghazi.house.gov/" target="_blank">
   chairman
  </a>
  of the Select Committee on Benghazi, and squared off against Clinton in 2016 during an eight-hour hearing on the attack on a U.S. consulate and a CIA compound in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012, when Clinton was Secretary of State. The attacks have sparked multiple conspiracy theories.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/clinton-mcgill-found-dead/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   inventing
  </a>
  a story claiming that a former Clinton assistant was found dead shortly before he was to testify about Benghazi,
  <em>
   The Last Line of Defense
  </em>
  has also published at least two other fake news articles on the topic. One claimed that two of Trey Gowdy’s
  <a href="https://archive.is/KSEEh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   investigators
  </a>
  were found dead in Arkansas, while a second claimed that
  <a href="https://archive.is/ZN0jW" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   Gowdy
  </a>
  had been forced into hiding.
 </p>
 <p>
  All of these stories are fictional.

  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2016/01/14/fake-news-sites/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   fake news
  </a>
  . The web site, which has a long
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/tag/the-last-line-of-defense/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   history
  </a>
  of publishing misinformation, carries a

  labeling its content as satirical:

 <p>
  In addition to their publication on a fake news site, there were several other ways to deduce that these items were false. The article claiming that two of Gowdy’s investigators were found dead in Arkansas included two images from an unrelated event:

 </p>
 <p>
  The rumor that Gowdy was “forced into protective custody” also doesn’t hold up in light of the politician’s recent appearances. On 24 April 2017, for instance, Gowdy delivered a
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLIPiFT0X9U" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   speech
  </a>
  at South Carolina’s
  <a href="http://www.converse.edu/sights-sounds-inauguration-day-part-1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

  , something that would surely be impossible if Gowdy was in protective custody.
