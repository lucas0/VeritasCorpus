  A man by the name of Yannie Znayew claims he has started the Fort McMurray Fire.

  Below you can see the comments he’s made on the website called therebel.media, which is a right wing news publishing website.

   In a previous comment the man also states he knows about ISIS. And could possibly be connected to ISIS.

  Truly shocking. The report comes from this website.

   Ha! With a few more matches, maybe me and the rest of my NDP socialist buddies can bring the tar sands industry to its knees. At least we managed to turn the Wildrose leader into a homeless bum. As far as the rest of you gravy sucking pigs are concerned, SUCK ON YOUR ASHES!

  Enjoy your little trip, Levant. There’s no way to contain the bloodlust of ISIS; I could have told you that without setting foot in France. Even with processing a single refugee, Canada is swarming with ISIS underlings ready to serve at the drop of a grenade. No one is safe , but I’m sure they’ll take additional pleasure eviscerating those reactionaries who continue to beak off on this site. The Caliphate of Canada is right around the corner and there’s nothing anyone can do about it.

  This could be just some fake name making up comments on the rebel to get his fame, we sure hope he gets his fame, we cannot confirm if it’s real person or not, we can only go by his comments.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wether this is a troll post or not, this person must be investigated.
