The item quoted above began circulating on the Internet in November 2000. One hardly knows what to make of backfence gossip so inelegantly crafted that its unintentional humor is as striking as what we're supposed to be hopping mad about.  The piece is worth a read if only for its <NOBR>"... the</NOBR> Secret Service which has statuary responsibility to protect the First Family" line. (What, the Secret Service has to stand really, really still? Or are lantern-jawed agents charged with running about gardens to shoo away diarrheal pigeons?)

All humor aside, this is a blood-boiler, full of sound and fury but signifying nothing.  It's gossip, plain and simple; a dirty little story dumped onto the Internet to further discredit a President and First Lady some don't like.

The Secret Service is notorious for its reluctance to discuss even mundane aspects of how it carries out its duties, so authoritative information about the setup of the Clinton home in New York state is hard to come by.

 <p>
  In September 1999, just before President Bill Clinton’s last full year in office, the First Couple purchased a
  <nobr>
   $1.7 million,
  </nobr>
  <nobr>
   11-room
  </nobr>
  Dutch Colonial home in in Chappaqua, New York, located in the wooded suburbs of Westchester County.  Around the time of that purchase, the press estimated that a permanent, taxpayer-funded security system worth more than
  <nobr>
   $1 million
  </nobr>
  would have to be installed to adequately protect the President.  This circumstance eventually led to rumors that the Clintons were charging “rent” to the federal agents assigned to protect their home (and eventually themselves):
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Just in case your blood pressure wasn’t up
   <nobr>
    enough …
   </nobr>
  </p>
  <p>
   As you know, the Clintons had to establish residence in New York for Hillary to run for the Senate.  So they bought that big house-BUT there was no place for Secret Service which has statuary responsibility to protect the First Family.
  </p>
  <p>
   So, a special ‘safe area’ was built.
  </p>
  <p>
   NOW, the Clintons are charging them rent! It just happens that their rent is about same amount as their mortgage payment!
  </p>
  <p>
   In short, we taxpayers pay for the Secret Service addition, AND the Clinton’s mortgage! Such a deal, eh? What will it take for the American public to wake up?
  </p>
  <p>
   Don’t you just feel like you’ve been suckered again, fellow taxpayers?
  </p>
  <p>
   I say let’s pass this info throughout the length and breadth of this Nation to shake the American people into a heightened state of anger upon knowing they have been literally raped during their long sleep by no other than those trustees they have appointed to look after their interests …

  Security measures of this level are not specific to the Clintons; the homes of all Presidents are treated this way, as (to a lesser extent) are the homes of former presidents. (In 1981, for example, the Secret Service spent several months providing round-the-clock protection, at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars per day, for an
  <u>
   empty
  </u>
  Pacific Palisades, California, home owned by Ronald and Nancy Reagan, even though the Reagans no longer lived in or used the house, and even though it was vacant and up for sale.)
 </p>
 <p>
  The costs of installation and maintenance for security systems at the properties of current and former presidents comes from public funds, because the protection of first families is viewed as a right and proper charge upon the nation.  The Secret Service does not divulge the costs of its protective details, but it’s believed to be in the range of tens of millions of dollars a year for each former president.

One might fleetingly think that perhaps agents are being housed at the Chappaqua home, thus providing at least some small justification for this rent story. Yet that is not the case.  Agents work out of permanent <A HREF="http://www.treas.gov/usss/field_offices.htm"

(The Service does more than guard important figures; it also investigates bank and credit card fraud, counterfeiting, and telecommunications and computer crime.)  Personnel assigned to field offices live locally. They work ordinary shifts and go home to their families when their day is done; they do not camp out with the people they're protecting.

  The Clintons’ home in Chappaqua is served by the White Plains office of the Secret Service, which was already well-staffed before the Clintons’ home purchase (largely because many consulates maintain houses in the area).  The arrival of the First Family shifted the office’s workload from 90% investigative and 10% protective to 80% protective and 20% investigative. The office was there before the Clintons bought into the neighborhood, and it will continue to be there even if the Clintons sell the house.

In December 2000, the Clintons took possession of another house, this one a <NOBR>$2.85 million</NOBR> home in Washington, D.C., a stone's throw from famed Embassy Row. Though White House press releases refer to the Clintons as "residents of Chappaqua, New York" and emphasize the house is "for <NOBR>Mrs. Clinton's</NOBR> use while the Senate is in session," security renovations will have to be made to this house as well even if only the former First Lady uses the place. (Former Presidents can get $200,000 in security improvements at a second home, and more with Congressional approval, which usually is just a formality.)

  In 1994 Congress changed the rules governing protection of former Presidents, limiting future
  <nobr>
   ex-Chief
  </nobr>
  Executives to only ten years’ worth of protection after they leave office (with the exemption of then-President Bill Clinton).   However, that rules change was
  <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-restores-lifetime-secret-service-for-former-presidents/" target="_blank">
   overturned
  </a>
  in 2013 by a measure that restored Secret Service protection to all former U.S. presidents and first ladies throughout their lifetimes, as well as for the children of former presidents until they are 16 years old.  (Former presidents and first ladies are free to relinquish this Secret Service protection, as Richard Nixon did in 1985.)

  The Clintons have always been subject to rumors of the “Slick Willy” variety; that is, ones which play upon a recurrent theme of their taking advantage of loopholes and benefits they’ve a legal, but not moral, right to. In the world of popular lore, they are often perceived as candy grabbers, greedy little children set loose in an enormous sweets shop funded by the taxpayer. This rumor is another of this kind, an expression of widely-held public opinion. It’s gossip, but it’s what the public is thinking, set down in the form of a story.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a kernel of truth underlying the gossip here, but that kernel has been so distorted that it hardly qualifies as the truth any more.  As Lloyd Grove reported in the
  <i>
   Washington Post
  </i>
  :
 </p>
 <p>
  <ul type="Disc">
   <br>
    <li>
     It is a standard arrangement that the Secret Service provide payment to homeowners for space used by the agency in such situations.  The Clintons did not take it upon themselves to “charge the Secret Service rent.”
    </li>
   </br>
  </ul>
 </p>
 <p>
  <li>
   The amount provided is based on a government formula, not set by the homeowner, and in the Clintons’ case this amount was $1,100.  (Note that this figure was
   <u>
    not
   </u>
   chosen by the Clintons, and it was well short of their monthly mortgage payment.)
  </li>
 </p>
 <p>
  <li>
   Most important, although regulations call for the payment of this amount, the Clintons did not in fact accept
   <u>
    any
   </u>
   money from the Secret Service.
