  On 1 September 2016 the web site

  published an

   article
  </a>
  reporting that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) proposed a 15 August 2016 rule newly granting the agency the power to apprehend, detain, and vaccinate by force any American citizen.
 </p>
 <p>
  The article’s composition suggested that the CDC had simply sought the power — without limitation — to arbitrarily apprehend, detain, and vaccinate Americans for no apparent reason:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has proposed a “rule” giving them the power to apprehend and detain anyone, anywhere, at any time, without Due Process or any right of appeal, and to hold that person in quarantine for as long as the CDC wants — and no one can refuse them! Editor’s Opinion: This is the kind of tyranny that the Second Amendment is designed to protect Americans from.
  </p>
  <p>
   Based on CDC’s 8/15/16 publication of ‘Rules for the Control of Communicable Diseases’, the CDC is giving itself the power to forcibly apprehend healthy people en masse, and detain them indefinitely with no process of appeal.
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    “and whether there are any public concerns with the absence of a specific maximum apprehension period in the regulation.”
   </em>
   <br>
    Of course and as would be expected from a totalitarian unconstitutional power grab,
   </br>
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    “When an apprehension occurs, the individual is not free to leave or discontinue his/her discussion with an HHS/CDC public health or quarantine officer.”
   </em>
   <br/>
   Moreover, the CDC also would like the public’s input on the fact their power is not limited to just individual persons but rather they could apprehend entire cities in mass if they so desired:
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    “the proposed practice to issue Federal orders before a medical examination has taken place. “
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   CDC sneaks in its unlimited and unchecked authority. They’ve couched this authority by describing how they “generally” expect it to work in a temporary manner, but they’ve also clearly stated it is open ended and there is no discussion of due process in the A&amp;D phase (again CDC wants your comments on this fact).
  </p>
  <p>
   IF an order of isolation, quarantine, or conditional release is issued, the CDC gives those so ordered one chance in the first 72 hours to ask CDC to change their minds, after which unlimited detention is again on the table.
  </p>
  <p>
   The CDC can stop, detain, and jail you anywhere.
  </p>
  <p>
   FORCED VACCINATION
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    “CDC may enter into an agreement with an individual, upon such terms as the CDC considers to be reasonably necessary, indicating that the individual consents to any of the public health measures authorized under this part, including quarantine, isolation, conditional release, medical examination, hospitalization, vaccination, and treatment; provided that the individual’s consent shall not be considered as a prerequisite to any exercise of any authority under this part.”
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   Even though the CDC believes it can force all the above procedures on individuals and groups, it also uses “voluntary agreements” for the sole purpose of making forced actions easier to perform. Anyone breaking these “voluntary agreements”, even if they didn’t agree to them, is subject to criminal prosecution.

  The article referenced by name a 15 August 2016 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)
  <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2016/08/15/2016-18103/control-of-communicable-diseases" target="_blank">
   document
  </a>
  published to the Federal Register pertaining to updated rule changes proposed by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). That document was prefaced with an section explaining that changes to quarantine regulations were being proposed due to recent outbreaks of communicable diseases (such as Ebola, MERS, and measles) around the world:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Through this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is amending its domestic (interstate) and foreign quarantine regulations to best protect the public health of the United States.
   <strong>
    These amendments are being proposed to aid public health responses to outbreaks of communicable diseases such as the largest recorded outbreak of Ebola virus disease (Ebola) in history, the recent outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in South Korea, and repeated outbreaks and responses to measles in the United States, as well as the ongoing threat of other new or re-emerging communicable diseases.
   </strong>
   The provisions contained herein provide additional clarity to various safeguards to prevent the importation and spread of communicable diseases affecting human health into the United States and interstate.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  In a section explaining the rationale behind the NPRM, the DHHS specifically stated that it included due process provisions to ensure that individual civil liberties would be well-balanced against proposed measures to protect public health:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   <strong>
    [T]his NPRM contains due process provisions (requirements relating to administrative records, quarantine, isolation, conditional release, medical examination, and agreements; authorization for payment for medical care and treatment; and an explanation of applicable criminal penalties) which are intended to inform the U.S. public of what steps HHS/CDC might take to protect public health during an outbreak while safeguarding the rights of the individual.
   </strong>
   Although these processes have been implemented through internal standard operating procedures, these procedures have not been codified, explicitly set forth in regulation, and made publicly available until today. These provisions are needed to provide transparency and assure the traveling public and any individual potentially placed under a Federal public health order that HHS/CDC will protect their individual liberties.
  </p>
