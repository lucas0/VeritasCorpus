 <p>
  The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has proposed a “rule” giving them the power to apprehend and detain anyone, anywhere, at any time, without Due Process or any right of appeal, and to hold that person in quarantine for as long as the CDC wants — and no one can refuse them! Editor’s Opinion: This is the kind of tyranny that the Second Amendment is designed to protect Americans from.
 </p>
 <p>
  Based on CDC’s 8/15/16 publication of ‘Rules for the Control of Communicable Diseases’, the CDC is giving itself the power to forcibly apprehend healthy people en masse, and detain them indefinitely with no process of appeal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “and whether there are any public concerns with the absence of a specific maximum apprehension period in the regulation.”
  </em>
  <br>
   Of course and as would be expected from a totalitarian unconstitutional power grab,
  </br>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “When an apprehension occurs, the individual is not free to leave or discontinue his/her discussion with an HHS/CDC public health or quarantine officer.”
  </em>
  <br/>
  Moreover, the CDC also would like the public’s input on the fact their power is not limited to just individual persons but rather they could apprehend entire cities in mass if they so desired:
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “the proposed practice to issue Federal orders before a medical examination has taken place. “
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  CDC sneaks in its unlimited and unchecked authority. They’ve couched this authority by describing how they “generally” expect it to work in a temporary manner, but they’ve also clearly stated it is open ended and there is no discussion of due process in the A&amp;D phase (again CDC wants your comments on this fact).
 </p>
 <p>
  IF an order of isolation, quarantine, or conditional release is issued, the CDC gives those so ordered one chance in the first 72 hours to ask CDC to change their minds, after which unlimited detention is again on the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  The CDC can stop, detain, and jail you anywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  FORCED VACCINATION
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   “CDC may enter into an agreement with an individual, upon such terms as the CDC considers to be reasonably necessary, indicating that the individual consents to any of the public health measures authorized under this part, including quarantine, isolation, conditional release, medical examination, hospitalization, vaccination, and treatment; provided that the individual’s consent shall not be considered as a prerequisite to any exercise of any authority under this part.”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though the CDC believes it can force all the above procedures on individuals and groups, it also uses “voluntary agreements” for the sole purpose of making forced actions easier to perform. Anyone breaking these “voluntary agreements”, even if they didn’t agree to them, is subject to criminal prosecution.
