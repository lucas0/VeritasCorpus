 <p>
  Welcome to our secret sister gift exchange! Here’s how it works:
 </p>
 <p>
  1) Send one gift value at least $10 to secret sister #1 below.
 </p>
 <p>
  2) Remove secret sister’s name from #1; then move secret sister #2 to that spot.
 </p>
 <p>
  3) Add your name to #2 with your info.
 </p>
 <p>
  4) Then send this info to 6 other ladies with the updated name info
 </p>
 <p>
  5) Copy the secret sister request that I posted on my wall, to your own wall. If you cannot complete this within 1 week please notify me, as it isn’t fair to the ladies who have participated and are waiting for their own gifts to arrive. You might want to order directly from a web-based service (Amazon, or any other online shop) which saves a trip to the post office. Soon you should receive 36 gifts! What a deal, 36 gifts for giving just one! Be sure to include some information about yourself … some of your favorites. Seldom does anyone drop out because it’s so much fun to send a gift to someone you may or may not know … and of course it’s fun to receive. You should begin receiving gifts in about 2 weeks if you get your letters out to your 6 people right away.
