  After serving a customer at Bamboo Thai Bistro in Redondo Beach, Calif., an Asian waitress received a short note scribbled on the receipt instead of a tip, according to NBC Los Angeles.
 </p>
 <p>
  It read, “Tip for U.S. citizens only.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The server is from Thailand and in the U.S. legally on a visa with the hope of obtaining a green card one day.

  According to NBC, on Nov. 11 a male diner paid for his meal of kung pao spaghetti that totaled $22.84 –which would have meant the server got $3.43.  But after discovering the nasty note, it’s believed another diner snapped a photo of the receipt, which included the man’s name–and posted it online.
