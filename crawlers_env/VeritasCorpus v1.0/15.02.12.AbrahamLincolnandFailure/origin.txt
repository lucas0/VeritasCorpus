   Abraham Lincoln Didn’t Quit
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  Probably the greatest example of persistence is Abraham Lincoln. If you want to learn about somebody who didn’t quit, look no further.
 </p>
 <p>
  Born into poverty, Lincoln was faced with defeat throughout his life. He lost eight elections, twice failed in business and suffered a nervous breakdown.
 </p>
 <p>
  He could have quit many times – but he didn’t and because he didn’t quit, he became one of the greatest presidents in the history of our country.

  Lincoln was a champion and he never gave up. Here is a sketch of Lincoln’s road to the White House:
