  There has been rumor around the internet that hip-hop artist, Ciara, was once a hermaphrodite until the age of 11, when she had surgery to remove her male “appendages.”

  I have heard a rumor that the R&amp;B star, Ciara, was born male. That he/she decided that he wanted to be a female at the age of 5, and his mother let him grow his hair out.  I was told that he had surgery, so he no longer has a penis. And apparently he/she was on Oprah having an in depth conversation about it, along with discussing it in a magazine article.
