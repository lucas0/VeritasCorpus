  There is no denying that the water in Flint is undrinkable and that it is contaminated with lead and other substances, and it is clear that the
  <a href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/michigan-cracks-marijuana-continuing-poison-entire-citys-water-supply/" target="_blank">
   government of Flint is responsible for the problem.

 </p>
 <p>
  However, the city’s government continues to charge people for the poison water and then threatening to foreclose their home or take their children if they refuse to pay. Michigan law states that parents are neglectful if they do not have running water in their home, and if they chose not to pay for water they can’t drink anyway, then they could be guilty of child endangerment. Activists in Flint say that some residents have already received similar threats from the government if they refuse to pay their bills … Flint residents have recently filed

   two class action lawsuits

  calling for all water bills since April of 2014 to be considered null and void because of the fact that the water was poisonous.

  “Essentially, the residents have been getting billed for water that they cannot use. Because of that, we do not feel that is a fair way to treat the residents,” [attorney Trachelle] Young added … Despite the fact that the issue is obviously the government’s responsibility, they have made it illegal for people to sell their homes because of the fact that they are known to carry contaminated water. Meanwhile, residents are still left to purchase bottled water on their own, in addition to paying their water bill.
