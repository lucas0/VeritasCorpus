 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   We were told the formula in Pepto-Bismol has recently changed, and it now contains xylitol in it as a sweetener, which is very toxic for dogs. This happened very recently, and the information has not yet been updated on the online lists.
   <br>
    As always, check with your Vet if you are unsure of anything. Until we know more, better safe than sorry. Check your labels.

  , and can cause fatal liver damage if a dog consumes enough of it. It can be found in some candy, sugar-free gum, peanut butter, chewable vitamins and oral health products like throat lozenges. Xylitol is not harmful to humans.

  As for Pepto-Bismol, it does not contain xylitol. A spokesperson for Procter and Gamble, the pharmaceutical company that makes the antacid, told us:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I can confirm that we do not add xylitol to any Pepto formulations (solid or liquid) and we have no plans to do so.
