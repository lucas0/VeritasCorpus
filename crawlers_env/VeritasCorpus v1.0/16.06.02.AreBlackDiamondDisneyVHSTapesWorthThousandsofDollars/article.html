  In late May 2016, several blogs reported that people in possession of “Black Diamond Collection” Disney VHS tapes might have
  <a href="http://www.techtimes.com/articles/161501/20160528/hit-jackpot-still-disney-movie-vhs.htm" target="_blank">
   thousands
  </a>
  of dollars’ worth of rare materials on their hands. Such blogs made the common mistake of not noting the disparity between what sellers ask for such items and what buyers are actually willing to pay, thus skewing perceptions by considering only the former.
  <br>
   The following article, for example, took into account only the listed asking prices on eBay for some Disney VHS tapes, without investigating whether any buyers were ever meeting those prices:
  </br>
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   According to eBay listings, the 1992 animated film
   <em>
    Beauty and the Beast
   </em>
   is going for just under $10,000. It’s not because the live-action reboot, starring Emma Watson, is coming out next year. This VHS is selling for so much because it is rare.

   piece
  </a>
  claimed that these collectors’ items have become increasingly rare due to Disney’s continual editing of their films, an action that renders the original versions largely unattainable except to buyers who procured home video copies during their initial releases:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A modern directorial practice includes the adding, editing, altering, etc… of films from their original theatrical version. Because of this, those original VHS tapes of Disney classic are worth a pretty penny, (think $1000 minimum!) In addition, these original tapes that include scenes or songs that may have been cut afterword, can be valuable to collectors for various reasons as well! Listings on eBay for an original Beauty and the Beast VHS is currently set at $9,999.99!

  Many such claims used eBay listings (not active bidding wars) as evidence of the stacks of cash Disney fans with VHS tapes might be sitting upon. But when we looked at eBay’s advanced search, only items with a high bidding

 <p>
  But the highest that people seemed willing to go for the purportedly rare and valuable tape was again about $25. Given the rumors, it is likely even those bids could be attributed to rumored (not actual) value attached to the item.

 <p>
  On 28 May 2016,
  <em>

  examined the rumors and located at least one item that had sold for a few thousand dollars. However, the outlet concluded that the auction’s outcome was an extreme rarity:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Black Diamond, found on the spine of the case,
   <a href="http://www.dvdizzy.com/blackdiamonds.html" target="_blank">

   </a>
   . It was included on 18 Disney animated features when they were first released to VHS format between 1988 and 1993. “Aladdin” was the last film to be released with a Black Diamond.

    three others spent at least $250
   </a>
   for a single tape – most copies seemingly sell between $5 and $25. Other popular films, such as “The Little Mermaid” and “Robin Hood,” fall within a similar range. Naturally, sealed tapes tend to go for a little more.

  On 7 April 2016, VHS and Betamax collector Dario Smagata answered a
  <em>
   <a href="https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-value-of-VHS-Disney-Black-Diamond-Series-tapes" target="_blank">
    Quora
   </a>
  </em>
  question about the value of Disney Black Diamond Collection VHS tapes; Smagata echoed the $5 to $25 range cited by
  <em>
   Philly Voice
  </em>
  and noted that the items were “not rare” by any definition:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="qtext_para">
   [The tapes are n]ot [worth] very much unless you can find the right person. Black Diamond tapes are becoming collectible, but they are not rare. You can find dozens of them in thrift stores, flea markets, and yard sales for $1 or less.
  </p>
  <p class="qtext_para">
   That said, Disney collectors may pay more for them if they are harder-to-find movies, or if the tapes are in excellent condition. You might find someone willing to pay quite a bit for them if that is the case, but there’s really no set value. It all depends on who comes along[.]
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="qtext_para">
  While it is true that a single Black Diamond Collection
  <em>
   Beauty and the Beast
  </em>
  Disney VHS tape once appears to have sold for $9,000 on eBay, the sale was almost certainly a fluke. Disney Black Diamond Collection VHS tapes are neither rare nor regularly selling for thousands, hundreds, or even tens of dollars. Higher priced listings of the videos on eBay did not attract any active bids.

  Similar stories abound about Beanie Babies, the toys that were briefly a craze in the 1990s, and now litter sites like Etsy and Ebay.  One such account made waves in 2015, when a couple bought a Princess Beanie Baby for a pittance, then claimed that it was worth
