  “The force which binds my concepts as a perceptual realist stems from my observations of contemporary human civilization and its relevance to the natural world. All subjects are bound together with metaphoric juxtaposition to render an enigmatic association giving the narrative of each image a subjective conclusion. The intent is to create a neutral platform of description as to the statement being made within the composition.

  My interest in environmental sciences has always been the nucleus on my creativity. I base my artistic expression on what I have experienced on this subject as well as combining the contemporary condition of human civilization in the 21st century. My goal is to depict human relevance to the environment from the perspective of modern culture”
