  John F. Kennedy Jr. was a popular public figure from his childhood until he died in a plane crash at the age of 38 in 1999. While there is never a shortage of conspiracy theories surrounding the Kennedys, or for that matter, the Clintons, the latest unfounded rumor circulating in political circles claims that John-John was on the cusp of a successful U.S. Senate bid until Hillary Clinton threw her hat in the ring — with the insinuation that Clinton had Kennedy killed to clear the way for her.

  There is no evidence that Kennedy had definitively decided to stage a U.S. Senate run in 1999 in the face of Hillary Clinton’s similar interest in the New York seat.  Days after Kennedy’s 16 July 1999 death, the New York

  quoting two unnamed friends of Kennedy’s who stated that Kennedy had mulled over running for the seat about to be vacated by retiring Senator Daniel Moynihan but had already dropped the idea when Hillary Clinton also expressed interest in it:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Earlier this year, in one of the best-kept secrets in state politics, Kennedy considered seeking the seat of retiring Sen. Daniel Moynihan in 2000, friends confirmed.
   <strong>
    The idea became moot once First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton signaled her interest in running
   </strong>
   , but the two friends said they expected the son of the slain President eventually would have jumped into politics as a candidate.

   The friend who expected Kennedy to seek office in the “foreseeable future” also told of speaking with Kennedy earlier this year about the Moynihan seat. “I asked him was he casually thinking about it, or was he serious. He sort of said, ‘I’m not sure. Let me think about it.
  </p>
  <p>
   But the second friend called Kennedy’s interest “pretty serious,” adding: “I think he was intrigued by the idea … Would he have decided in the end to go for it? I don’t know. But he was clearly thinking about it. He talked to a few people about it.
   <strong>
    Then the Hillary thing ended it pretty quickly
