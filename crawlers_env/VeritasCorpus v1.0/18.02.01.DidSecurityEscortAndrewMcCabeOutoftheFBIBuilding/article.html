   The walk of shame.
  </p>
  <p>
   McCabe is escorted out by security after being forced out of the FBI. I’m sorry, but if McCabe has done half of what we think he has done he deserved every last big of embarrassment he felt leaving the FBI!!

  <p>
   Sorry Andy, no going away party for you!!

  This image is real and does show McCabe, but it is also miscaptioned in what looks like a rather ham-handed attempt to make him appear guilty of something: It was not taken in January 2018, and it does not show McCabe being escorted out of the FBI building by security.

  Andrew McCabe did leave the FBI in January 2018. This photograph, however, is unrelated to his departure.
