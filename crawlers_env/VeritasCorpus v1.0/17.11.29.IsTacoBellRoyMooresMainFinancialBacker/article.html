   After finding out that Taco Bell’s a major supporter for Roy Moore, I Googled their corporate office contact info and created a screenshot of it. Feel free to call, fax, tweet and email them that you’re going to boycott their restaurants until they withdraw their support for this pedophile.

  A 27 November 2017 Daily Beast
  <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/roy-moore-super-pac-financier-finally-revealed" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  reported that newly accessed records had revealed that one of Moore’s donors is a businessman named Peter Nicholas. According to reports, an unknown number of Taco Bell franchises are among Nicholas’ ventures:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   <em>
    Newly released documents show Illinois businessman Richard Uihlein is the moneyman behind a group seeking to send Moore to the Senate
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   The chief financier of a leading pro-Roy Moore super PAC is a deep-pocketed Republican businessman who dropped eight figures on 2016 races alone and is looking to continue propping up the party’s most conservative candidates.
  </p>
  <p>
   Illinois businessman Richard Uihlein provided $100,000 to the group, Proven Conservatives PAC, since September, according to a new filing with the Federal Election Commission, making him by far the group’s top donor. That money, which hadn’t been previously disclosed, has financed a host of ads boosting Moore’s candidacy in the face of widespread sexual assault and harassment allegations. The group has also run ads attacking Moore’s primary opponent, Sen. Luther Strange (R-AL), and his Democratic general election rival Doug Jones.
  </p>
  <p>
   Proven Conservative PAC officially formed in late August, as the Alabama Senate primary contest heated up. The only major financial support it had previously reported came from a company owned by the family of Alabama timber executive Guice Slawson.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to Uihlein, Proven Conservative received money in September from Peter Nicholas, a Florida-based businessman whose chain of Taco Bell franchises has also donated to the campaign of Omar Navarro, a quixotic Republican challenger to California Democrat Rep. Maxine Waters.

  Nicholas is not the owner of either Taco Bell or Yum! Brands; according to reports, he only owns Taco Bell
  <a href="https://www.tacobellfranchise.com/faq" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   franchises

  in Florida. How many and which franchises is not immediately apparent, but the majority of Taco Bells are neither owned nor operated by Nicholas. Calls for a boycott or an appeal to the chain’s corporate offices appear to be misguided.
