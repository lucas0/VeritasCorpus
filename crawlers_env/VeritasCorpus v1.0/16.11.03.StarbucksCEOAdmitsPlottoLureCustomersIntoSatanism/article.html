  On 10 November 2015, the
  <em>
   Dandy Goat
  </em>
  web site published an article reporting that Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz had admitted to using the store’s new “
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/starbucks-red-christmas-cups/" target="_blank">
   holiday cups
  </a>
  ” (controversial for their lack of overt Christmas symbolism) to lure the giant coffee chain’s customers into the practice Satanism:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Following outrage over the coffee giant’s decision to supplant its annual Christmas-themed snowflake paper cups with diabolical red ones, Starbucks has admitted to advancing a plot to lure customers into Satanic worship. The company is consequently halting the release of devil-themed holiday mugs, and it will abandon plans for a “Lucifer’s Delight” seasonal latte.
  </p>
  <p>
   “The allegations that we wanted customers to unwittingly deny their Christian faith and invite Satan to commandeer their souls are totally founded,” said Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, dressed in a black robe and clutching a book written by Anton LaVey.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  There was no truth to the above-quoted story.
  <em>
   The Dandy Goat
  </em>
  is a satirical publication, and their article about Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz and Satanism was a spoof of the (largely manufactured) “
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/starbucks-red-christmas-cups/" target="_blank">
   holiday cups
  </a>
  ” controversy of 2015.
