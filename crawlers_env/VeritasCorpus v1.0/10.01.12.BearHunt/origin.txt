  How would you like for this monster to walk up on you in the woods? Check out the size of the paw in relation to the guy’s head!!!

  This bear was killed down on Hitchenbrook Island by an airman stationed at Elmendorf.
 </p>
 <p>
  The bear measured 12′ 6″ and was estimated at over 1600lbs.
 </p>
 <p>
  The guy was walking to his hunting area and the bear stood up only
  <nobr>
   35 yards
  </nobr>
  away. The bear dropped down and went straight for him. He emptied his gun and the bear fell
  <nobr>
   10 yards
  </nobr>
  from him.

  The attached picture is of a guy who works for the forest service in Alaska. He was out deer hunting. A large…large world record Grizzly bear charged him from about
  <nobr>
   50 yards
  </nobr>
  away. The guy unloaded a 7mm Mag
  <nobr>
   Semi-auto
  </nobr>
  into the bear and it dropped a few feet from him. The thing was still alive so he reloaded and capped it in the head. It was over one thousand six hundred pounds,
  <nobr>
   12 feet
  </nobr>
  <nobr>
   6 inches
  </nobr>
  high at the shoulder. It’s a world record. The bear had killed a couple of other people. Of course, the game department did not let him keep it. Think about it. This thing on its hind legs could walk up to the average single story house and could look on the roof at eye level.”
