  This is a real photograph, but the women pictured were not convicted witches; nor is the image from 1922. Instead, the women posed for the

   The photograph was not only misdated, it is also often interpreted as real life — what it probably would have been in 1907. But this is not, and probably never was, daily life in the Shanghai Concessions. It is a studio creation, as is confirmed by the setup in front of a Western window, not in the street; the lack of the pasted slip of paper stating the reason for the punishment (a legal obligation); and the pristine condition of the three women who cannot have been standing there more than the few minutes necessary for the exposure.
