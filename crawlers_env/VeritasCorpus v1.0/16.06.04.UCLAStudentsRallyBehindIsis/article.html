   On Thursday, over 5,000 UCLA students held a candlelight vigil for fallen ISIS soldiers whose lives were cut short by drone strikes or machine gun fire in Syria and Iraq. Humanities professor Thomas T. Turnbolt organized the nighttime vigil; he had found solidarity with ISIS combatants during a year-long sojourn to Syria, where he witnessed the harsh and inhumane conditions under which ISIS soldiers operate. Turnbolt rejected the word “terrorist,” preferring the word “freedom fighters” to describe his heavily-armed, bomb wielding comrades.klug-vigil-armsup_mid

   Professor Turnbolt distributed flyers and hung posters across southern California’s largest campus, encouraging students to abandon preconceived hatred and instead adopt tolerance and understanding under the banner of cultural diversity.  The ISIS vigil was so successful it even attracted supporters from other California schools.
