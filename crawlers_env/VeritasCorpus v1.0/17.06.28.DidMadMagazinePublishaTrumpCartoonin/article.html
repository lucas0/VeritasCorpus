  This is a real comic that was published by
  <em>
   Mad Magazine
  </em>
  in 1992.

  Some were skeptical that
  <em>
   Mad
  </em>
  had really lampooned President Trump in the 1990s, but it’s not really all that surprising. Although Trump has only been president for a five months as of this writing, he has been a public figure for much of his life. In fact, shortly after Trump became president,
  <em>
   Mad
  </em>
  released a book of previously published comics “chronicling his rise from obnoxious businessman to really obnoxious reality show host to uber obnoxious “Commander-in-Tweet.” Cartoonist Garry Trudeau put out a similar book chronicling 30 years of Trump’s appearances in

  Sam Viviano and Mike Snider created the 1992 Trump cartoon for

  ” page, which featured various politicians, musicians, reporters, and other public figures giving contradictory statements.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here is how the comic was introduced in 1992:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Sometimes people lie. Sometimes people tell the truth. But sometimes, people lie and tell the truth on the same subject at different times! (Like, for example, BEFORE and AFTER an election!) So, the question we out to be asking about these people is not the usual “Why should we believe,” but rather…. WHEN SHOULD WE BELIEVE…?
