  Dear University of Maryland,
 </p>
 <p>
  I was your Valedictorian until about a month ago and almost gave the Main Commencement Speech at graduation, but instead of giving the speech, I decided to follow my dreams, fail all my classes this semester, and drop out of school two weeks before graduation without getting a degree. If you would like to know why your Valedictorian dropped out of school, you’re welcome to read my email to my parents below:

  Dear Mom and Dad,
 </p>
 <p>
  I finally found my destiny this semester in college.
 </p>
 <p>
  I have finally understood how leadership, happiness, and fearlessness actually work.
 </p>
 <p>
  Leadership is very simple.
 </p>
 <p>
  All you need to have is a lot of confidence and a lot of empathy both at the same time.
 </p>
 <p>
  You need confidence to know what you want to do and do it.
 </p>
 <p>
  You need empathy to understand other people’s perspectives, emotions, wants, and desires so you can lead them and help them achieve their goals.
 </p>
 <p>
  You make yourself happy and you make everybody around you happy.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can’t have confidence without emotional intelligence or emotional intelligence without confidence.
 </p>
 <p>
  You need both. …
 </p>
 <p>
  This semester I have finally understood that my true passion and dream is to become a self made entrepreneur.
 </p>
 <p>
  A CEO.
 </p>
