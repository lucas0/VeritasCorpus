   reporting

  that a New York woman named Lisa Estevez had shot and killed her boyfriend on 1 April 2016 after the marriage proposal he offered to her was revealed as an April Fool’s Day prank:

 <blockquote>

   Lisa Estevez, 31, is facing first degree murder charges after she shot and killed Ray Jordan, age 25, in the chest. According to authorities, Lisa shot Ray after an April fools prank had gone terribly wrong. Authorities say Ray, who had been dating Lisa for 3 years, apparently got on his knees and proposed to Lisa, only to them open the engagement ring box and reveal the words “April Fools” written inside with no engagement ring to be found. Lisa then immediately reached for Jordan’s firearm, which was laying on the living room couch and shot Jordan once in the chest, killing him instantly.

   Authorities arrived to the home when neighbors reported the gunshots. “We arrived at the scene and saw Mr. Jordan’s corpse” says NYPD officer James Patterson, “Then I looked to his side and immediately saw the Engagement ring box with ‘April Fools’ written inside and immediately knew what had happened,” finished Officer Patterson.
