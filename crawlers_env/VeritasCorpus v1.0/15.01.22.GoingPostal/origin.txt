<blockquote>
 <p>
  It was recently learned that the United States has entered into a contract with one firm to sell
  <nobr>
   56 buildings
  </nobr>
  that currently house U.S. Post Offices. The government has decided that it no longer needs these buildings (many of which are located on prime land in towns and cities across the country).
 </p>
 <p>
  The sale of these properties will bring in billions of dollars and, with that, millions of dollars in commissions for the one Company that is in charge of handling the sale and negotiation of the new leases.
 </p>
 <p>
  What makes this such a matter of concern is that the company that the Government has contracted with to conduct the sales (and the corresponding leases for the new locations of the displaced post offices) is owned by Richard Blum.
 </p>
 <p>
  Does that name mean anything to you? Maybe it should
  <nobr>
   re-phrased
  </nobr>
  and say that the person who owns the company that is solely in charge of this multi-million-dollar transaction is Richard Blum the husband of Senator Dianne Feinstein.
