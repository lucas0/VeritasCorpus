 <p>
  According to the
  <i>
   Japan Quality of Life Survey
  </i>
  , conducted in 2013 by the Japanese governmentâ€™s Economic and Social Research Institute, 32% of respondents reported that they were somewhat or very concerned about dying alone. According to our own analysis of the data, the worries are negatively correlated with subjective well-being. Worries about solitary death show one of the highest negative correlations with happiness.
