  The image of @Millenial_Matt with Trump, however, was digitally manipulated to show the two men together. The original image was
  <a href="http://www.gazettenet.com/Local-Bernie-supporter-took-selfie-with-Trump-used-in-campaign-3556045" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   taken
  </a>
  in July 2016 and showed Miles Chilson, a Bernie Sanders supporter, at a Trump rally:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Chilson, of Florence, chose to attend a Trump event after meeting Sanders during a January rally at University of Massachusetts Amherst.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Being a liberal pretty much my entire life, I didn’t think it was fair to decide that I wanted one candidate without seeing the other side,” he said.
  </p>
  <p>
   Half for self-education, half as a practical joke, Chilson arrived at Trump’s Jan. 5 rally in Claremont, N.H., doused in the Republican nominee’s cologne.
  </p>
  <p>
   “It was basically going to be comedy for me,” he said.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chilson said Wednesday that regardless of his views, he went in with an open mind.
  </p>
  <p>
   After passing through security, Chilson was given Trump signs to hold by campaign staff and wound up in a spot close to the stage.
  </p>
  <p>
   “He went through all of his speech and said stuff that appalled me, but I stayed quiet,” Chilson said of Trump. He said the rhetoric included allegations of China building warships and negative remarks about Muslims from crowd members.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  Here’s a comparison of the two images:

   @Millenial_Matt took to Twitter to clarify that the image had been doctored, saying, “People think the pic of Trump and I is real. It is a photoshop hah.” Journalist Raf Sanchez deleted and
