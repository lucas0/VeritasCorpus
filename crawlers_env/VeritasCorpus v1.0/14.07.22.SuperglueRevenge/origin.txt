  A local small town public official, who was married, had been having a high time of it with a girlfriend on the side. One way or another, his wife found out about it and took revenge.
 </p>
 <p>
  One night, with our official in a sleeping, erect state, she super-glued his penis to his belly. He ended up driving himself into the Emergency Department of a hospital in Cape Girardeau, MO, to be freed of this sticky situation.

  When one lady had absolute proof of her manâ€™s bombastic bedding habits with other ladies, she devised a scheme that would guarantee his sticking around. On one rare night when he was in their bed, his mate waited until he had fallen into his usual deep sleep then gently applied one of the new superglue products to both his penis and his leg and held the two together for the short bonding time so well advertised on television.
 </p>
 <p>
  No elephant, tractor or pro footballer could break that bond. It took the delicate skill of the family physician to make the separation, a move which was matched that afternoon by the vindicated lady who also cut out on her very sore ex-man.
