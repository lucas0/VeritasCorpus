  On 11 August 2017 the web site Conservative Fighters published a story attempting to link a woman convicted of voting illegally with 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton:

  The headline read:

 <blockquote>

   Arrogant Illegal Brags About Voting 5 Times For Hillary Sees the Judge – Her Sentence Is Devastating!

  The story describes 37-year-old Rosa Maria Ortega as a “Mexican national and illegal alien.” In fact, Ortega is a permanent U.S. resident, meaning that she had the

  right to live and work in the country prior to being

   convicted
  </a>
  of voting illegally on 8 February 2017. However, permanent U.S. residents are not allowed to vote. Ortega, who was brought into the U.S. as a child, will reportedly be deported to Mexico after serving eight years in prison.

  The story itself makes no mention of Clinton — probably because the case against Ortega does not involve the 2016 election. According to her attorney Clark Birdsall, when Ortega did vote, she actually chose conservative candidates:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   She voted for Mitt Romney over Barack Obama in the 2012 election. In 2014 she voted for our current [Texas] attorney general, Ken Paxton. And guess what? He’s the one responsible for prosecuting her.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Moreover, Ortega did not “vote 5 times” in a single election; she

   reportedly
  </a>
  voted five times since 2004, but only voted once during each election. Ortega claimed in

  Conservatives have repeatedly claimed that millions of undocumented immigrants voted illegally in past U.S. elections. However, those
