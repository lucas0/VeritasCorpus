  A missive touting a regimen that calls for the ingestion of four glasses of water first thing in the morning followed by the restriction of drinking after meals began circulating on the Internet in August 2004.

  Our earliest sighting of this item came from a message board post, where it was presented without any comment identifying its author. Its central claims to authority, that “scientific tests have proven its value” and “water treatment had been found successful by a Japanese medical society as a hundred percent cure for [various diseases]” are unsupported; we were unable to locate any record of “scientific tests” proving this hypothesis, nor of statements issued in support of it by a “Japanese medical society.”

  Diabetes, cancer, and tuberculosis are serious illnesses that are not subject to being easily cured by even the latest medical technologies, let alone by tap water.

  intake in an effort to treat constipation that:

  <p>
   Research shows that although increased fluid intake does not necessarily help relieve constipation, many people report some relief from their constipation if they drink fluids such as water and juice and avoid dehydration. Liquids add fluid to the colon and bulk to stools, making bowel movements softer and easier to pass.
