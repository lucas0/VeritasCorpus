  that they had concocted the viral video as a marketing ploy:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   HAWTHORN have launched their 2016 finals campaign, Embrace the hunt, with the release of an innovative viral video.

   The video which features a hawk dropping a snake onto a family picnicking along the Yarra River was originally posted to YouTube under the alias of ‘Douglas Wong.’
