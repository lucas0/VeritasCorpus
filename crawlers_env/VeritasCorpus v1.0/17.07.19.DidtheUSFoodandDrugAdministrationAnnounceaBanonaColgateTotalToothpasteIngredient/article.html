  On 26 June 2017, Woman Daily Tips published an
  <a href="http://archive.is/g8tqP" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  appearing to report that the Food and Drug Administration  had just announced it would be banning the antimicrobial agent triclosan, which is commonly found in soaps and toothpaste:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The FDA has just issued a warning this week noting that they will be putting a ban on triclosan — a common antibacterial agent used in soaps, detergents, toys, cosmetics, and toothpaste. Apparently, the chemical poses a high-degree of health risks and side effects.
  </p>
  <p>
   Colgate Total is just one of many products that list triclosan as an active ingredient.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  In reality, Colgate Total is one of very few products containing triclosan that the FDA has
  <em>
   not
  </em>
  banned. In September 2016, the agency
  <a href="https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm517478.htm" target="_blank">
   ruled
  </a>
  that a host of antiseptic and antibacterial wash products could no longer be sold in the United States, due to the presence of certain ingredients — including triclosan:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The agency issued a
   <a href="https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ssLINK/UCM378542" target="_blank">
    proposed rule in 2013
   </a>
   after some data suggested that long-term exposure to certain active ingredients used in antibacterial products — for example, triclosan (liquid soaps) and triclocarban (bar soaps) — could pose health risks, such as bacterial resistance or hormonal effects.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  However, this ruling did not include Colgate Total because the manufacturers — Colgate-Palmolive — were able to demonstrate that the health benefits of the product (it is
  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/07/well/live/why-your-toothpaste-has-triclosan.html?_r=0" target="_blank">
   effective
  </a>
  at reducing plaque and gingivitis) outweighed any potential for harm. At the time, FDA spokesperson Andrea Fischer
  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/07/well/live/why-your-toothpaste-has-triclosan.html?_r=0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   told
  </a>
  the
  <em>
   New York Times
  </em>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Based on scientific evidence, the balance of benefit and risk is favorable for these products.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The FDA’s official stance on Colgate Total has not changed since September 2016, and the product was included in the June 2017 approved drug product
  <a href="https://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/ucm071118.pdf" target="_blank">
   list
  </a>
  . The American Dental Association also lists Colgate Total as an “accepted
  <a href="http://www.ada.org/en/science-research/ada-seal-of-acceptance/ada-seal-shopping-list" target="_blank">
   product
  </a>
  “.
 </p>
 <p>
  The irony of the Woman Daily Tips article is that it singles out a specific brand of toothpaste as being the subject of an imminent ban due to its containing triclosan, when in fact Colgate Total is conspicuous as a product that was not banned in a September 2016 ruling on triclosan. Contrary to the article’s claim, the FDA did not make an announcement during the week of 26 June 2017 that a ban on Colgate Total, or an additional ban on triclosan, was imminent; nor did the agency make such an announcement at any time during the first half of 2017.
