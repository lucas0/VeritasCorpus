  On 1 May 2017, the web site World News Daily Report (a notorious purveyor of
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2016/01/14/fake-news-sites/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   fake news
  </a>
  ) posted an article seemingly reporting that a babysitter in Cincinnati, Ohio was admitted to a local hospital after paramedics found a toddler wedged in her vagina:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Latifah Brown called 911 around 9:30 PM last night, reporting that she had a baby stuck in her vagina.
  </p>
  <p>
   The operator first assumed that she was giving birth at home and dispatched an ambulance to the site.
  </p>
  <p>
   The paramedics had quite a surprise when they arrived on the site and saw what was actually happening.
  </p>
  <p>
   One of the paramedics, Brian Whitmore, related the incident in an interview with WBNS-10 TV.
  </p>
  <p>
   “The little boy wore a diaper and pyjamas, but he had his legs and abdomen stuck in the woman’s vagina.”
  </p>
  <p>
   The paramedics spent more than an hour on the site trying to release the child from his difficult position but were unable to get the toddler out.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  After being transported to a hospital, where doctors successfully removed the baby (the article continues), Brown confessed to “deliberately inserting the child in her vaginal cavity” and was charged by police with “aggravated child neglect.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Not a word of which is true.

  As we have noted on many
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/tag/world-news-daily-report/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   occasions
  </a>
  (and as World News Daily Report states on its own
  <a href="http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/disclaimer_/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   disclaimer

  page), all of the content on the site is fictional:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   All characters appearing in the articles in this website – even those based on real people –  are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.
