  On 11 March 2016, social media users began spreading a report that the U.S. Supreme Court had revoked the Church of Scientology’s tax-exempt status:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In a unanimous decision by the Supreme Court today, the eight justices ruled in favor of revoking the Church of Scientology’s tax-exempt status in the United States. Under the ruling, Scientology will still be able to operate as a business but no longer as a non-profit religious organization.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  There was no truth to this rumor, however. It was just a bit of fiction apparently originating with one of the clickbait fake news malware sites that illegally appropriate the trademarks of legitimate news organizations in order to drive traffic and thereby generate advertising revenues. One such site carries a disclaimer reading:

   If you are reading this, you’ve been duped yet again by one of my unimaginative, unfunny fake “news” stories.  More money for me, you stupid idiot.  Ha, ha!
