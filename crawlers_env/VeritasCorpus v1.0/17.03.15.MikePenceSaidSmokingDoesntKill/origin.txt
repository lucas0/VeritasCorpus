  Mike Pence, the vice president-elect of the US, has said he doesn’t believe smoking kills people.
 </p>
 <p>
  He made that case in an op-ed article published in 2000 and has made no public effort to update his position since.

  “Time for a quick reality check,” Pence wrote. “Despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn’t kill. In fact, 2 out of every three smokers does not die from a smoking related illness and 9 out of ten smokers do not contract lung cancer.”
