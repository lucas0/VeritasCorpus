  On 3 November 2016, the web site Got News published an
  <a href="http://archive.is/cYNGw" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  reporting that former
  <em>
   Apprentice
  </em>
  contestant Summer Zervos had been paid $500,000 to accuse Donald Trump of sexual harrassment:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   <em>
    The Apprentice
   </em>
   loser and Trump “fake rape” accuser Summer Zervos was bribed $500,000 by Democrat fundraiser and lawyer Gloria Allred to make her accusations against Donald Trump, a deal that was shopped around to other ex-
   <em>
    Apprentice
   </em>
   contestants too, according to anonymous sources familiar with the matter.
  </p>
  <p>
   GotNews’ source tells us that Zervos’ sexual harassment accusation against Trump is a “completely fabricated hoax.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Zervos was paid half a million dollars by Gloria Allred, which is being paid out “slowly over time” according to our source.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Got News provided no evidence to back up their claim, which was based entirely on a comment made by an unidentified source.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gloria Allred, Zervos’ attorney, called the “tip” completely false:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I have been a lawyer and fighter for justice for 40 years. Those who are responsible for this malicious lie should know that if I find out who they are I will hold them accountable. Those who made up this lie know it is a lie and that is why they are afraid to give their name, and have decided to spread their lie anonymously.
