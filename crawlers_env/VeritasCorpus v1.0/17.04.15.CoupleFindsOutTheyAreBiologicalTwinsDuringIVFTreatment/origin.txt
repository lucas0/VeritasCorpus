<blockquote>
 <p>
  A married couple who struggled to conceive only discovered they were twins when they went through IVF.
 </p>
 <p>
  The unnamed couple underwent the treatment to help them have a baby.
 </p>
 <p>
  But doctors at the fertility lab noticed their DNA was abnormally similar.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, lab technicians believed the pair may be unwitting cousins, but soon ruled that out because the DNA was too similar.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eventually doctors confronted the pair, who burst out in laughter when they were asked if they were related.
