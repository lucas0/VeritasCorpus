  On 21 September 2016, the Health Eternally web site published an

   article

  headlined “Scientists Find Root That Kills 98% of Cancer Cells in Only 48 Hours,” proclaiming that:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   According to Dr. Carolyn Hamm from the Windsor Regional Cancer Centre in Ontario, Canada, dandelion root extract was the only thing that helped with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. This form of cancer typically affects older adults.
  </p>
  <p>
   John Di Carlo, who at the time was a 72-year old cancer patient at the hospital, was sent home to live out his final days after all efforts failed to treat his leukemia. He told CBC News that he was advised to drink dandelion root tea as a last ditch effort. Perhaps it should have been the first option offered in his treatment plan, as his cancer went into remission only four months later! His doctors attributed this to the dandelion tea that he drank.
  </p>
  <p>
   Recent studies have shown that dandelion root extract can work very quickly on cancer cells, as was evidenced in Di Carlo’s case. Within 48 hours of coming into contact with the extract, cancerous cells begin to disintegrate. The body happily replaces these with healthy new cells.

  No particular research of the type touted by the headline was referenced in the Health Eternally article, and although its wording suggested that the cited case and purported findings were recent, the article’s text linked only to a single CBC news report published back in February 2012.  That CBC reporting indicated only that researchers “hoped to test” dandelion root’s potential as a treatment for one specific type of cancer, not that dandelion root had actually been established as an effective cancer cure:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Researchers hope to test dandelion tea on patients at a Windsor, Ont., clinic after it was found the roots of the weed killed cancer cells in the laboratory.
  </p>
  <p>
   The promising research is being led by a University of Windsor oncologist, in association with the Windsor Regional Cancer Centre.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dr. Caroline Hamm said dandelion root extract is unique, and is one of the only things found to help with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.
  </p>
  <p>
   The roots of the common dandelion were ground up and made into tea. According to researchers, early results show that the tea kills cancer cells in the lab.
