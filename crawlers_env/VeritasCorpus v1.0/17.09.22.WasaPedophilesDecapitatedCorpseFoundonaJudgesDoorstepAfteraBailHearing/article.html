   report

  about the discovery of a headless body in Jackson, Mississippi. An autopsy on the body revealed that it was 30-year-old Jeremy Jerome Jackson:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Autopsy results show that 30-year-old Jeremy Jerome Jackson’s head was severed while he was still alive. He also suffered a non-fatal gunshot wound to the leg.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jackson was beheaded and his torso found burned Saturday. Tuesday Jackson police announced a $20,000.00 reward for information that leads to an arrest in the Jeremy Jackson murder.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through tears, Johnny Jackson recounted the last time he saw his younger brother Jeremy. It was last Friday. He then got the call Saturday, about his disturbing murder.
  </p>
  <p>
   “From my speculation, it was a message sent from somebody or to the city because you just don’t kill somebody in the bushes then take their head and put it on display,” said Jackson. “They displayed him and you could ride down the street and see it on the step. To me, it was a message sent to somebody.”
