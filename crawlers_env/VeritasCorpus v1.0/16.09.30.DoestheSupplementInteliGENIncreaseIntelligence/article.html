  A supplement called InteliGEN that boasts the ability to “help you enhance focus, boost intelligence and increase your productivity” is apparently being sold, although we could not verify the price, nor could we verify the ingredients of the product.
 </p>
 <p>
  The web site for the product, at inteligen.org, claims the product contains “all-natural, pure and safe ingredients,” and is produced in a “state-of-the-art facility by an elite USA manufacturer.” The product web site lists four ingredients in the supplement: bacopa monnieri, vinpocetine, ginkgo biloba and acetyl-l-carnitine.
 </p>
 <p>
  While each of these ingredients are listed by the scientific web site
  <em>

   </a>
  </em>
  as nootropic supplements (or cognitive enhancers), vinpocetine is not all-natural, it is manufactured:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Vinpocetine is a synthetic alkaloid derived from the periwinkle plant (specifically, synthesized from the molecule known as ‘vincamine’) that appears to have a track record of usage in European countries for the treatment of cognitive decline, stroke recovery, and epilepsy. Vinpocetine is also commonly used as a Nootropic compound in the hopes that it may promote memory formation.
  </p>

 <p>
  The web site for the supplement further claims it is “carefully crafted with patent ingredients to provide essential nutrients to the brain.” However we could find no

   patents
  </a>
  registered in the United States for a product called InteliGEN. We were also unable to find such a product described by the medical database
  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/search/search_results/default.aspx?query=inteliGEN" target="_blank">
   WebMD
  </a>
  . And while the InteliGEN web site claims the supplement is “clinically proven,” we couldn’t locate any evidence of clinical trials or testing on the product. In general, Examine.com urges caution with nootopic supplements:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Many Nootropics have limited studies in humans, and the brain itself is still a very unknown organ. Despite the promise of many of these compounds, caution should be exerted to a larger degree when supplementing with some of them.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Overall the web site for InteliGEN seems vague and does not provide a label for the product so consumers can review a full list of ingredients. It allows potential customers to fill out their personal information in order to receive a “free bottle.”
 </p>
 <p>
  According to
  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/" target="_blank">
   WebMD
  </a>
  , all the ingredients it claims to contain have are considered “possibly safe,” or in the case of ginkgo biloba, “likely safe.” All have potential side effects, and none of the ingredients should be ingested during pregnancy. Overall we can’t confirm the supplement does what it claims to do, as we can’t even verify what its ingredients are. As with any supplement, consult a doctor before opting to take it.
