 <p>
  In the name of progress,
  <strong>
   Harvard University will segregate graduation ceremonies
  </strong>
  based on race.
 </p>
 <p>
  For real.
 </p>
 <p>
  The segregation will include only graduate students this year, but there are plans to expand such racial separation next year to all university students, including undergrads.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shockingly, this is not as rare as it may seem. As noted by BET, “Stanford, Temple and Columbia all have Black student graduations.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Martin Luther King Jr. would be proud.
