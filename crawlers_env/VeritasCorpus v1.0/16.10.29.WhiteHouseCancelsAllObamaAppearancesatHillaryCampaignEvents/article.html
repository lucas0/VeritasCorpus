  On 28 October 2016, the disreputable web site SuperStation 95 published an
  <a href="http://archive.is/0XCIl" target="_blank">

  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2016/10/28/fbi-reopening-clinton-e-mail-investigation/" target="_blank">
   announcement

  <p>
   “DEVASTATING REVELATIONS”
  </p>
  <p>
