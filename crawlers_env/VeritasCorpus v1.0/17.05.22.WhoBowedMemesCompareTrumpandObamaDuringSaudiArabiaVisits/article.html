  In May 2017, memes and macros comparing photographs of President Barack Obama’s and President Donald Trump’s respective trips to Saudi Arabia appeared after President Trump’s visit to the country.
 </p>
 <p>
  Images appeared to show Obama bowing at the waist to a Saudi leader, and Trump standing straight in a similar situation:

  The meme was widely shared in some circles, along with comments and suggestions about how a president of the U.S. should behave while on diplomatic missions. The hyperpartisan web site

  These two photographs are both real, but lack context. The photograph of Obama was taken in 2009 at the G20

  that Obama was actually bowing:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “It wasn’t a bow. He grasped his hand with two hands, and he’s taller than King Abdullah.”
  </p>

 <p>
  President Obama’s purported bow became a continuous talking point throughout his presidency, with his detractors portraying the gesture as a sign of weakness. In 2012, Trump used it to question Obama’s diplomatic skills:

  Although many painted Obama’s bowing as a sign of weakness or deference, he was not the first sitting president to bow (or to be criticized for bowing) to a foreign leader. President Nixon

  <p>
   In an online State Department posting from 2007 titled “Protocol for the Modern Diplomat,” envoys are advised to be aware of greeting rituals such as kisses, handshakes or bows and to follow a country’s tradition.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Failure to abide with tradition may be interpreted as rudeness or a lack of respect for colleagues,” advises the posting, which make no mention of whether the rules should apply to a President as well.

  The photograph of Trump is also genuine. That image was taken on 20 May 2017 after the President touched down in Riyadh and King Salman Abdullah bin Abdulaziz greeted him. A video of the meeting shows that Trump did not bow:

   It wasn’t long before a countermeme appeared, purportedly showing how President Trump bowed while receiving an honor from the King of Saudi Arabia, while Obama had not:

 </p>
 <blockquote class="“twitter-tweet”" data-lang="“en”">

   Funny, unlike Trump, Obama didn’t bow to the King of Saudi Arabia when receiving the Order of King Abdulaziz.

   Embarrassing Trump voters!

  This meme is also misleading. It shows President Obama removing the medal from his shoulders. In reality, Obama, like Trump, bowed his
