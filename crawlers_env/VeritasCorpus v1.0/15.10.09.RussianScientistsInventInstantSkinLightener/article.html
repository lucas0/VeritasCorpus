  In early August 2015, several web sites published
  <a href="http://www.donotlink.com/g7n2" target="_blank">
   articles
  </a>
  with titles such as “A Russian Laboratory has invented a way to remove the black Skin layer of black People” (with the earliest iteration we’ve found being

  2015).  Nearly all the
  <a href="http://masasieharare.com/scientists-discover-way-to/" target="_blank">
   articles
  </a>
  had identical text (down to rendering errors) reporting that:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   This is unbelievable and yet real. According to a publication of the Moscow Faculty of Sciences, researchers have developed a chemical process to « whiten » quickly a person.
  </p>
  <p>
   With a mixture that includes oxytane and benzodiazepine. It would suffice to stay for 6 hours in a bath consisting of 50 grams per liter of water.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then the skin peels off naturally. This is in fact the upper skin layer responsible for the color that can be removed.
  </p>
  <p>
   The laboratory at the origin of the discovery has already announced 254 people have been treated by this method. The Russian government may soon allow the reimbursement of this treatment.

  <p>
   According to Russian authorities, is an high value for thousands of immigrants who may feel more integrated in Russia once their color matches the one of the premises.
  </p>
  <p>
   A strong point of view decried by the associations of human rights.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  The claim appeared (without obvious origin) almost simultaneously on a number of web sites of questionable repute, and the photograph that accompanied it was demonstrably misrepresented. The image was
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/vbz7z/sleep_in_the_beach/" target="_blank">
   posted

  as part of a Reddit thread titled “Sleep in the beach” published on

   circulated
  </a>
  online since then.  Early iterations never presented the picture as anything other than evidence of a sunburn (and the setting depicted was clearly not a laboratory, Russian or otherwise).

 <p>
  Most of the “skin treatment” articles claimed that
  <em>

  had recently published an article about the purported discovery, but we were unable to
  <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/search/?q=Moscow+Faculty+of+Sciences&amp;s=" target="_blank">

  </a>
  any report that even loosely matched their claims. Similarly, a Google search for “Moscow Faculty of Sciences” returned

 <p>
  Although the exact origins of this image are uncertain, it appeared at least as far back 2012 on Reddit as an image-based warning about the dangers of falling asleep at the beach (a far likelier explanation for the photograph than a demonstration of skin-whitening). An old (and clearly unrelated) image was repurposed as evidence for a  dubious medical claim.
