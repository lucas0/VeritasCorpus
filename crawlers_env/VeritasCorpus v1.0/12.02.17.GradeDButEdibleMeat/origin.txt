  Here at Indiana University there is a story that has been going around for a long time, that certainly qualifies as a FOAF story.
 </p>
 <p>
  It typically involves someone who was a student worker in the cafeteria system, who says that they saw a recently delivered crate of beef labelled:
  <nobr>
   “Grade D
  </nobr>
  Beef:  Fit for human consumption.”

  Supposedly found on a box of sausages that my university was using…
  <nobr>
   “Grade D,
  </nobr>
  but edible”.

  I’ve heard from several people that Taco Bell uses
  <nobr>
   Grade D
  </nobr>
  Edible meat in their foods (i.e. the skins, testicles, penises,
  <nobr>
   et cetera
  </nobr>
  ground up).

  I heard from a friend that Taco Bell meat is
  <nobr>
   grade F,
  </nobr>
  while most dog foods are
  <nobr>
   grade D
  </nobr>
  (a better grade).
