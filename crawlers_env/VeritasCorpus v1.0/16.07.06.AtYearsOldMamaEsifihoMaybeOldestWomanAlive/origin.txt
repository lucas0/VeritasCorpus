  We came across the pictures of a woman named Mama Efisho, who is 191 years old according a great great grandson of the woman, Mr. Avuefeyen.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to him, the woman who is about two centuries old ‘lives in Ellu (Edhemoko, Akaluba Street, Ellu in INLG) in Delta State.’
 </p>
 <p>
  While questioned on the veracity of this claim, Mr. Avufeyen claimed that that she witnessed the birth of his grandfather.
 </p>
 <p>
  If his claims are true then, Mama Efisho is most likely Nigeria’s oldest woman alive that we know of.
