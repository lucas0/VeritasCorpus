  On 13 May 2016, the entertainment web site
  <em>
   Business Standard News
  </em>
  published a fake news article reporting that television personality and controversial political pundit Ann Coulter had been arrested for using the women’s bathroom:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Business Standard News has learned that Rightwing commentator Ann Coulter has been arrested by a security officer for trying to use a women’s bathroom in Charlotte, N.C. North Carolina is facing widespread criticism and a federal lawsuit for instituting a law that would force transgender people to use the bathroom of the birth gender.
  </p>
  <p>
   Coulter was outraged at her arrest.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I can’t believe the nerve of this rent-a-cop,” she said according to The Conservative Chronicle. “He’s probably an illegal.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  There is no truth to the article quoted above. This is a piece of fiction from an entertainment web site.
  <em>

  states on its “About” page that it is “a satirical site designed to parody the 24-hour news cycle. The stories are outlandish, but reality is so strange nowadays they could be true.”
