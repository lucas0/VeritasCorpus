  In December 2015, a picture purportedly showing a dog that had been badly burned while rescuing a family from a fire started

  The above-displayed image does not show a badly burned dog. The photograph shows a dog with a piece of ham on its face. While this may seem obvious to some, several people liked and shared the above-displayed Facebook post as if it were a genuine item.

  Stephen Roseman, the Facebook user who posted the above-displayed image, admitted that the story was fake in the comment section below his post:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   People, people this isn’t even my dog, I found this picture on fascistbook, stole it, and decided to use it in a prank to fool these religitards
  </p>
  <p>
   So I did, and low and behold idiots left and right fall for it, and those that didn’t, seem to think they have a superior intelligence or something, for pointing out the obvious
  </p>
  <p>
   Keep in mind, I never told a single soul to like this, that is their choice, I don’t give a f*ck either way.
  </p>

  The image, in other words, was initially shared specifically to poke fun at both the people who tend to share “1 like = 1 prayer” messages on social media sites, and the people who would subsequently point out that it was a joke.
