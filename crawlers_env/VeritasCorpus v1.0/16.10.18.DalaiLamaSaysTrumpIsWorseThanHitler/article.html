  On 14 October 2016, the “THEIST VS ATHEIST” blog at religiousmind.com posted an entry asserting that His Holiness, the 14th Dalai Lama, had proclaimed Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump to be “worse than Hitler” and a “threat to humanity”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Dalai Lama says Trump shows psychopathic behaviors which are similar to that of Hilter [sic]. He made this statement in Zurich when he met 6500 Tibetans in Switzerland.
  </p>
  <p>
   Speaking to media after a grand offering ceremony organized by Tibetan community in Switzerland, he made several comments on world politics including sovereignty of  Tibetan lands from Chinese rule.
  </p>
  <p>
   When asked what he thinks of American politics where he has special interest he said “I see another Hitler in the making”. He further added that Trump is a great threat to humanity.
  </p>
  <p>
   “If American people vote for Trump, it will be the end of great Amarican [sic] civilization”  he said.
