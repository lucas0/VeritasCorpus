  OK, there are a lot of people at work saying that at some time Hillary Clinton said that nurses pay is way too high and that they are just glorified baby sitters. Has any one else heard this. I’ve looked at may sights on her and can’t find it. If she did say that, it needs to be made known. Nurses are a large voting population. I hope for her sake she didn’t say that. Is that part of her medical reform plan?
