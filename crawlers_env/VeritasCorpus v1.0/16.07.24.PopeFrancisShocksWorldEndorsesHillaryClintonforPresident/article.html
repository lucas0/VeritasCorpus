   News outlets around the world are reporting on the news that Pope Francis has made the unprecedented decision to endorse a US presidential candidate. His statement in support of Hillary Clinton was released from the Vatican this evening:
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    “I have been hesitant to offer any kind of support for either candidate in the US presidential election but I now feel that to not voice my concern would be a dereliction of my duty as the Holy See. A strong and free America is vitally important in maintaining a strong and free world and in that sense what happens in American elections affects us all.  With that at the forefront of my mind I must express my strong reservations about Mr. Donald Trump.  His demeanor and temperament should preclude him from becoming President.  I fear he may be disastrous to the security, stability, and prosperity of the United States and to the world.  I believe that Secretary Clinton would be a better, more stable choice.  Though I don’t agree with Secretary Clinton on some issues I’m asking, not as the Holy Father, but as a concerned citizen of the world that Americans vote for Hillary Clinton for President of the United States.”
