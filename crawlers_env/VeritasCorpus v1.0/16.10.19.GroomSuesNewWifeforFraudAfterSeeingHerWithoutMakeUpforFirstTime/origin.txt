 <p>
  A man who saw his new wife for the first time without make up is reportedly SUING her for trauma, after being shocked at her appearance.
 </p>
 <p>
  The unnamed couple had just got married in Algeria and after spending the night together, the husband woke up to find his wife bare faced.
 </p>
 <p>
  But rather than admire her natural beauty, instead the man REFUSED to believe the woman was his wife, believing her to be a thief.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally realising that this was in fact the woman he loved, the man is now allegedly suing her for fraud and “psychological suffering”.
