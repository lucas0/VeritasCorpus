  Andrea Benenacci, the mother of a 16-year-old teenager who recently received a flu shot at San Francisco General Hospital, is suing the hospital after she noticed extreme changes in her son’s sexual preferences.
 </p>
 <p>
  The single mother of two blames the hospital for giving her son a vaccine shot which allegedly has made him queer.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My son was perfectly normal before the shot” she told reporters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Medical specialist Frank Weishberg claims he has observed a progression in similar claims in the past decade.
 </p>
 <p>
  “In my 40 years of research on male health relating to problems of the male reproductive system, I have been witness to at least a hundred similar cases only in the past decade, with a large amount in the San Francisco Bay area, which is extremely atypical,” he admits.
