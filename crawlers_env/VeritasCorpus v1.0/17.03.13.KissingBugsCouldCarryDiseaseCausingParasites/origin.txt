  Is the barber beetle dangerous even causing fatality with its bite while you sleep?

  Looking for info on a bug named the Barber Beetle. The Pink Penguin website states that this bug can infect one with a parasite and the parasite carries the Chagas disease. Website states you must kill the bug and if you don’t you need to call an exterminator immediately. Sound like an African bug if nothing else. Have several friends who never check out what they are sharing, rely on your site a lot. Thank you.

  Read an article about a bug that sounds to be the new insect of the plague. Aids is the similar disease this “Insect” supposedly spreads through its bite. Chagas and Trypanosome were the diseases also known to be spread. Is this real?
