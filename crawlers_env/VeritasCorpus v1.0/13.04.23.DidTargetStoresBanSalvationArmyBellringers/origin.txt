  Target has decided to NOT allow the Salvation Army to ring the bell for the holiday season. I love the bell ringers and what they stand for. Each person gives up their time to collect money for the needy. The holiday season is the perfect time to remind us to share our blessings with others. I try to give something to each bell ringer, no matter how small I know the Salvation Army will put it to good use.

  Target announced this week that Salvation Army bell-ringers will no longer be allowed in front of their stores during the holiday season. The retailer tells

  Eyewitness News, “…Like many nationwide retailers, Target Corporation has a long standing no solicitation policy that must be applied across all of its stores.” The Lancaster County Salvation Army says there’s no hard feelings, just a rethinking of ways to keep the kettles out and the bells ringing. Nearly a quarter of all donations came from Lincoln’s two Target stores. Last year, the Lincoln/Lancaster County Salvation Army raised more than a
  <nobr>
   120-thousand
  </nobr>
  dollars during their kettle drive.

  The Salvation Army will not be allowed to have their bell-ringers and kettles outside Target stores this Christmas season.  I can’t think of a better example of the joy of Christmas than the work of The Salvation Army.

  Founded in 1865 as a religious and charitable mission, it provided over

   $2.5 billion

  Three years ago Wal-Mart restricted soliciting by the Salvation Army &amp; others to

  collection site for the Salvation Army, with

  My response is to make Target a “target” to avoid, and when I see the bell-ringers from the Salvation Army at other stores to drop in a little more and tell them that is my contribution for Target.

 <p>
  If you agree, please pass this on.

  P. S. Target says they give over $67 million per years to various worthy causes — one of them being sending drops to the contestants of the show

   “Survivor” — a
