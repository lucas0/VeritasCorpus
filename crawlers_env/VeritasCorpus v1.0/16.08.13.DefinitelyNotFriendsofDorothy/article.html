  The history of race relations in America includes many (unfortunately true) tales of black entertainers and athletes whose talents were avidly capitalized upon and enjoyed by white business people and audiences, while they themselves were treated as second-class citizens.  Considered good enough to entertain millions of white Americans on ball fields and stages throughout the country, far too often these performers were nonetheless not considered good enough to share lodgings, restaurants, or recreational facilities with whites and had to make do with (typically far inferior) separate accommodations.  And black customers who paid to see these performers were usually treated in like fashion, relegated to sitting in segregated (and less desirable) sections of the audience — if they were allowed to attend at all.

  Perhaps nowhere was this disparity symbolized more  than in the gambling mecca of Las Vegas, where black entertainers (primarily singers) regularly entertained casino and resort guests in hotel showrooms and lounges, but oftimes weren’t allowed to stay in those very same hotels, or eat in their restaurants.  Black entertainers weren’t even welcomed as casino patrons, as sportswriter Roger Kahn documented when budding baseball superstar Willie Mays of the New York Giants was booted from a Vegas casino floor for the offense of “standing while black”:

 <blockquote>

   No one on the club was ready for an ugly incident that marred an exhibition-game trip to Las Vegas. After the game, in which the Giants beat the Indians again, the team was invited to visit one of the casinos for food and entertainment on the house. Mays took in a show with Roger Kahn, then wandered over to the dice tables, where he stood quietly watching the game. Suddenly a thuggish security man accosted Kahn, saying, “Get your friend away from the dice tables. We don’t want him mixing with the white guests.”

   Kahn was indignant. The casino had asked Mays and the team to come in, after all. “Do you know who he is?” Kahn demanded.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Yeah. I know who he is,” said the security man. “He’s a nigger. Get that nigger away from the white guests.”
