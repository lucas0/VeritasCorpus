  On 11 October 2016, the right-wing blog Liberty Writers posted a story, apparently in response to a
  <em>
   New York Times
  </em>
  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/us/politics/early-voting-registration.html" target="_blank">
   report
  </a>
  indicating that Hillary Clinton was leading early voting underway in Florida, claiming that Republican nominee Donald Trump drew a huge crowd at a rally at the Aaron Bessant Park in Panama City, Florida:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Political pundits want you to believe that Trump has already lost this election. Just today, the liberal media announced that Trump lost his chances in Florida. They claim that Florida is now a blue state and Hillary will win for sure.
  </p>
  <p>
   It looks like Florida voters disagree.
  </p>
  <p>
   Trump held a rally in Panama City Beach Florida and brought in a crowd no one could believe!
  </p>
  <p>
   The rally was held at Aaron Bessant Park, a location with a maximum capacity of 7,500 people.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Trump stepped on stage he greeted 30,000 supporters chanting his name!!!
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The web site then posted a photograph it claimed was a “bird’s eye view” of the rally. But the picture actually captured a jazz festival held at the same venue back in 2013:
