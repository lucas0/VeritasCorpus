  Political pundits want you to believe that Trump has already lost this election. Just today, the liberal media announced that Trump lost his chances in Florida. They claim that Florida is now a blue state and Hillary will win for sure.

  It looks like Florida voters disagree.

  Trump held a rally in Panama City Beach Florida and brought in a crowd no one could believe!
 </p>
 <p>
  The rally was held at Aaron Bessant Park, a location with a maximum capacity of 7,500 people.

  When Trump stepped on stage he greeted 30,000 supporters chanting his name!!!
