  Actor Scott Baio, 56, is alive and well, despite a 29 May 2017 report that
  <a href="http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-scott-baio-killed-in-small-plane-crash-on-his-way-to-mar-a-lago/" target="_blank">
   originated
  </a>
  on the web site Last Line of Defense to the effect that he was killed in a plane crash on his way to visit President Trump in Mar-a-Lago, Florida:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Chachi can now apologize to Joannie for being so rude. Scott Baio, 56, was killed when the single-engine Cessna he was in crashed into the side of a hill in Louisiana. Baio was headed to Mar-A-Lago to barbecue shrimp and play gold [sic] with President Trump.
  </p>
  <p>
   Baio’s wife, Raylene, wasn’t on the plane but was checked into St Timothy’s on a suicide watch after the news sent her into a breakdown. Spokesmen for several actors who wouldn’t be caught dead in a film with Baio said that he was “really special as Chachi” and he “sure did do a nice job with Charles in Charge.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  We assume that the phrase “play gold with President Trump” is a typo, and that the author intended to write “play golf with President Trump.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Not that the detail matters, given that Last Line of Defense is a well-known purveyor of fake news and the entire story is a work of fiction. As stated in the web site’s
