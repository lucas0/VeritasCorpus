  On 6 June 2017, the World News Daily Report (WNDR) web site published an article positing that an Iraqi terrorist was killed when hand grenades he was attempting to smuggle by hiding them in his rectum accidentally detonated:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   An Iraqi terrorist who tried to smuggle two grenades in his backside at Baghdad International Airport was apprehended and left to die from his wounds 2 km outside of the airport reports the Iraqi Times.
  </p>
  <p>
   The terrorist warned airport authorities himself claiming he was in agonizing pain after he had hidden two grenades in his rectum and had planned to blow up a plane.
  </p>
  <p>
   An Iraqi bomb squad rapidly evacuated the man in the back of a pickup truck and brought him 2 km outside of the airport, in the middle of the desert, and out of “harm’s way” declared officials.

  There was no truth to this story, which originated solely with  World News Daily Report, a fake news site whose disclaimer notes that WNDR’s content is “satirical” and “fictional”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>

All characters appearing in the articles in this website – even those based on real people –  are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.

  The photograph of the supposed “Iraqi terrorist” is a manipulated version of an image taken from a 2016
