  On 31 December 2016, the Empire News web site published an
  <a href="http://archive.is/F4RhU" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  reporting that outgoing President Barack Obama had ordered a life-sized bronze statue of himself to be permanently installed at the White House:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   President Obama has ordered a $200,000, life-sized, bronze statue of himself, with plans to install it in the entryway of the White House. The president says that his legacy “should not be diminished,” and that this is the only way he can “keep an eye” over Trump, as well as future presidents.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I have been president for only eight years, and in that time, I have done what no other presidents could do in all their time in total,” said Obama. “I have created a legacy that should not be diminished. I have created something that no future president will be able to do. In that regard, I have commissioned this statute, with plans to have it permanently erected in the entryway of the White House, so that all who enter can remember me fondly.”

  The statue seen above is real, but it was not placed or photographed inside the Oval Office. The statue was actually

   installed

  It appears that the hoaxsters combined a
