 <p>
  The Woodland Town Council rejected a proposal to rezone a section of land north of town to M2 (manufacturing) from RA (residential/agricultural), essentially denying approval of a solar farm … Later in the meeting, the Town Council voted for a complete moratorium on solar farms.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   During the public comment period
  </strong>
  preceding the rezoning vote,
  <strong>
   citizens expressed distrust and fear
  </strong>
  of the solar panels.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Mary Hobbs has been living in Woodland for 50 years and said she has watched it slowly becoming a ghost town with no job opportunities for young people.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   She said her home is surrounded by solar farms and is no longer worth its value because of those facilities.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  She added that the only people profiting are the landowners who sell their land, the solar companies, and the electrical companies.
