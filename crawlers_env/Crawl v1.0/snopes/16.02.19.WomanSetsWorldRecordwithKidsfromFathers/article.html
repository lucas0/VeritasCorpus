  On 17 February 2016, the entertainment web site
  <em>
   World News Daily Report
  </em>
  published a fake news article claiming that a Detroit woman set a new world record by having fourteen children with fourteen different fathers:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   According to the internationally recognized authority on the cataloguing and verification of world records, Anita Sullivan has just become the first woman in recorded history to conceive children with more than thirteen different men.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I’m extremely proud to have broken a World Record,” Ms. Sullivan told reporters.“My mother always told me that I was lazy and worthless, and that I would never accomplish anything in my life. Now, I’ve shown everyone that she was wrong, and that I can even be the best in the world when I put my mind to something. In fact, I’ve just accomplished something that no one had done before!”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  There is no truth to the above-quoted story.
  <em>
   The World News Daily Report
  </em>
  is an entertainment web site, and does not publish factual stories:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   WNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website – even those based on real people –  are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.

 <p>
  <em>
   World News Daily Report
  </em>
  also used an unrelated photo in an attempt to trick its readers:

  The above-displayed image doesn’t show this fictional woman’s children. It is a

  photo of children, presumably from different families.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, it appears that
  <i>
   World News Net Daily
  </i>
  just lifted the photo from a

  in the
  <em>
   Milford Mirror
  </em>
  about a new mother who had given birth to the first baby of 2015 in Milford, Connecticut:

  Another fake news clickbait site,
  <em>
   TMZ World News
  </em>
  , uses the same headline, language, and quotes, but a different photo and name (perhaps in an attempt to lend authenticity to a story that is equally fake).  The photo on this version was stolen from another “first baby of the year”
