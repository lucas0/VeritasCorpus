 <p>
  RIGHT HERE IN MO !
 </p>
 <p>
  SPIDERS HAVE BEEN RELEASED FROM A DNA LABORATORY LOCATED NEAR THE WOLF SANCTUARY ON ANTIRE RD !
 </p>
 <p>
  Government testing on DNA has produced these spiders in a Laboratory in Missouri. Unfortunately they have been located off Lewis Rd just west of laboratory and seem to be breading in the wild much faster than when captive.
 </p>
 <p>
  Government officials are doing all they can to try to eliminate these spiders but can offer no guarantees. They could be popping up in surrounding neighborhoods west of the siting (Eureka, Pacific, Union, and
  <nobr>
   St. Clair)
  </nobr>
  within weeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  What we have in our favor is that winter is approaching and hope to slow down the migration no further than
  <nobr>
   St. Clair
  </nobr>
  before the cold hits.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you see these stay indoors and call the local police. They have been informed on procedures of capture and contact of the local governing agency.
