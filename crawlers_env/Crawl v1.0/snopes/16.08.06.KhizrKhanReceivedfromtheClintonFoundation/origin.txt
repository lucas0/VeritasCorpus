  Well now with some help from a member of the awesome freedom fighter group Anonymous, we have some more interesting information about Mr. Khan and his unethical connection with Crooked Hillary and her charitable money laundering foundation–did we say that?
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to litigation concerns [no doubt a lawsuit is forthcoming – screw you Khan] we are not going to make other comments than to use your own imagination what this payment is for.  We will open up comments so that you can discuss this matter among yourselves.

  “Hey girl, we have been monitoring one of several bank accounts for Khan’s law firms.  Attached, please take a hard look at the payment from Clinton’s foundation to Khan’s law firm.  Should not take a MBA to figure what he was paid for.  Enjoy.”
