  When you like a page guilty of like-farming, the posts show up in your newsfeed. The goal of the page is to get as many likes as possible, because more likes equals more exposure. When you interact—simply clicking like on a photo of a puppy or kitten—your activity shows up in your friends’ feeds. And then they spread it to their friends. At this point, the page is gaining traction in the Facebook algorithm and becoming more popular and visible…

  … The big question is why? And there’s a reason. Money. Have you noticed that once you see these pages you don’t usually see them again? That’s because they are sold, stripped and get a new name—but they already have all of these likes in place. Facebook doesn’t allow this, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen. Sadly, you are helping.
