  On 29 December 2015, the web site
  <em>
   Hot Global News
  </em>
  published an article reporting that Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau had banned U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump from entering Canada:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In a meeting held by the Liberal party earlier this week, party leader and Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau called for the prohibition of Donald Trump from entering Canada effective immediately for as long until Trump publicly apologize for his racist comments against Muslims and Mexicans.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Canada is a free country. Canada is a country that supports all ethnic backgrounds, all cultures and all religions. Donald Trump’s speeches have demonstrated his hate towards Muslims and Mexicans. Canada does not tolerate racism or hate. Donald Trump is here by banned from entering Canada for as long as he wishes to show his racism.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  However, this story was nothing more a work of fiction from
  <em>
   Hot Global News
  </em>
  a site that clearly states in its disclaimer that it is a satire (i.e., fake news) publication and does not publish factual stories:

  While Prime Minister Trudeau has not banned Donald Trump from entering Canada, he did say that he strongly disagreed with the GOP candidate’s plan to bar Muslims from entering the United States. Shortly after
