  How much do you love Tom Hanks? This abundantly talented, deeply charming actor has been thrilling audiences and moving them to tears for more than three decades now. He’s earned the trust of Americans as a decent, grounded person with a great deal of humanity and common sense. In the snake pit that is Hollywood and the liberal media, he is a beacon of decency.
 </p>
 <p>
  So it will likely not surprise you to learn to learn which candidate Hanks plans to vote for in November: Republican nominee Donald Trump.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like Trump, Tom Hanks believes in our country. That’s why he’s dedicated himself to producing TV series and films that honor the great achievements of our forefathers, such as the award-winning
  <em>
   Band of Brothers
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Pacific
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Like many of us, he’s concerned about the state of our country after all the damage Barack Obama has caused it. But he has an unwavering belief in our country’s ability to bounce back, especially under the visionary leadership of a President like Trump.
