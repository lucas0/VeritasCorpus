  I know john personally! THIS IS LEGIT! The photo was taken at a protest 5/1/10 in Phoenix!

  I for one am OUTRAGED by this photo, taken the next day after a Pinal County Sheriffs Deputy was shot by Mexican Drug Runners with an AK-47 just a few miles from my home. THIS CRAP IS TAKING PLACE “IN MY BACKYARD”! YOU PEOPLE in other states Need to shut the hell up, and actuall READ THE PROPOSED LAW for yourselves, and NOT LISTEN TO THE RACEBAITERS like Sharpton and OBAMA! READ IT FOR YOURSELF THEN DECIDE IF IT IS RIGHT OR WRONG
 </p>
 <p>
  I have about had enough.

  Picture taken by one of my friends in Phoenix yesterday when all the illegals were protesting. This is shocking! Just keep poking us with those sticks, you bastards. We’re fed up.
