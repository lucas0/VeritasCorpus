    <li>
     Chariot flips over as it rounds a turn, driver spills out.  Easily performed by stuntman.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>
     After Messala rips the wheels of a chariot, the driver is dragged behind the horses.  He then turns to face the oncoming chariots, leaps out of the way of one, and then is run over by a second.  The camera cuts away from an obviously live stunt man, to a posed dummy which gets flattened.  Many people point to this as the fatal accident.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>
     Ben Hur (Heston) avoids Messala and makes another chariot crash into the wall, dumping the driver.  Another easily performed stunt.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>
     Messala forces one chariot into another, both pile up into wall.  Horses fall in typical trip-wire fashion.
    </li>

    <li>
     Roman soldier standing along wall pitches forward as one chariot passes, is run over by second.  This gag has been labeled fatal.  When you go through it in slow motion, note that the body’s legs remain straight even after being trampled.  Note particularly that the feet remain perpendicular to the legs.  This is obviously a dummy.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>
     Ben-Hur is pinned against wall and must leap the two chariots that crashed in [4.] above.  This is the incident in which Canutt is pitched forward and receives a minor cut to his chin.  Although this was the only stunt that was very nearly serious, it is rarely suggested that this was the fatal accident.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>
     Messala’s chariot disintegrates, and he is pitched out, dragged behind, and finally trampled by the horses of another chariot.  Going through this in slow motion, you can clearly see that the figure pitched out of the chariot, dragged and trampled is a dummy.  A close-up of Stephen Boyd being dragged is cut into the sequence, but the distance shots are all done with a stiff figure. This is where many people erroneously feel an accident occurred.
