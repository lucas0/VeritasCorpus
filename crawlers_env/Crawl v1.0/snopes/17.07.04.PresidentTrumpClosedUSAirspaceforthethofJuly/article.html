  an article reporting that President Donald Trump had grounded all flights in the United States in honor of Independence Day:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Calling it a ‘monumental achievement for both patriotism and transportation’, President Donald Trump announced on Monday that the entire National Airspace System of the United States would be closed to all flights on Independence Day. Amidst hostility already brewing from a week of controversial Twitter posts, Donald Trump took to a more conservative approach to announce the news: an e-mail to airline executives.
  </p>
  <p>
   “In an effort to increase the public’s awareness of the Fourth of July Independence Day holiday, and in an effort to boost an industry I deem to be unfake [sic], all commercial aircraft to, from, and within the United States are to be grounded on Tuesday,” the e-mail stated.
  </p>
  <p>
   It went onto mention other rather curious topics: a brief history of American innovation in aviation, the benefits of a more isolated approach to globalism, favorite foods of the president, and finally, why he would have mentioned all of this on Twitter, but his advisors told him not to, and in fact later changed his password. After a 7-paragraph regression analysis on why password requirements are unnecessary, the e-mail then seems to collectively wish people a happy 4th of July, before trailing off in a strange tirade about CNN.

  In addition to the dubious source of the story, its false status was given away by live flight tracking web sites such as

  that showed numerous planes criss-crossing over the United States on 4 July 2017.
