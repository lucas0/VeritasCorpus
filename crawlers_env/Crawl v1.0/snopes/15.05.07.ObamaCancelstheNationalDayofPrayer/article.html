  The United States has observed many unofficial national days of prayer throughout its history until 1952, when President Harry S. Truman signed a bill proclaiming a National Day of Prayer (“on which the people of the United States may turn to God in prayer and meditation at churches, in groups, and as individuals”). This bill did not establish a specific calendar date for the event, but left it up to each president to designate a date of his choosing. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan fixed the date of the National Day of Prayer as the first Thursday of May.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 2009 (and every year since), rumors were circulated claiming that President Barack Obama had “canceled” that year’s National Day of Prayer. These claims were false and were based on a misunderstanding of the nature of the National Day of Prayer and the role of the President of the United States in its observation.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is no official ceremony (presidential or otherwise) prescribed for the observance of the National Day of Prayer: it is a day on which the people of the U.S. are called upon “to turn to God in prayer and meditation,” however they choose to do so. President Obama opted to issue the traditional

  ) while observing the occasion privately:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “Prayer is something that the president does every day,” said White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs. Adding that Obama would sign a proclamation to recognize the day. “I think the president understands, in his own life and in his family’s life, the role that prayer plays. And I would denote that the administrations prior to the past one did proclamations. That’s the way the president will publicly observe the national prayer day. But, as I said, privately, he’ll pray as he does every day.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Other observances of the National Day of Prayer in the nation’s capital have also continued throughout President Obama’s administration, with the

  <a href="http://www.nationaldayofprayer.org/watch_national_observance_live" target="_blank">

  events streamed live online from the Cannon House Office Building on Capitol Hill.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it is true that President Obama has so far chosen not to host an ecumenical service in the East Room of the White House in observance of the National Day of Prayer as his predecessor, President George W. Bush, did each year throughout his tenure in office, that service was a personal preference of President Bush; it was neither an official ceremony prescribed by the bill that established the National Day of Prayer nor a long-standing presidential tradition. In fact, George W. Bush was the
  <u>
   only
  </u>
  president who ever regularly organized White House events in observance that day: President Ronald Reagan hosted only one throughout his eight years in office (a 1982 Rose Garden event), President George H.W. Bush also hosted only one during his four years in office (a 1989 State Dining Room breakfast), and President Bill Clinton hosted none at all in the course of his eight-year presidency. Claims that President Obama has “cancelled” the National Day of Prayer because he has so far opted not to hold a public prayer ceremony in observance of the occasion are therefore akin to asserting that Independence Day was “canceled” if a president chose not to attend a fireworks show on the 4th of July.
 </p>
 <p>
  The status of the National Day of Prayer became uncertain on 15 April 2010 when a federal judge ruled in favor of a challenge brought by the Freedom from Religion Foundation and held that the National Day of Prayer was unconstitutional. The Obama administration was actually the
  <a href="http://ffrf.org/uploads/legal/SummaryJudgementGeitner.PDF" target="_blank">
   defendant
  </a>
  in that suit, arguing in favor of retaining the National Day of Prayer:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   President Barack Obama, who is charged with enforcing the statute by issuing a proclamation each year, and his press secretary, Robert Gibbs, contend that the statute is simply an “acknowledgment of the role of religion in American life” and is indistinguishable from government practices that courts have upheld in the past.
  </p>
  <p>
   U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb says her order does not block any prayer day until after appeals in the case are exhausted.
  </p>
  <p>
   White House spokesman Matt Lehrich said that the ruling therefore doesn’t prevent Obama from issuing a Day of Prayer proclamation in May and that the president will do so.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The Obama administration appealed the ruling, and in April 2011 it was overturned by a three-judge panel of the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago, who decreed that the Freedom from Religion Foundation and its plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the National Day of Prayer.

  A December 2009 version of this item offered a photograph purportedly documenting President Obama’s participation in an “Islamic Prayer Day” observance at the White House:
