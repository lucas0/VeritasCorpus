<blockquote>
 <p>
  One day an explorer is out in the jungle. As he wanders along, he comes upon an elephant, crying with pain, a large thorn lodged in its foot. Feeling sorry for the elephant, the man carefully pulls out the thorn. The elephant looks at him gratefully, then limps off into the jungle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many years later, the same man visits a circus, and sits in the front row. The elephant acts come on, but one of the elephants keeps looking over at the explorer. Eventually, the elephant breaks free, runs over to
  <nobr>
   him …
  </nobr>
  then picks the man up with his trunk, dashes him to the ground, and tramples him to death with his mighty feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why did the elephant do this?
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t the same elephant.
