   The new bill includes a portrait of the middle-aged Confederate general on its face while the reverse side features a scene depicting the Second Battle of Bull Run. “We are pleased to announce that the new twenty-dollar bill will make its debut on Monday, September 11th, in eleven states, including South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Virginia, Alabama, and Texas,” Treasury spokesperson Keith Davis announced during a press conference Tuesday morning.

  The article is entirely false and appears to be intended to be read as satire, appearing within the context of a national debate about the removal of Confederate memorials from public spaces across the United States. The “

  On 11 and 12 August 2017, a white supremacist protest against the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee from a park in Charlottesville, Virginia erupted into violence, culminating in the murder by car of counterprotester Heather Heyer and intensifying public debate over Confederate symbols.
