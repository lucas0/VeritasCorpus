  A persistent rumor that has been attached to Hillary Clinton for many years now, holding that sometime in the 1990s she made a disparaging remark about nurses. Although this rumor has been
  <a href="http://message.snopes.com/showthread.php?t=18867" target="_blank">
   circulating
  </a>
  for at least a decade now, concrete information about what she actually said, when she said it, or how the public was made aware of the comment has still not come to light.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rumor generally asserts that at sometime indefinite place and time, Hillary Clinton allegedly referred to nurses as “glorified baby sitters” or “”under-educated, overpaid maids.”  For example, on 6 February 2008 a user posted a

   message
  </a>
  to the AllNurses forum inquiring about the former:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   OK, there are a lot of people at work saying that at some time Hillary Clinton said that nurses pay is way too high and that they are just glorified baby sitters. Has any one else heard this. I’ve looked at may sights on her and can’t find it. If she did say that, it needs to be made known. Nurses are a large voting population. I hope for her sake she didn’t say that. Is that part of her medical reform plan?

  , many users responded by asserting that they distinctly remembered Clinton’s making such a remark but could offer nothing documenting the event — attributing the lack of evidence to Clinton’s statement’s supposedly having been made before Internet usage became widespread:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   OK people, I have done my searching. (sorry it took so long, back to school) I was told by the people I went to for this information that because it was said, or rumored back in 1993, the level of information of that type was limited in cyberspace, so it will remain a rumor with no substantiated documentation

  When a similar rumor was

   mentioned
  </a>
  in the same forum in July 2016, this time holding that Clinton had called nurses “overpaid” and “nothing but doctor’s handmaidens,” users again explained away the lack of evidence by asserting that this statement was made before “everything [was] documented online”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Some of us are old enough to remember what many in the media choose to forget. (Believe it or not, not everything is documented online). Shortly after Bill Clinton was elected President, Hillary did indeed say that nurses were overpaid and were nothing but doctor’s handmaidens.
