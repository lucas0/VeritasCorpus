  On 17 March 2017, the web site known as The Resistance: America’s Last Line of Defense (aka “The Resistance: Twisted News for Conservative Minds”) posted an article positing that controversial American civil rights activist Al Sharpton was gunned down in Chicago by members of a “domestic terrorist group”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The city morgue in Chicago is on lockdown after a black male matching Reverand Al Sharpton’s description became the latest victim of gun violence in Chicago. The local police have confirmed that a man was murdered outside of Sharpton’s home and that two men have been apprehended and charged with first-degree murder.
  </p>
  <p>
   No further information is available other than the fact that the two men in custody are members of a domestic terrorist group. The group hasn’t yet been identified, but since black on black violence in Chicago is so common, it seems likely that this won’t be something liberals will be able to blame on “white privilege.”

 <p>
  There was no truth to this story. The Rev. Al Sharpton is still alive (and

  the policies of President Donald Trump), and reports of his murder originated with the America’s Last Line of Defense fake news web site, whose disclaimer identifies the site’s content as satirical:
