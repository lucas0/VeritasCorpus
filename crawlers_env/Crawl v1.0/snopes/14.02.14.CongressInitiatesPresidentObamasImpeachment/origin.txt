<blockquote>
 <p>
  A group of House Republicans is pushing a resolution to bring legal action against President Barack Obama for overstepping his authority in executive orders.
 </p>
 <p>
  The STOP (Stop This Overreaching Presidency) resolution, sponsored by
  <nobr>
   Rep. Tom
  </nobr>
  Rice, targets Obama for allowing a year extension health care policies that were ended because of Obamacare; delaying the employer mandate for one year; deferring the deportation of illegal immigrants brought to the country as children and waiving part of the welfare work requirement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rice said he’s spoken with the House GOP leadership about the resolution — which would be
  <nobr>
   non-binding
  </nobr>
  if it ever advanced, and wouldn’t need Senate approval — and a hearing is being scheduled in both the Judiciary and Administration Committees.
 </p>
 <p>
  The resolution has 74 Republican cosponsors, ranging from the more conservative to moderate members. Rice held a press conference to announce it with
  <nobr>
   12 other
  </nobr>
  Republicans.
