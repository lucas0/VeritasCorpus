  [John] Dale had laid a wager that he would fill Wood’s belly with good wholesome victuals for two shillings, and a gentleman that laid the contrary did wager that as soon as noble Nick had eaten out Dale’s two shillings, that he should presently enter combat with a worthy knight called Sir Loin of Beef, and overthrow him.
