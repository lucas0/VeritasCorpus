  A disturbing video purporting to show a prostitute still attached at the genitals to an elderly man who died while having sex has emerged online.
 </p>
 <p>
  The pair are hidden under a blanket, but the woman does seem to be moving, as a crowd of people stand around and watch in horror.

  The video appears to have first emerged on Chinese video sharing website Miaopai, before it was later shared by users on LiveLeak.

 <p>
  It is believed that the incident took place in China, although the exact location is unknown.
 </p>
 <p>
  The duo were presumably taken to the hospital to be surgically separated before the man could then be brought to the morgue.

  People are able to get stuck together while having intercourse — a rare occurrence known as ‘penis captivus’, where the vagina muscles clamp down on the penis much more firmly than usual.
