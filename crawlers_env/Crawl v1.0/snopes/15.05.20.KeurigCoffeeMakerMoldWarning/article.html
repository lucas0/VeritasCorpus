   article
  </a>
  (later aggregated to several other sources) titled “Why I Kicked My Keurig to the Curb” was published to the alternative health site
  <em>
   Underground Health
  </em>
  . In it, the author made a case against the use of Keurig coffee makers and their proprietary
  <nobr>
   “K-cup”
  </nobr>
  grounds packets for a number of reasons. Most compelling to many readers was a short segue into the issue of mold, bacteria, and algae growth in Keurig brewers.
 </p>
 <p>
  The author discussed several of her gripes with the Keurig system, questioning whether the cups were imbued with toxins, whether the coffee in
  <nobr>
   K-cups
  </nobr>
  was fresh, and (oddly) whether the matter of numb and tingly lips was linked with Keurig-brewed coffee. However, of all complaints listed, the one about Keurigs and mold was of the greatest concern to readers.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to the author, part of the specific issue with Keurigs and mold related to the impossibility of cleaning those machines:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Keurig.com states, “Once your Keurig home brewer has been primed, you cannot empty the water from the inside. The internal tank of the brewer cannot be drained.”
  </p>
  <p>
   The rubber tubing and the internal tank of the Keurig cannot be drained. It is possible that bacteria and mold are happily living inside that hidden water tank where it is nice and dark and warm. Another mold-magnet is that black rubber ring on the bottom of the exterior water container. Look now! Is there green or black slime? ewwwww (biofilm!).
  </p>

   Donna Duberg, M.A., M.S., an assistant professor of clinical laboratory science at Saint Louis University said, “Bacteria forms a slick biofilm when grown in moist, dark places, and so do molds.”
  </p>
  <p>
   No, your coffee bean’s antibacterial action is not enough to kill these microbes that are floating through the system. Duberg said, “There is research which shows that it is only about
   <nobr>
    50 percent
   </nobr>
   effective in killing bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans, and molds.”
