  The photograph of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and a Paas-branded Easter bunny is authentic, as is the image of First Lady Michelle Obama and a non-branded Easter bunny.

  A spokesman for Paas told us that the company has been involved with the White House egg roll for over 20 years and that the Paas bunny frequently makes an appearance:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
