  To those who have not witnessed the spectacle themselves (or have merely viewed photographs of it with no explanatory context), the sight of hundreds of Muslims praying in the middle of Manhattan’s streets is likely a startling image. Although the pictures are real, they depict a phenomenon that has been taking place regularly for many years and long antedates the presidency of Barack Obama.

   This is an accurate picture of every Friday afternoon in several locations throughout NYC where there are mosques with a large
   <br>
    number of Muslims that cannot fit into the mosque – They fill the surrounding streets, facing east for a couple of hours between
    <br/>
    about 2 &amp; 4 p.m. – Besides this one at 42nd St &amp; Madison Ave, there is another, even larger group, at 94th St &amp; 3rd Ave, etc., etc. – Also, I presume, you are aware of the dispute over building another “high rise” Mosque a few blocks from “ground zero” – With regard to that one, the “Imam” refuses to disclose where the $110 million dollars to build it is coming from and there is a lawsuit filed to force disclosure of that information – November can’t come soon enough
   </br>

  <p>
   This is in New York City on Madison Avenue, not in France or the Middle East or Yemen or Kenya.

   Is there a message here???? Yes, there is, and they are claiming America for Allah. If we don’t wake up soon, we are going to “politically correct” ourselves right out of our own country!
  </p>
  <p>
   A Christian Nation cannot put up a Christmas scene of the baby Jesus in a public place, but the Muslims can stop normal traffic every Friday afternoon by worshiping in the streets…. Something is happening in America that is reminiscent of what is happening in Europe. This is Political Correctness gone crazy…

  These photos originated with New York City’s annual American
  <a href="http://www.muslimdayparade.com/" target="_blank">
   Muslim Day Parade
  </a>
  , an event first held in 1985 (long before Barack Obama entered the world of politics) and every year since. As the parade’s organizers note of its history:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   New York City is the capital of the world and center of center of economic, business, social and cultural activities. When it comes to social and cultural activities, it houses many ethnic groups from around the world such as Irish, Italian, Latin, Afro-American, Catholic, Jewish and Muslim. Up until 1985, all these groups were celebrating their ethic and cultural heritage in one form or the other, which included street activities, festivals and parades, with the exception of the Muslims.So, in 1984, a few Muslim brothers got together, thought that when there are so many cultural shows and parades are being held in the City then Muslims should also demonstrate their different cultural beauties along with our Islamic values. Muslim representation in the City and State was zero. So they planned about having a United American Muslim Day Parade in New York City which will provide a platform to the Muslim community in this Tri-State area to get together and join the main stream political arena of this country as we have adopted it as our homeland. We are here for good; our children have to carry on our Islamic Values in the future when we will be gone.
  </p>
  <p>
   Late Zakaullah Pirzada, late Imam Qasim Bakiruddin, late Dr. Abdul Quddus, Br. Mohammad A Munim, Dr. Shafi Bezar, Dr. Rashid Jafar and many others were the founding members who organized and incorporated the Muslim Foundation of America, Inc. in 1984, which is a tax-exempt, not-for-profit organization. MFA Inc. organized its first Muslim Day Parade in 1985 and since then we have been dutifully holding this parade every year on the last Sunday of September.
  </p>
  <p>
   Our parade always has an Islamic theme and a Muslim Grand Marshal. It represents many Muslim nationalities and their cultures. At the end of the parade, we have a bazaar where vendors are selling foods, clothing, books and etc. from different countries. Also included are programs for the kids.

  <!--This year's Muslim Day Parade event is scheduled for 14 September 2014.-->

 <p>
  As noted above, the event depicted in the four photographs is an annual one, not a weekly one, and the participating group obtains the required parade permits from New York City authorities.
