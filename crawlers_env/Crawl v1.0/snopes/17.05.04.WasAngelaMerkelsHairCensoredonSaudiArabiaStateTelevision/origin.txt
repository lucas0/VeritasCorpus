  German Chancellor Angela Merkel traveled to Saudi Arabia to meet with its top leaders Sunday —but she chose not to wear the traditional headscarf and full-length robe that women and girls who live in the country are forced to wear.

  It was Merkel’s first trip to Saudi Arabia in seven years. Women visiting the country are not legally required to cover their hair or wear a robe, but diplomatic officials have advised them to do so or face possible arrest.
