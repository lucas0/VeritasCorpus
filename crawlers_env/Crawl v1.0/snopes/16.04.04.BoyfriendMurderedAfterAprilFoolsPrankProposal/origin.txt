  Lisa Estevez, 31, is facing first degree murder charges after she shot and killed Ray Jordan, age 25, in the chest. According to authorities, Lisa shot Ray after an April fools prank had gone terribly wrong. Authorities say Ray, who had been dating Lisa for 3 years, apparently got on his knees and proposed to Lisa, only to them open the engagement ring box and reveal the words “April Fools” written inside with no engagement ring to be found. Lisa then immediately reached for Jordan’s firearm, which was laying on the living room couch and shot Jordan once in the chest, killing him instantly.
