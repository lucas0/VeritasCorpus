  Donald Trump has broken all kinds of norms during his presidential campaign, but he just went to a whole new level this morning by tweeting what is supposedly an image of his private-parts. The tweet was quickly deleted but not before being retweeted over 5,000 times.

  The tweet comes in response to comments made by Marco Rubio about the size of Donald Trumpâ€™s hands during the Republican debate last night.
