  The Obama Administration last week announced a change in the complexion of the $20 bill. The familiar portrait of Andrew Jackson, our nationâ€™s 7th president and hero of the Battle of New Orleans, will be cut out of the bill and in its stead will be the likeness of Harriet Tubman, a former slave and smuggler during the abolition era.

 <p>
  The North Carolina State Legislature has just passed a law that will ban the $20 bill from status as legal tender for any public or private debt. Governor Pat McCrory will allegedly sign the bill into law next week.
