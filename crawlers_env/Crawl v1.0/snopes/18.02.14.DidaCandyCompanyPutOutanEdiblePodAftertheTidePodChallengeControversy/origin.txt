  Basically, they are small sized pieces of candy, about the size of a “snack-size” candy bar here, where the bottom part is a plain wafer cup, or “pod” if you will, and inside of it is a gooey-liquid form of whatever the Pods flavor is supposed to be (again, Mars, Twix, etc.). To top it off, the yummy center is coated with a hefty portion of chocolate, no matter what the flavor of the inside.

  My words fail to grasp just how delicious these really are. There are some small drawbacks to Pods though. They suffer from what I like to call the “potato chip” syndrome in that even though it looks like you’re getting a lot when you purchase them, once you open the foil bag and look down inside, you realize that you just paid about $4.00 US for not too many Pods.
