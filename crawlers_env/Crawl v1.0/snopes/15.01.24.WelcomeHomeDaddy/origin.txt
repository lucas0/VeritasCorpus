  A photo seems to be making the rounds on all the “fail” sites. It shows a pregnant woman with “Welcome home daddy” written on her stomach. Images imply that the “father” is returning from a
  <nobr>
   12 month
  </nobr>
  tour in Iraq, and therefore couldn’t be the father. I am curious about the veracity of this, I have been unable to find an actual news article in which this was posted, for all I know the
  <nobr>
   “12 month”
  </nobr>
  thing was photoshopped. A lot of posted comments sort of fall into an argument of whether the guy had leave, or if they don’t allow leave to visit family.
