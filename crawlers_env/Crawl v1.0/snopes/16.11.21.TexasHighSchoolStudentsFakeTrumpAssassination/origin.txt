  I don’t agree with the reprimanding because we fought so hard for free speech, so I can’t knock them on what they did because it makes me a hypocrite of free speech. The CAN say whatever they want and if I don’t agree with it, then that’s my problem. We do not have to agree with everything that everyone says.

  The other factor is that if any students did this with Obama, then the leftist media outlets and liberals everywhere would call the students racist. Even if the kids were black, they would get called racists because Obama is black. Even if the students did this with Obama, and were not racist in anyway in their entire life, they would be labeled as a racist by the inability of the leftists to determine a real racist and their lust to call everyone a bigot.
