  On 7 April 2017, an article appearing to report that White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that he wasn’t worried about starting World War III, since the United States had a strong and confident leader in President Donald Trump, was published by at least two web sites in the
  <em>
   Newslo
  </em>
  network,

  and

  This is not a genuine quote from Sean Spicer.
  <em>
   Newslo
  </em>
  is a “
  <a href="http://politicass.com/about-us/" target="_blank">
   hybrid
  </a>
  ” web site that publishes a mixture of factual and fictional information:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Newslo is the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web. Readers come to us for a unique brand of entertainment and information that is enhanced by features like our fact-button, which allows readers to find what is fact and what is satire.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The web site features a “Show Facts/Hide Facts” button on its hybrid articles that allows readers to identify which part of the article is real and which part is fake. In this case, the article starts with a genuine quote from Spicer, but quickly devolves into misinformation.

  Here’s a look at how the article appears with the “Show Facts” button pressed (left) compared to the “Hide Facts” button (right):
