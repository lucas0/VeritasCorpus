  Fortunately or unfortunately, the image is not legitimate, as the fingers were not originally included on McDonald’s cups; they were drawn in later by a prankster (one, we would assume, familiar with early Internet memes).

  A McDonald’s spokesperson
  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mcdonalds-mcafe-cup-photo_us_584ed13be4b04c8e2bb0b6eb" target="_blank">
   confirmed
  </a>
  that the viral image was an altered version of their original holiday cups:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “Our festive McCafé cups are of mittens not hands,” a rep for McDonald’s told The Huffington Post. “The altered image circulating on social media is the result of someone getting a little cheeky and adding some hand-drawing to a cup.”
