  humorist Art Buchwald — a list of canned responses to criticisms of President Nixon. Some online have questioned its authenticity due to its apparent relevance to today’s political climate. Buchwald introduced that column with this explanation:

 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">

  </p>
 </blockquote>

  Buchwald’s suggestions included:

  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   10 – If you impeach Nixon, you get [Vice President Spiro] Agnew.
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   14 – People would be against Nixon no matter what he did.
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   28 – I’m sick and tired of hearing about Watergate and so is everyone else.
  </p>
