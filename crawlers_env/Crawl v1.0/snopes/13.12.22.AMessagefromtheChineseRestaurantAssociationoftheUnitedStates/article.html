  Nowadays in most U.S. communities, some businesses such as retail stores, grocery stores, drug stores, restaurants (particularly of the fast food variety), and movie theaters are open for at least a portion of Christmas Day.  But back in the day, as older folks are wont to say, this wasn’t the case — the business that wasn’t shuttered tightly for all of Christmas was the rare exception, and consumers looking for a meal, out in search of entertainment, or wanting to pick up a few groceries or other necessities on Christmas Day were often out of luck.

  This circumstance led to the stereotype of Jews patronizing Chinese restaurants on Christmas, a holiday observed by neither the proprietors nor the customers, as described on the

   there are several kosher-certified Chinese restaurants to choose from, so that even the most observant Jew can eat Chinese on Christmas.

  A sign displayed in a widely circulated online image above plays on this stereotype, humorously thanking the “Jewish people” on behalf of the “Chinese Restaurant Association of the United States” for “eat[ing] our food on Christmas”:

   This is supposedly a sign posted.

   This is in reference to the adaptive custom among many American Jews who do not celebrate Christmas to celebrate alternatively by going out to eat Chinese food and see a movie. This photo is posted on many different websites. Sounds like a prank to me imho.
