  Postal officials pitched the idea of creating a “forever stamp” that would be good for sending First-Class mail no matter how much — or how often — the cost of a postage stamp goes up. The announcement came on the same day that the Postal Service said it would seek to raise the price of a First-Class stamp for the second consecutive year.

  The forever stamp, which would cost the same as a First-Class stamp, would provide a hedge against future postal rate increases and end the search for 2- or 3-cent stamps that usually follows a price increase.
