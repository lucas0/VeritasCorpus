  Back in May 2016, Democrats prepared a FAKE Craigslist “Trump employment ad,” using the word “grope,” which as we now know is a common term among these fake Trump accusers.

  How “coincidental” that Democrats were play-acting out a scenario with Trump “groping” and a “kiss on the lips.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Why would they do this when there was never any accusations of his GROPING prior to week three of the presidential election?
