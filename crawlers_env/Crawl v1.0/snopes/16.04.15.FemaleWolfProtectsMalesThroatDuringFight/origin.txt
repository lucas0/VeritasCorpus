  I’ve gotten many messages about this photo. Sad to say that little of anything in that photo’s statement is correct.

  Firstly, there is not a single female in that photo. Shadow (the white male wolf) is giving a threat display to Denali (the taller of the two brown wolves, also male), and Aidan (the crouching male wolf). Aidan is simply submitting and trying to back away, and the photo was taken when he had accidentally bumped into Denali.

  We had one female in the pack at the time this photo was taken, and she looked very different from any of the animals in the photo (Grey and white pelage).
