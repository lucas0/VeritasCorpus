   ORIGIN
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  On 20 October 2016, a video appeared on YouTube with a claim that it was video from the International Space Station showing a “strange,” four-armed craft.
 </p>
 <p>
  The video is extremely grainy, and nothing about it offers any way to ascertain the location, time or date it was spotted, or by whom. The YouTube page that originally up this video is populated with grainy, vague videos that are supposedly space phenomena, like a gun on Mars, or buildings on the moon’s surface.
 </p>
 <p>
  The post, though dubious in its origin, was picked up by conspiracy theory blogs like Disclose.tv:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Commenting on this latest video UFO blogger, Scott C. Waring noted on his UFO Sightings Daily blog that the alien ship has a huge main body with four individual prongs which look like arms.
  </p>
  <p>
   “This UFO was spotted by UFO researcher Streetcap1 of YouTube, ” Waring wrote. “The video shows a long-armed UFO in the distance.”
  </p>
  <p>
   According to the prolific alien hunter, the video also shows that our own sunlight reflects from the body and arms of the UFO, causing it to glisten which proves the authenticity of the video. The reflective properties of the mysterious object confirm its existence, and the object was seen for only a few seconds before NASA’s infamous blue screen appeared.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I feel that the public is trusting NASA less and less when it comes to revealing life on other planets, ” Waring said. “Their true goal seems to be to gather important intelligence, and drip feeds the public enough to satisfy their curiosity.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Other UFO and alien enthusiasts noticed that there was a similarity between this “four armed UFO” and a UFO that has in the past been sighted, multiple times, flying past the sun on NASA SOHO images.

  (SOHO is short for the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory spacecraft, tasked by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration with studying the

  .)
 </p>
 <p>
  While the video shows almost nothing except a blurred image followed by a blue screen — all of which could have easily been created with a toy and rudimentary video-making skills — dubious blogs and conspiracy-minded people have circulated the story along with the claim that this object has been seen before, but NASA is trying hide it:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   SOHO cameras captured similar flybys in 2011, 2012, and 2016… Our Sun appears to be a popular stopover for interstellar crafts, including cruiseships, battleships, and expeditionary fleets, passing through our solar neighborhood.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  If the object has appeared before, and if there are alien spacecraft using the sun as an interstellar freeway overpass, it seems unlikely that anyone would be able to cover it up. It also defies reason that NASA’s own equipment is picking up images of extraterrestrial spacecraft and distributing those images on a platform that the public is easily able to access — but that the agency is denying it.
