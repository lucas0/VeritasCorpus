  Shortly after President Trump

   announced

  on 1 June 2017 that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, politicians such as a Maxine Waters took to Twitter to voice their disagreement. So when a parody account posing as Waters sent out a

  Parody accounts often use a combination of letters to make it appear as if the Twitter handle spells a person’s name.

   @MaxineVVaters
