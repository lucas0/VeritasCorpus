  Castoreum (or castor, not to be confused with the oil of a castor bean) is a yellowish-brown, unctuous substance with a strong, penetrating odor which beavers secrete from castor sacs located in skin cavities between the pelvis and the base of the tail and spray when scent-marking their territory.  (The location of the beaver’s castor sacs means that castoreum also often includes a mixture of anal gland secretions and urine as well.) Due to the beaver’s typical diet of leaves and bark, castoreum doesn’t “stink” as other similar animal secretions do, but rather has a musky, vanilla scent described at the perfume site

  as a “sharp spreading tar-like note that reminds one of the odor of birch tar or Russian leather” that when diluted in alcohol picks up “more pleasant, musky and fruity nuances.”

  has long been employed in the perfume-making industry, and processed forms of castoreum have also been used as food additives, in the latter case primarily as enhancers of vanilla, strawberry and raspberry flavorings found in products such as iced tea, ice cream, gelatin, candy, fruit-flavored drinks, and yogurt.

  However, the publicity afforded castoreum in recent years via alarmist food activists and “Did you know?” social media posts is vastly overblown:

   Another reason we may want to forgo artificial ‘foods’ … Have you ever wondered where artificial raspberry, vanilla or strawberry flavor comes from? These are the dried perineal glands of the beaver. They contain

   food additive usually listed as ‘natural flavoring’ in the ingredient list. Castoreum is the exudate from the castor sacs of the mature North American Beaver, it is a yellowish secretion in combination with the beaver’s urine, used during scent marking of territory. In the USA, castoreum as a food additive is considered by the FDA to be generally recognized as safe, often referenced simply as a “natural flavoring” in products’ lists of ingredients.

  The use of castoreum in common food products today is exceedingly rare, in large part because collecting the substance is difficult (and therefore expensive):

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Getting a beaver to produce castoreum for purposes of food processing is tough. Foodies bent on acquiring some of the sticky stuff have to anesthetize the animal and then “milk” its nether regions.
  </p>
  <p>
   “You can milk the anal glands so you can extract the fluid,” [Joanne] Crawford [a wildlife ecologist at Southern Illinois University] said. “You can squirt [castoreum] out. It’s pretty gross.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Due to such unpleasantness for both parties, castoreum consumption is rather small.
