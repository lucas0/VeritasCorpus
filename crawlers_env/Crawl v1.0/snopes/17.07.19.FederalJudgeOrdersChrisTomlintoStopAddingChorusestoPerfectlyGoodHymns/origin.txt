 <p>
  ATLANTA, GA—A federal judge passed down a ruling Tuesday morning ordering popular worship and CCM artist Chris Tomlin to immediately cease and desist adding catchy choruses to perfectly good hymns, sources confirmed moments ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  The order bars Tomlin from modifying, altering, deleting, or adding any lyrics of songs originally published in church hymnals before 1959.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tomlin burst out weeping as the verdict was read.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What am I supposed to do now? This is my entire livelihood!” he cried out. “I just came up with a really snappy chorus for the Doxology too. That would have made millions!”
