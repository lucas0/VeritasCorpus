  The fiery head-on collision that killed two people on Interstate 40 near downtown Knoxville marks the fifth fatal crash involving a wrong-way driver along the same 4-mile stretch since March 2013, police records show.

 <p>
  The latest was reported shortly after 1 a.m. when 21-year-old Maryville College graduate Anthony Swartz drove west into the eastbound lanes and struck an oncoming tractor-trailer at mile marker 387 just west of the Interstate 275 interchange, according to the Knoxville Police Department.

  The crash killed Swartz and truck driver Carroll Trent, 67, of Evington, Va. The impact ignited more than 800 pounds of benzoquinone, a flammable hazardous material Trent was hauling from Nashville to Virginia, destroying the truck and its tandem trailers.
