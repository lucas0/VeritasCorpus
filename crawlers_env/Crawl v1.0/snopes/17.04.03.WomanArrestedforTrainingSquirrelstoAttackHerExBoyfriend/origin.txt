  45-year old Janice Smith was arrested this morning by officers of the Detroit Police Department, for allegedly capturing numerous squirrels and training them to attack her former lover.

  The victim, 51-year old James Robinson, was presumably attacked by the rodents on more than a dozen occasions over the last month.
