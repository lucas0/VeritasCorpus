  Ball-Point Pens for the Astronauts
 </p>
 <p>
  When NASA started sending astronauts into space, they quickly
  <br>
   Discovered that ball-point pens would not work in zero
   <br/>
   Gravity. To combat this problem, NASA scientists spent a
   <br/>
   Decade and $12 billion developing a pen that writes in zero
   <br/>
   Gravity, upside-down, on almost any surface including glass
   <br/>
   And at temperatures ranging from below freezing to over 300 C.

 <p>
  The Russians used a pencil.

  There is a charming anecdote that roams from e-mail box to e-mail box around the world about how, at the height of the space race, the Americans and Soviets approached the same problem: how an astronaut (or cosmonaut) could use a pen to write in zero gravity.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the story goes, the Americans spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on an ambitious, gravity-immune ballpoint pen; they successfully developed such a pen; and this pen went on to become a massive commercial success in the private sector. The Soviets — with the simple elegance their scientists are so rightly famed for — opted instead to use a pencil.
