 <p>
  Dialog from a Tonight Show … Johnny Carson … His guest was Lee Marvin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Johnny said … “Lee, I’ll bet a lot of people are unaware that you were a Marine in the initial landing at Iwo
  <nobr>
   Jima …
  </nobr>
  and that during the course of that action you earned the Navy Cross and were severely wounded.”
 </p>
 <p>
  And you know how Lee
  <nobr>
   was …
  </nobr>
  “Yeah,
  <nobr>
   yeah …
  </nobr>
  I got shot square in the ass and they gave me the Cross for securing a hot spot about halfway up Suribachi. Bad thing about getting shot up on a mountain is guys gettin’ shot hauling you down. But Johnny at Iwo I served under the bravest man I ever
  <nobr>
   knew …
  </nobr>
  We both got the Cross the same day but what he did for his Cross made mine look cheap in comparison. The dumb bastard actually stood up on Red Beach and directed his troops to move forward and get the hell off the beach. That Sgt. and I have been life long
  <nobr>
   friends …
  </nobr>
  When they brought me off Suribachi we passed the Sgt. and he lit a smoke and passed it to me lying on my belly on the
  <nobr>
   litter …
  </nobr>
  “Where’d they get you Lee?”…. “Well
  <nobr>
   Bob …
  </nobr>
  if you make it home before me, tell Mom to sell the outhouse.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Johnny, I’m not lying …
  <nobr>
   Sgt. Keeshan
  </nobr>
  was the bravest man I ever
  <nobr>
   Knew — Bob
  </nobr>
  <nobr>
   Keeshan …
  </nobr>
  You and the world know him as Captain Kangaroo.”

  Many people have always been a bit offended that Lee Marvin is buried in a grove of 3 and
  <nobr>
   4 star
  </nobr>
  generals at Arlington. His marker gives his name, rank (PVT) and service (USMC). Nothing else.
 </p>
 <p>
  I thought to myself, damn here’s a guy who was only a famous movie star who served his time, why the heck does he rate burial with these guys? Well, following is the amazing answer:
 </p>
 <p>
  I always liked Lee Marvin, but did not know the extent of his Corps experiences. Including award of the Navy Cross. There is only one higher award…the Medal Of Honor.
