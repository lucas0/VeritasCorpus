  You Do Not Represent Us: An Open Letter to Donald Trump
 </p>
 <p>
  At the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, students are taught to represent the highest levels of respect and integrity. We are taught to embrace humility and diversity. We can understand why, in seeking Americaâ€™s highest office, you have used your degree from Wharton to promote and lend legitimacy to your candidacy.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a candidate for President, and now as the presumptive GOP nominee, you have been afforded a transformative opportunity to be a leader on national and international stages and to make the Wharton community even prouder of our school and values.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, we have been deeply disappointed in your candidacy.
