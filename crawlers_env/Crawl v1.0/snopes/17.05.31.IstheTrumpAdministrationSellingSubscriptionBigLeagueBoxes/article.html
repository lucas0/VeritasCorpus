  On 29 May 2017, reporters tweeted screenshots of e-mails they received from President Trump’s mailing list, inviting recipients to take advantage of a subscription called the “Big League Box”:

  Not everyone was convinced the boxes were legitimate:

   Complicating matters was the fact that not all subscribers to President Trump’s e-mail updates received the purported e-mail, and news outlets reporting on the story largely referenced

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   President Donald Trump will reportedly take a page from the subscription box business model with his own monthly box full of stuff people probably don’t want.
  </p>
  <p>
   As CNN reporter Betsy Klein tweeted Monday, the Trump Make America Great Again Committee will offer “Big League Boxes,” packed with “exclusive and vintage” (read: old) Trump merchandise and delivered monthly to recurring donors’ doors.

 <p>
  Missing from all the articles was a link to the purported “Big League Boxes” subscription signup page, and Trump’s web site’s “

  It is true that the web site offers “OFFICIAL Donald J. Trump merchandise” in monthly “Big League Boxes” in exchange for a “recurring contribution of just $49 or more.” (Some versions of the e-mail reportedly asked for “$69 or more.”) As of 31 May 2017, no one had reported purchasing or receiving the boxes to describe its contents, but the link and advertisement (archived above) are real.
