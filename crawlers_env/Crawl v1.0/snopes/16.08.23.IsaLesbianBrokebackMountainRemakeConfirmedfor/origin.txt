  12 years after the celebrated gay love story took the world by storm, a lesbian remake plans to do it all again.

  At a press conference in Los Angeles this morning, production company River Road Entertainment, the makers of Jake Gyllenhaal and the late Heath Ledgers’ huge cult classic “Brokeback Mountain”, announced that a remake of the film will hit the screens in 2017. The film will follow two lesbian lovers in rural USA and will retain most of the themes of the original film, aside from the obvious gender switch. Mega-stars Margot Robbie and Emma Watson have been cast to play the two lesbians struggling to compromise their secret lesbian relationship with their intolerant surroundings.
