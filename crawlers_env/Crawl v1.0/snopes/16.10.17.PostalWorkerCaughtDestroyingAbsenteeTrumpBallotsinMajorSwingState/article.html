  On 16 October 2016, Twitter user “@randygdub” claimed that he worked for the United States Postal Service (USPS) in Columbus, Ohio, and enjoyed “ripping up” absentee ballots cast for Donald Trump:

  The tweet went viral and provoked significant outrage, prompting several web sites to inaccurately report that a USPS employee was “caught” ripping up Trump ballots.  The person who tweeted this was not a confirmed postal worker, much less caught in the act. Many people in the angry camp apparently did not view the rest of @randygdub’s tweets, which are inconsistent and apparently published solely to cause controversy:

  The user posted no proof of employment with USPS or any organization, nor was his story particularly plausible:

   That person is part of “Weird Twitter.” They’re lying and don’t actually work at a post office. — Ian Miles Cheong (@stillgray)

  We contacted the Franklin County Board of Elections and the Ohio Secretary of State’s Elections division and asked about the mailing format of Ohio’s absentee
  <a href="https://www.vote.org/state/ohio/" target="_blank">
   ballots
  </a>
  . They told us that Ohio’s absentee ballots are enclosed in not one but two secrecy envelopes, making it impossible for postal workers to identify “Trump votes” without opening envelopes:

  was deluged with complaints. A representative
  <a href="https://twitter.com/USPSHelp/status/788105012236816384" target="_blank">
   confirmed
  </a>
  that the Postal Service investigated and determined that “Raandy” was most likely not an employee:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Postal Service has completed an initial investigation of the mentioned tweets and does not believe these tweets were made by a postal employee. However, the Postal Service will continue to monitor this situation and if it is determined that the individual making the tweets is a postal employee and there is substantiated evidence of mail being tampered with or destroyed , then the Postal Service will take appropriate corrective action to address the situation. Thank you ^cmm

  Although many web sites framed the claim to suggest that a USPS employee had been caught ripping up ballot envelopes which contained Trump votes, the claim appeared on social media without any proof to substantiate it.
