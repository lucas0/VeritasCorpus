  On 3 October 2016, Kim Kardashian-West was

   robbed
  </a>
  at gunpoint in Paris. While French police began their search for the jewelry thieves, web sites such as
  <em>
   Your News Wire
  </em>
  published articles promoting the baseless claim that the star’s husband Kanye West was behind the heist:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Kanye West is wanted for questioning by police as a suspect in the Paris robbery case after more evidence has emerged suggesting the jewelry theft was an “inside job.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Police believe somebody close to Kim Kardashian helped tip off the thieves and Kanye West, though performing at Meadows Festival in New York at the time, has been summoned to the French capital for questioning.
  </p>
  <p>
   A police source, describing the case as “
   <i>
    one of the strangest
   </i>
   ” they have worked on, said Kanye has “
   <i>
    been evasive
   </i>
   ” and has yet to agree to dates for his hearing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The bad news for Kanye is that the United States does have an extradition treaty with France, although there has been a history of reluctance on both sides to honor it.

  , is based almost entirely on a comment made by former bodyguard, Steve Stanulis, who said that the robbery was likely an “inside job”:

   While Stanulis did say that the robbery was likely an inside job, he did not say that he suspected Kanye West. In fact, Stanulis pointed at several other prospects, including the concierge, a doorman, or an airport worker.

  It should also be noted that while
  <em>
   Your News Wire
  </em>
  provided links to the various quotes it offered in their report, they offered no supporting information for the claim that Kanye West was wanted as a suspect by police. This alleged aspect of the case was also ignored by credible outlets such as the
  <em>

    Atlantic

  and the

    Associated Press

  </em>
  The only other “report” we could find claiming that West was wanted in connection with the robbery of his wife, came from the fake news outlet
  <em>
   World News Daily Report.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  According to

    People
   </a>
  </em>
  magazine, both Kim and Kanye were back in New York the day after the theft in Paris.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the investigation into this armed robbery is ongoing, Kanye West has not been named a suspect as of this writing.
