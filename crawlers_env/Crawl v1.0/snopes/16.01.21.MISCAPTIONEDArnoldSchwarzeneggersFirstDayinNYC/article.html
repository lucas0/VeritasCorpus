  On 20 January 2016, the Twitter account @OldPicsArchive shared an old photograph of Arnold Schwarzenegger along with the claim that it showed the body-builder/actor “seeing NYC for the first time.”

  online with similar captions for several years. While this image does indeed show Arnold Schwarzenegger in New York City, this isn’t a candid photograph of Schwarzenegger-as-tourist, as @OldPicsArchive suggests.

  <em>
   Hercules in New York
  </em>
  was filmed shortly after Arnold Schwarzenegger arrived in the United States in 1968, this image does not capture Arnold Schwarzenegger’s genuine reaction upon seeing New York City for the first time.
