   Take a look at the guy in the picture.
  </br>
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s Steve Miller, senior advisor to Donald Trump. He’s also an avowed racist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Don’t take my word for it—that’s what his friends and family say. He hasn’t been quiet about it at all: he has openly disparaged blacks, Latinos, and Asians throughout his school career, from high school to Duke University, where he palled around with white supremacist leader Richard Spencer.
 </p>
 <p>
  You might think that’s an odd natural gesture to make. And it is. What Steve is doing is completely intentional:
 </p>
 <p>
  The right hand, on top, is showing just three fingers: “W”.
  <br/>
  His left hand curls to make the “P” formation.
  <br/>
  WP. White Power. White nationalists know exactly what that sign means.
  <br/>
  According to the Anti-Defamation League, this is a common white supremacist hand sign “particularly” used in California. (Stephen Miller is from Santa Monica.)
