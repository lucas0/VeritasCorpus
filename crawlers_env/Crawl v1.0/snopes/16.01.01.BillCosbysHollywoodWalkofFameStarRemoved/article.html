  came more than a year after allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct against the comedian began attracting wide attention. In October 2014, stand-up comedian Hannibal Buress performed a bit during which he referenced multiple accusations against Cosby over the years. While the commentary wasn’t new (Buress had made the joke several times before), an audience member uploaded

  of it to YouTube, which catalyzed new interest in the claims.
 </p>
 <p>
  More than a year after Buress’ stand-up performance went viral, Cosby was arraigned at a district court in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania. The day after his court appearance, the “Walk of Fame” photograph began circulating on social media alongside claims that Cosby’s star was either in the process of being removed, or was slated for removal.

 <p>
  The claims were false on several levels. For one, the image was inaccurately described. While it involved Cosby’s scandals, it was

   In response to the vandalism, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce released the following statement: “The Hollywood Walk of Fame is an institution celebrating the positive contributions of the inductees. When people are unhappy with one of our honorees, we would hope that they would project their anger in more positive ways then to vandalize a California State landmark.
   <strong>
    The star is being cleaned up at this time

  titled “Bill Cosby, Donald Trump and 7 More Scandalous Stars Immortalized on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame” contains a statement from the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce about the removal of controversial stars from the Walk:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Once a star has been added to the Walk, it is considered a part of the historic fabric of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Because of this, we have never removed a star from the Walk.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  As such, the photograph did not depict the removal of Bill Cosby’s Walk of Fame star.  Additionally, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce confirmed that no star has ever been removed under similar circumstances.
