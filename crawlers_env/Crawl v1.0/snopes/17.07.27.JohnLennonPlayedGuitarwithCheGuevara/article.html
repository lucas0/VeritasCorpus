  “The Walrus and the Elephants: John Lennon’s Years of Revolution,” which detailed Lennon’s post-Beatles years and started with a dedication to Wayne “Tex” Gabriel and Lennon:

During the few years that Guevara and Lennon could have met, the revolutionary was busy leading guerrilla troops in the Congo and Bolivia. Furthermore, Lennon’s
