  On 22 September 2017, in the aftermath of several highly publicized (and occasionally violent) anti-fascist counterprotests at white supremacist rallies in 2017, the satirical web site
  <a href="http://archive.is/1QRU7" target="_blank">
   Last Line of Defense
  </a>
  falsely reported that the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton had secretly donated a total of $7.1 million to the international anti-fascist movement known as “antifa”.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to a “bombshell” report from Breitbart.com, the Clinton Foundation made some interesting “donations” to Antifa International in the amount of $75,983, multiple separate donations to Unite Against Fascism of more than $25,000 each, as well as donations to other antifa groups. In total, she handed out more than $7.1 million to fund groups that brutally attack conservatives.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is no such report, and there were no such donations.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can check the Clinton Foundation’s spending over recent years in various IRS Form 990s on the organization’s

  . None of these documents show any donations to any anti-fascist groups. Funding and donations to and from the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative have been the subject of many
