  In mid-November 2016, a number of web sites published a video of people climbing on a Christmas tree in a Western-style shopping mall, along with
  <a href="http://archive.is/MX1lG/image" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   claims
  </a>
  that it depicted Muslims attacking the familiar holiday symbol because it offended them:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Ahh, the religion of peace and tolerance. Whenever Muslims move to Western nations they try to change everything about the culture to conform to sharia law. When they’re not doing that, they’re tearing down Christmas trees, because, Jesus, birth of the Son of God and all that. To them, Jesus is only a prophet, to Christians, He is God’s only son born of a woman.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can see in the video several Muslim men climbing a Christmas tree in a Mall. They are trying to tear it apart. They don’t do a very good job which leads one to believe it must be made of metal or something.

  Most versions didn’t specifically say that the video was filmed in the United States (they were tellingly vague about the who, what, when, where, and why aspects of the clip), but some of them referenced “Western nations” and the purported failure of Muslims to assimilate in Western countries.
 </p>
 <p>
  Advancing the suggestion that the video had been filmed in America was a nearly universally included ancillary (and
  <a href="http://archive.is/2ST7l/image" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   misleading
  </a>
  ) claim that Muslims had
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/education/muslimchristmas.asp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   demanded
  </a>
  the cancellation of Christmas holidays in Maryland public schools (back in 2014):
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Religion of peace huh? The video below seems to point to the contrary as Muslims are seen tearing down a mall Christmas tree because it is a Christian holiday and in their minds, Jesus was only a prophet.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   Now, this isn’t the only time Muslims have attacked Christmas. Islamists in Maryland complained that they didn’t have a holiday for their “holy days” like Christians do, and a school board removed Yom Kippur, Easter, and Christmas from their school calendar.

  Despite an utter lack of contextual information, the clip spread like wildfire on Facebook and Twitter. Previous

  Commenters on a now-deleted
  <a href="https://archive.is/eVV4d" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   version
  </a>
  of the video published in November 2016 noted that the clip was at least a year old, and added that it did not show anyone attempting to “attack” the tree. Rather, the commenter noted that the depicted trees were “climbable” and observed that the “angry Muslims” were actually revelers who wore Christmas hats, appeared to be in good spirits, and were retrieving gifts placed at the top of the tree for kids to find:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   This appears to be last Christmas at the Mall of Arabia in Cairo, Egypt. And it does not necessarily seem to be an attack according to a number of comments made by people on the video both here and on another site. One says: “Supposedly they make them climbable and there are little gift boxes at the top. We can see some people proudly showing little packages they snatch from the top of the tree. At one point a string of Christmas lights falls off the left side of the tree and someone tries to put it back on. Some people in the crowd are wearing red Christmas hats. There are even women without Muslim headscarves wearing Christmas hats in the crowd who do not look frightened at all. This video has been circulating for a while and at different times people falsely claimed that this is in the U.S. and in Sweden.” I even just read an article claiming this was in Iraq, but I have been to most of the malls in northern Iraq and I can tell you this is not in Iraq. I did find numerous pictures of the Mall of Arabia in Cairo that match up with this though. The above explanation seems plausible since throughout the video you can see the guys detaching some things from the tree and giving them to other people.

 <p>
  Versions from November 2016 claimed  that “several Muslim men” were attempting to “tear down” the tree, but still shots from the video show women and children climbing it. Furthermore, one man near the top of the tree appears to hold a “gift” plucked from the tree’s apex:
