 <p>
  [T]he Muslim terrorist duo Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik received a traditional Islamic burial along with FBI protection.

 <p>
  Following the attack, the Obama administration purportedly scrambled to locate a burial site willing to accept the bodies. They feared that allowing them to be cremated, a funeral practice that is strictly forbidden under Islamic law, would cause unrest among the Muslim community.
