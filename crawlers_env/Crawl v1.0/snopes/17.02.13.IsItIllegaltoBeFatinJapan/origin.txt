 <p>
  Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of
  <nobr>
   conditions — increased
  </nobr>
  blood pressure, a high blood sugar level, excess body fat around the waist and abnormal cholesterol
  <nobr>
   levels — that
  </nobr>
  occur together, increasing your risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having just one of these conditions doesn’t mean you have metabolic syndrome. However, any of these conditions increase your risk of serious disease. If more than one of these conditions occur in combination, your risk is even greater.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you have metabolic syndrome or any of the components of metabolic syndrome, aggressive lifestyle changes can delay or even prevent the development of serious health problems.
