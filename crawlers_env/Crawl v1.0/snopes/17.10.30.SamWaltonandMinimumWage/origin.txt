  “We must have cheap help or we cannot sell cheap goods,” wrote Frank. W. Woolworth to his store managers in 1892, when his chain of five-and-dimes had but a handful of outlets. “When a clerk gets so good she can get better wages elsewhere, let her go … It may look hard to some of you for us to pay such small wages but … one thing is certain: we cannot afford to pay good wages and sell goods as we do now, and our clerks ought to know it.” Sam Walton understood this as well. As he wrote in his memoir, “No matter how you slice it in the retail  business, payroll is one of the most crucial things you have to fight to maintain your profit margin. That was true then, and it is still true today.” By his own admission, Walton was a “chintzy” employer in the early years. Since all retail clerks were exempt from the federal minimum wage law in the 1950s, Walton could pay as little as fifty cents an hour, which was a rock-bottom wage even for small-town Arkansas. When in 1955 Charlie Baum, the manager of Walton’s Fayetteville Ben Franklin, gave his “girls” a twenty-five-cent-an-hour raise, Sam was immediately on the phone: “Charlie, we don’t give raises of a quarter an hour. We give them a nickel an hour.”
