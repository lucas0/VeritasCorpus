 <p>
  Former president Barack Obama has been shooting his mouth off about everything lately.
 </p>
 <p>
  He doesn’t like President Trump’s plan to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, hates his new budget proposal and really can’t stand the Republican plan to overhaul Obamacare. On each topic, Obama has been highly vocal, seeking out media coverage.
 </p>
 <p>
  But when a Republican congressman was shot and badly wounded last week during a practice for a bipartisan congressional baseball game — silence. Not a peep.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet Obama did reappear to praise former crack cocaine dealer and one-time thug Jay-Z in a video for his induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.
