  A former White House intern is coming under fire after flashing a known ‘white power’ sign during a photo-op with President Donald Trump.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jack Breuer, who graduated from Emory University in Atlanta this year, is clearly bucking orders — personally given by the president — to give a thumbs-up in the picture that was taken in the White House in November.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the other hundred or so interns smile and follow Trump’s command, Breuer, a dentist’s son who grew up in Chicago’s western suburbs, stands stony-faced giving the ‘OK’ sign that has been linked with far-right groups.
