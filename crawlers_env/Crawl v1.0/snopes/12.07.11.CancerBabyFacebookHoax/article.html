  This appeal to help a child with cancer is merely yet another reiteration of a long-running class of
  <a href="cancer.asp">
   hoax
  </a>
  (often built around
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2016/01/15/death-hoaxes-like-farming/" target="lf">
   like farming
  </a>
  ), one which lures the gullible into spreading such messages by promising that some entity (such as Facebook) will donate money towards the medical treatment of a child with cancer (or some other disease) every time the message is forwarded, posted, liked, or shared. Multiple charities and companies have been unfairly dragged into such hoaxes over the years by being named in messages like these, causing them to have to spend considerable time and effort disclaiming them.

  The child whose photograph was appropriated for this hoax is not displaying visible symptoms of cancer.

   on multiple other online sites as a boy experiencing a

The child pictured is a Vietnamese orphan who was adopted by a California family several years ago, and almost certainly his photo (which was taken in 2005 at the orphanage in Vietnam where he lived prior to his adoption) was selected at random by the hoaxsters for their purposes, as that same image has been present on the Internet since at least 
<NOBR>mid-2007</NOBR> (see, for example, <A HREF="http://blog.tjomlid.com/?p=274" TARGET=a target="_blank">here</A> and <A HREF="http://www.alarab.net/Article/00034556" TARGET=b target="_blank">here</A>).  And although many people who view this child's picture instinctively think the reddish mass on the side of his face must be a cancerous tumor, it was in fact the product of <A HREF="http://drugster.info/ail/pathography/3264/" TARGET=hem target="_blank">hemangioma</A>, an abnormal buildup of blood vessels in the skin which can produce massive, raised tumors with blood vessels on the face and neck, which has since been removed.

  Others versions of this hoax positing that Facebook will donate money every time such an item is liked or shared have circulated using a variety of different (unrelated) pictures:
