  A rumor holding that Ohio’s Cedar Point amusement park (billed as “The Roller Coaster Capital of the World”) would not be reopening for the upcoming tourist season on 6 May 2017, as scheduled, has been widely circulated on Facebook.

  Although this image resembles a genuine news item link, Facebook users who clicked on it were not redirected to a news article about Cedar Point. Rather, they were greeted with an image informing them that they had been “owned” in a Facebook prank:
