  Hi everyone my leg was grotesquely broken when cops attacked our peaceful protest in Rhode Island. The mainstream media (especially the Associated Press) has ignored these horrendous photographs that show the horrific injuries I suffered when the cops attacked. Please feel free to make these telling photos available to all your friends who value freedom and liberty
