  Albeit riddled with misspellings and grammatical errors — not to mention the nonsensical claim that “the Bill for the Executive Order Enacting Martial Law has been put into effect” — the document instantly went viral and was shared on conspiracy web sites such as

The Posse Comitatus Act forbids military involvement in domestic law enforcement without congressional approval.
