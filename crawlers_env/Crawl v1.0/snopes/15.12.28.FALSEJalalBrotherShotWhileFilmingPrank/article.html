  an article claiming that one of three brothers from Melbourne, Australia, known for making YouTube

  , had been shot while filming a prank:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   One of the brothers, Arman Jalal, was shot in the stomach after ‘pranking’ the wrong man.  The incident occurred late Tuesday night in a parking garage in East Melbourne.  The brother is said to be in critical but stable condition at St Vincents &amp; Mercy Private Hospital.
  </p>
  <p>
   The man they pranked, Scotty Southam, 31, is currently being questioned by Victoria Police but there are reports that he will not be charged.

  The above-quoted article was published shortly after the Jalals published a video where a man dressed in “traditional” Arab dress throws “fake bombs” at civilians:
