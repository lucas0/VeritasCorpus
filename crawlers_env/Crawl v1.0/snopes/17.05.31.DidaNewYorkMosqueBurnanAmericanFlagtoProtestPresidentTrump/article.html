  On 30 May 2017, the web site
  <em>
   The New York Evening
  </em>
  <a href="https://archive.is/qbfYH" target="_blank">
   published
  </a>
  a fake news story claiming that a group of Muslims from a New York mosque burned an American flag in protest of President Trump:

   The Masjid Abu Bakr mosque in Flushing, New York, burned an American flag on Saturday in protest of the Trump presidency.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Down with Trump!” and “Not my president”, they chanted as the flag burned.
  </p>
  <p>
   Many are disgusted by the act and have called for the mosque to face legal punishment, or at the very least lose their tax exempt status.

  This photograph is real. However, it has little to do with President Trump and was not taken at a New York mosque.  It is a photograph originally taken by
  <em>
   Associated Press
  </em>
  photographer A.M. Ahad on 21 September 2012, and it shows a group of people in Bangladesh burning an American flag in protest of the anti-Islam film “Innocence of Muslims”:

  The uncropped image, which is available

  , shows that the flag was being burned on top of a coffin with the words “Coffin of Obama,” not “Coffin of Trump,” written on its side. The text of this article also has a dubious origin. Despite that, it has been copied by a

  Again, this image has nothing to do with President Trump or a New York mosque. This image was taken by

  A statement at the bottom of UndergroundNewsReport.com identifies the web site as a “news and political satire” publication:

 <blockquote>
