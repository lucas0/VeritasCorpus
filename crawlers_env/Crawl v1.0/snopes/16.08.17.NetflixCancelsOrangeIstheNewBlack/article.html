  In July 2016, the web site
  <em>
   TMZ Uncut
  </em>
  published an article reporting that Netflix had cancelled the upcoming fifth season of the popular prison drama
  <em>
   Orange Is the New Black
  </em>
  after company employees “stopped coming to work”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Netflix Cancels Orange Is The New Black Season 5 After Employees Stop Coming To Work?
  </p>
  <p>
   “Time is very important and something we can’t get back once its gone, we feel that people are missing spending time with their families because if the show” – M.Scott
  </p>
  <p>
   This decision was made after 78 of netflix 2,000 employees failed to come in to work after a Orange is the new black watch party.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  This report was just a fabrication, however. While it’s unclear exactly who produces the content of
  <em>
   TMZ Uncut
  </em>
  (not to be confused with the real TMZ celebrity gossip and news site), they share a Facebook page with
  <em>
   Celebritricity
  </em>
  , a well-known purveyor of fake news that claims “people don’t want to be informed, they want to be entertained.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Netflix has not made any announcements suggesting
  <em>
   Orange Is the New Black
  </em>
  is due for imminent cancellation. In fact, the show has already been

   renewed

  through season 7.
