  , and, of course, rumors and scams in its wake.
 </p>
 <p>
  One such rumor involved high-paying Federal Emergency Management Agency jobs (“FEMA Field Inspectors”) purportedly created by the storm. Readers forwarded various versions of the rumor they spotted on social media, most mentioning a “Mr. Adrian Davis” recruiting a thousand workers for positions paying between $2,000 and $5,000 per week:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   FEMA is looking to hire help. $2000 per week plus expenses. 90 days or longer they need over 1000 people. Cannot have any felonies. 888 776 1296. Mr. Adrian Davis.
   <br>
    True of False?
    <br/>
    I have not been able to verify this-the phone number goes from a fast busy to a regular busy.
    <br/>
    Thank you
   </br>
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   There is a post going around Facebook seeking FEMA Field Inspectors. $4-5 K per week. No experience necessary. The ad contains an error: “Will be reimburse travel”
   <br/>
   The phone number to call is 214-[redacted].
   <br/>
   All sounds too good to be true and I don’t see anything similar on the FEMA website or Facebook page.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   Can you please check out a rumor via Facebook that FEMA is paying people up to 5,000 dollars per week to work in Houston as field inspectors. They have to call 214.[redacted] to register.
   <br/>
   Why wouldn’t the FEMA hire people directly? Sounds like a HUGE scam to me!!
  </p>

  The rumor spread quickly, thanks to its plausible premise of FEMA being understaffed in August 2017, the high (but not impossibly so) pay described, and the ease with which one could plausibly qualify. Although some iterations listed an area code of (888) and a contact name of “Adrian Davis,” others provided a 214 (Dallas-area) number which appears to have no affiliation with FEMA. A poster provided an application

  <!--Some users appeared to already be planning their FEMA-related absence, while other posters <a href="https://www.facebook.com/madi.torres/posts/10154954848361172" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ImHenryJames/posts/10159291631760343" target="_blank" rel="noopener">friends</a> to be skeptical about FEMA Field Inspector job listings, pointing out several reasons the rumors didn't seem to be on the level:


<blockquote>My FEMA family *** please copy &amp; share ***
Too much FAKE announcements again****

I have had calls and emails asking about advertisements for FEMA jobs. So, I would like to take some time this morning and give out some advice.

1st of all, it is still too early for FEMA to know what all they will need laborers for. It will take sometime for this to take place.

2nd, I have seen ads popping up already advertising FEMA jobs. Stay away from these. The fine print discloses that you pay a fee for this service. I will discuss this a little further into this.

3rd, FEMA is a government agency. They do not advertise through companies and there is no fee for filing out an application for these jobs.

A. All government jobs are listed at usajobs.gov. This includes FEMA jobs. Those listings explains the job requirements and pay.
B. All applications for government jobs (including FEMA) must be filled out online.
C. If, FEMA uses any other agency to give notice of these jobs it is through the different states Employment Service. These services provide you the means of filling out these applications on line.

4th. Veterans preferences applies to all jobs (even if temporary) for jobs with FEMA.

5t. STAY AWAY FROM ANY ADVERTISEMENTS FOR FEMA JOBS. IF, YOU ARE INTERESTED IN WORKING THE DISASTER AREAS, AND THINGS RELATED TO FEMA JOBS, GO TO usajobs.gov for these listings. ****All other advertisements are after your money!!!

EVENTUALLY, FEMA will subcontract jobs to companies throughout the United States, but they will list these companies. If, someone hires on to one of the subcontractors, they become an employee of that subcontractor and not FEMA.



<hr />

Fema jobs will not be posted on FB. You can go yup FEMA.gov under careers. There may be contractors trying to hire people to get a government contract for their come up (i.e. government debris removal, or housing inspectors) but FEMA it's not at that stage yet. I would say do your due diligence. I definitely would not advise anyone to give their information over the phone.</blockquote>

  According to FEMA, these jobs are available under a pre-existing contract “to assist with surge capacity,” and the 214 number circulating is legitimate, as is the 31 August 2017 deadline. However, FEMA says the 888 number is not legitimate and the “$2,000 a week for 90 days” claim is inaccurate.

  We contacted the agency for further confirmation, but we have not yet received a response.
