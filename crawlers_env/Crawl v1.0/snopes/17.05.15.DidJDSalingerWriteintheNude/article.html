  A photograph of a naked man sitting a suitcase and using typewriter received attention on social media on 15 May 2017 after the
  <a href="https://archive.is/Y91Ef" target="_blank">
   Twitter
  </a>
  account @oldpicsarchive posted it along with the claim that the writer was J.D. Salinger, author of
  <em>
   The Catcher in the Rye
  </em>
  :

  Because you cannot see his face, the claim seems plausible. The man in the
  <a href="https://archive.is/1bOJr" target="_blank">

  , however, is not J.D. Salinger, but
  <a href="http://efanzines.com/EK/eI17/" target="_blank">
   Jayson Loam
  </a>
  (also known as Stan Sohler), a writer for
  <em>
   American Sunbathing Magazine.
  </em>
  According to the photograph’s caption,  which was written by science fiction fan and longtime publisher

   Earl Kemp

  (a friend of Loam’s) in

  , Loam was filing copy from a California nudist camp:

  Even so, the photograph has been

   linked
  </a>
  to Salinger since at least 2013, and appears to serve as the sole piece of evidence for the claim that the
  <em>
   Catcher In the Rye
  </em>
  author was known for writing in the nude. NinjaEssays.com published an infographic showing the “Unusual Work Habits of Great Writers” in 2014, which

  However, NinjaEssay’s source for this claim was a single post on
  <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-unusual-work-habits-of-famous-writers" target="_blank">
   Quora
  </a>
  that simply included this photograph and the author’s name.
 </p>
 <p>
  The photograph also bears only a passing resemblance to J.D. Salinger, who was notorious for hating to be photographed. Photographer Antony di Gesu recalled a 1952 photography session with Salinger (from which many of the most iconic

  of him came) in an excerpt from an unpublished
  <a href="http://www.sandiegohistory.org/collection/photographs/digesu2/" target="_blank">
   memoir
  </a>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   On the 20th of November, 1952, J.D. Salinger (author of Catcher in the Rye) came to the studio and said he wanted a portrait of himself for his mother and his fiancee. Since I didn’t [know] as much then as I do now, I set up the camera and light and sat him right down. His expression was so rigid and self-conscious [that] I was at my wits end. Nothing happened. I decided on something I had never done before with an adult. I excused myself, went up to my apartment and came down with “Catcher in the Rye.” I brought him a table and ashtray, set down the book (why the hell didn’t I ask him to autograph it?) and suggested he do anything he pleased. Read to himself. Read aloud or just smoke.
  </p>
  <p>
   If I’d thought he was going to be so damned famous, I’d have written down everything we talked about to get the expression we did. I took 48 5×7 negatives. Serious, thoughtful, smiling, laughing, howling with laughter. White shirt, white background. Black suit, black background. But I don’t remember a thing.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Another clue —  although it is far a conclusive piece of evidence —  is Salinger loved to smoke, but was known for enjoying cigarettes, not pipes.

 <p>
  We were also unable to locate any credible sources confirming that Salinger regularly wrote in the nude, unlike Loam, who evidently had no compunction about writing or being

  in the
