  The Obama administration has directed the military to not allow personnel to say “Christmas,” in spite of the holiday’s status as a federally-recognized holiday.

 <p>
  The reason given by armed forces officials is that not everyone celebrates Christmas and that out of respect for them, military members should refer to Christmas celebrations simply as “holiday”-themed festivities.

  This prohibition comes in the context of a wider push for political correctness in society in general and the military in particular, as evidenced by the recent reprimanding of Navy Chaplain Wes Modder for simply discussing religion, as chaplains are wont to do, with military personnel. This blanket ban on Christmas in the military has apparently been in the works for sometime.
