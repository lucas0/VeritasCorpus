  In March 2017, an image parodying the many heartstring-tugging items that are circulated on Facebook — along with exhortations to viewers to “like,” “share,” or add an “amen” to them — itself gained wide currency via social media. The image featured a photograph of a man who was purportedly mugged while delivering comic books to his sick daughter:

  Of course, the pictured man’s wounds did not stem from a mugging, and the pictured girl is neither sick nor the man’s daughter.

  This viral meme most likely originated as a joke on the
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ComicBookCollecting/permalink/1339987279400666/?match=bm9lIGdhcnph" target="_blank">
   Facebook
  </a>
  group “Comic Book Collecting,” but the image managed to fool some social media users who were unfamiliar with the
  <em>
   X-Men/Wolverine
  </em>
  film franchise.

 <p>
  Similar japes have circulated on the internet in the past, such as a photograph from the movie
  <em>
   <a href="http://www.snopes.com/vietnam-veterans-tropic-thunder/" target="_blank">
    Tropic Thunder
   </a>
  </em>
  that was shared as an image of Vietnam veterans, a clip from the movie
  <em>
   <a href="http://www.snopes.com/man-hit-by-raft/" target="_blank">
    Grown Ups 2
   </a>
  </em>
  that was shared with the claim it depicted a dangerous accident in a toy store, and a clip from the movie
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/shark-attack-the-shallows-movie/">
   <em>
    The Shallows
   </em>
  </a>
  shared as if it depicted a genuine shark attack.
