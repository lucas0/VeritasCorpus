  Facebook page shared a video that seemingly showed a simple machine automatically sorting hundreds of small balls by color along with a request for someone to explain how the device worked:

  Some viewers theorized that the video (which can be viewed in full below) was actually upside down and and showed  colored balls in separate containers falling and mixing together through the machine. Others suggested that the device actually

   sorted

  the balls by size, not color.

  The truth, however, is that this machine doesn’t exist. The viral video is a computer simulation that was originally

  They originally ran the simulation with all white balls. When the objects all settled, they assigned each ball a color and ran the program again. Or as the_humesiter

   Run the simulation. Color the balls afterwards. Render from the beginning.

  Here’s the original video of the “somewhat flawed Galton Box”:
