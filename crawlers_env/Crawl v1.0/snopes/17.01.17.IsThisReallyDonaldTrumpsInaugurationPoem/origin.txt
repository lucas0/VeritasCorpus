<blockquote>
 <p>
  Come out for the Domhnall, ye brave men and proud,
  <br>
   The scion of Torquil and best of MacLeod!
   <br/>
   With purpose and strength he came down from his tower
   <br/>
   To snatch from a tyrant his ill-gotten power.
   <br/>
   Now the cry has gone up with a cheer from the crowd:
   <br/>
   “Come out for the Domhnall, the best of MacLeod!”
  </br>
 </p>
 <p>
  When freedom is threatened by slavery’s chains
  <br/>
  And voices are silenced as misery reigns,
  <br/>
  We’ll come out for a leader whose courage is true
  <br/>
  Whose virtues are solid and long overdue.
  <br/>
  For, he’ll never forget us, we men of the crowd
  <br/>
  Who elected the Domhnall, the best of MacLeod!
 </p>
 <p>
  When crippling corruption polluted our nation
  <br/>
  And plunged our economy into stagnation,
  <br/>
  As self-righteous rogues took the opulent office
  <br/>
  And plump politicians reneged on their promise,
  <br/>
  The forgotten continued to form a great crowd
  <br/>
  That defended the Domhnall, the best of MacLeod!
 </p>
 <p>
  The Domhnall’s a giver whilst others just take,
  <br/>
  Ne’er gaining from that which his hands did not make.
  <br/>
  A builder of buildings, employing good men,
  <br/>
  He’s enriched many cities by factors of ten.
  <br/>
  The honest and true gladly march with the crowd
  <br/>
  Standing up for the Domhnall, the best of MacLeod!
 </p>
 <p>
  True friend of the migrant from both far and near,
  <br/>
  He welcomes the worthy, but guards our frontier,
  <br/>
  Lest a murderous horde, for whom hell is the norm,
  <br/>
  Should threaten our lives and our nation deform.
  <br/>
  We immigrants hasten to swell the great crowd
  <br/>
  Coming out for the Domhnall, the best of MacLeod!
 </p>
 <p>
  Academe now lies dead, the old order rots,
  <br/>
  No longer policing our words and our thoughts;
  <br/>
  Its ignorant hirelings pretending to teach
  <br/>
  Are backward in vision, sophomoric in speech.
  <br/>
  Now we learnèd of mind add ourselves to the crowd
  <br/>
  That cheers on the Domhnall, the best of MacLeod!
 </p>
 <p>
  The black man, forgotten, in poverty dying,
  <br/>
  The poor man, the sick man, with young children crying,
  <br/>
  The soldier abroad and the mother who waits,
  <br/>
  The young without work or behind prison gates,
  <br/>
  The veterans, wounded, all welcome the crowd
  <br/>
  That fights for the Domhnall, the best of MacLeod!
 </p>
 <p>
  Whilst hapless old harridans flapping their traps
  <br/>
  Teach women to look and behave like us chaps,
  <br/>
  The Domhnall defends the defenseless forlorn;
  <br/>
  For, a woman’s first right is the right to be born.
  <br/>
  Now the bonnie young lassies that fly to the crowd
  <br/>
  Have a champion in Domhnall, the best of MacLeod!
 </p>
 <p>
  But for all his great wisdom, the braw gallant man
  <br/>
  Is matched by his children, the handsome Trump clan,
  <br/>
  And the flower of Europe, Melania the fair,
  <br/>
  Adds a luster and grace with her long flowing hair.
  <br/>
  May they flourish and prosper to form a great crowd
  <br/>
  Around the good Domhnall, the best of MacLeod!
 </p>
 <p>
  Is there man left in Scotland, without base alloy,
  <br/>
  Who remembers the Wallace, the Bruce, or Rob Roy?
  <br/>
  Or have five hundred years of a blasphemous lie
  <br/>
  Robbed your manhood of might that you lay down and die?
  <br/>
  Get up and walk free, all ye brave men and proud!
  <br/>
  Long life to the Domhnall, the best of MacLeod!
 </p>
