  The 75-year-old claim[ed] he shot Blackburn in self defense after Blackburn and

  Billie Wright kicked at his door.  Soles faced charges of assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury.  Blackburn has since recovered from the shooting.

 <p>
  During the trial, the state used a 40-minute surveillance tape taken at Soles’ home during the time of the shooting as evidence.  The state said Blackburn, Wright, and a woman spent more than an hour trespassing on the senator’s property, drinking alcohol before kicking the door.

 <p>
  Soles’ attorney, Joe Chesire, said the state gave a fair account of what happened the night of the shooting, and that the senator wanted to take responsibility for his actions.  He will pay more than $1,000 in court costs.
