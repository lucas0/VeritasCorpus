  Cases are being reported daily that its happening only to girls and that the Ice-cream truck has attempted to kidnap some girls but has failed due to the amount of people around. Chloroform is an organic compound with formula CHCl3. It is a colorless, sweet-smelling, dense liquid. It has been used before as a kidnapping agent where the criminal puts the cloth over its victims face and the person will then pass out. By using it in ice-cream it works 10 times faster and the girl is subject to being injured very badly due to falling and hitting her head. The ice-cream trucks that were reported to the police were said to have the writing ” Mr Ice Cream Man ” and another reported was ” Mr Softy “.

  Parents are advised to be with their children if they want to give them ice-cream as this is a very serious matter storming your area this summer. Please SHARE this with your friends and family and make sure it does not happen to you. Police are working on the matter to try and catch the perpetrators.
