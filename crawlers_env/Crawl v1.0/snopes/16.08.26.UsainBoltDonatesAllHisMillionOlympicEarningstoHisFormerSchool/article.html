  On 24 August 2016, the web site TheGuard1an.com published an article reporting that Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, a nine-time Olympic medalist, had donated all of his “$20 million Olympic earnings” to his high school in Jamaica:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Usain Bolt returned to Jamaica after winning gold medals at the Rio Olympics and has donated all the $20 million he earned to his high school William Knibb Memorial in Falmouth, Jamaica.
  </p>
  <p>
   This donation is to help the school’s athletic programs, according to the Jamaica press. The programs were in danger because of financial cuts.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  This report was a work of fiction. The Guard1an is a fake news site that masquerades as a real news site by using a URL similar to that of a legitimate news publication, in this case the UK newspaper
  <em>
   The Guardian
  </em>
  . As the former’s disclaimer warns, however these two entities are not related:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   TheGuard1an is an online satirical blog that covers global politics, business, technology, entertainment, science, health and media. It is accessible from over 1900 countries worldwide — now including South Sudan. Do not confuse yourself as we are no way affiliated to or connected to “The Guardian.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The Guard1an wasn’t the only fake news web site to publish a fabricated story about Usain Bolt following his performance at the 2016 Olympic Games. Onetainment.com posted a similar false report about Bolt’s supposedly donating his income to construct a new stadium in Jamaica.

  Usain Bolt has indeed

   donated
  </a>
  significant amounts of money to similar efforts, just not to the scale posited by these fake news reports:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In 2015, Bolt gave $1.3 million to his former high school along with soccer and cricket gear. He’s provided the school with track and field equipment since he signed with Puma in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bolt opened a multi-sport playing field in Jamaica, raised funds for pediatric cardiac surgeries and partnered with Samsung to provide photography workshops to students.
  </p>
  <p>
   He even paid for a $4 million renovation to a local health center using the proceeds from a party he threw to celebrate breaking the 100-meter world record.
