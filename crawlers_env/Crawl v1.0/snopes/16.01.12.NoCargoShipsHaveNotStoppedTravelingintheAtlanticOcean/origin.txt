  Commerce between Europe and North America has literally come to a halt.  For the first time in known history,
  <strong>
   not one
  </strong>
  cargo ship is in-transit in the North Atlantic between Europe and North America.  All of them (hundreds) are either anchored offshore or in-port.  NOTHING is moving.
 </p>
 <p>
  This has never happened before.  It is a horrific economic sign; proof that commerce is literally stopped.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason commerce has stopped is simple: People are not buying things.   When people do not buy things, retailers do not sell things, so they do not order more goods for stock.
