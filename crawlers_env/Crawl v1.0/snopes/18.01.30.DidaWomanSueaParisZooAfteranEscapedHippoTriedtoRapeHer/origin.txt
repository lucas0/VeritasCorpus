  The Paris Zoological Park is being sued after a woman claims she was sexually assaulted by a hippopotamus that had escaped the zoo for only a few hours yesterday.
 </p>
 <p>
  The large semiaquatic mammal apparently was able to slip out of its enclosure last night after massive flooding and a fallen tree severely damaged the security fence.

  Geraldine Boudin, 54, owner of a bakery next to the Zoological Park, is suing the zooâ€™s administration after she claims she was sexually assaulted by the huge beast after she was returning home that night.
