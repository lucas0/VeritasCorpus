   As if the city of Houston hasn’t seen enough tragedy due to catastrophic flooding from Hurricane Harvey, things took a turn for the worse today after a U.S. Navy ship collided with a building in the downtown area.
  </p>
  <p>
   The ship was identified as an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer belonging to the Navy’s 7th Fleet.
  </p>
  <p>
   It was unclear why the destroyer was not able to see the building and take evasive action, or why it was over 20 miles inland and trying to navigate through a major metropolitan area.

  The featured photograph that accompanied the story is, unsurprisingly, fake. The real image was published in
