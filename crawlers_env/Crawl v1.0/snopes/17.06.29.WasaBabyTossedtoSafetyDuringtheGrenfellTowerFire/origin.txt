 <p>
  A lady appeared at the window gesturing, body language from what she was saying, “I’m about to throw my baby, please catch the baby.” And the baby, I think, was packed in some sort of bedsheet blanket. And she threw the baby. As the baby came down — and this was approximately from the ninth or tenth floor — a member of the public, a gentleman, ran forward and miraculously helped grab the baby.
