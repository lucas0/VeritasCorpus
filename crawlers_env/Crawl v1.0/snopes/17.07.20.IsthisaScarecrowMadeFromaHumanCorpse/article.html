    In the early 2000s, a man bought a ranch in Texas. He noticed a scarecrow in the middle of his land. He went up to it and smelt something rotting. He took the clothes off the scarecrow and discovered it was a human skeleton. This is the photo he took before authorities arrived.

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   This poor fellow trespassed on the wrong farmer’s property. He was beaten and tied to a scarecrow post with barbed wire, a burlap sack over his head, and left to die. He was still alive and conscious when the crows started to peck at him…
  </p>

  But he also explained that he used newspaper and masking tape to create the prop:

   Is there a how-to on your blog? I know that many of the techniques you used have probably already been presented somewhere or another; but I always like seeing how individual creations are made.
  </p>
  <p>
   No how-tos as of yet. I first learnt to make this stuff from SpookyBlue’s amazing tutorials, and I’ve just been experimenting with different hands, ribcages and so on.

   Did you corpse an existing piece, or was this prop built from scratch?

   Built from scratch. Newspaper and masking tape.
