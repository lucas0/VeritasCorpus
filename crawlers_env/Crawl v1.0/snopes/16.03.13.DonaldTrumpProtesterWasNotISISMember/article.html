  On 12 March 2016, Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump posted a video on Twitter along with a message stating that Thomas DiMassimo, a protester who was

  at his rally in Dayton, Ohio, had ties to ISIS:

   USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail!

  The above-displayed video, however, has nothing to do with a terrorist organization. The video was originally uploaded to DiMassimo’s YouTube page on 29 April 2015 and shows a protest at Wright State University concerning the death of Eric Sheppard:

  DiMassimo’s video did not feature Arabic music, did not begin with a photoshopped image of a man holding a gun, and originally included an English caption:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Students at Wright State University #NotMyFlag protest. The protest occurred to stand in solidarity with the symbolic actions of Eric Sheppard.
  </p>

   Furthermore, the caption included with the video posted by Donald Trump did not state that DiMassimo was a member of ISIS or that the footage was taken at an ISIS rally. Instead, the caption mocked DiMassimo and made a crude remark about his genitals.

   In summation, the video posted by Donald Trump linking protester Thomas DiMassimo to ISIS is a hoax. The video features real footage from a April 2015 Black Lives Matter protest, but the Arabic music, caption, and photoshopped image of a man holding a gun, were all added after the fact in order to falsely tie the protester to a terrorist organization.
