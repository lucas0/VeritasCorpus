  Born into a prominent New York family, Chase worked a plethora of odd jobs before he moved into comedy and began acting with National Lampoon. He quickly became a key cast member in the inaugural season of Saturday Night Live, where his weekend updates soon became a staple of the show. Chase appeared on Saturday Night Live once again in 2013 and was joined by old time “SNL” hosts Paul Simon, Tom Hanks, Alec Baldwin, Candace Bergen, Steve Martin, Martin Short and Dan Aykroyd.
