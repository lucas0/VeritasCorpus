   The crash Feb. 4, 2015, killed 43 people and injured 14 others. The aircraft’s dramatic fall from the sky was captured on video, which showed the plane swooning across a bridge, where it clipped a taxi before falling into the Keelung River below. The taxi driver also suffered serious injuries, and a passenger had minor injuries.
