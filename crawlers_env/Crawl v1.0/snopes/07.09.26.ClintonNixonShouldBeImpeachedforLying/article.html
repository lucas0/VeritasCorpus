  The irony of discovering that President William Jefferson Clinton, who lied to the public about his relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky, had once criticized President Nixon for “lying” and “betraying the trust of the American people” is obvious.  Although Clinton did express that sentiment, the wording of what he said has been exaggerated to heighten that irony, however.

  According to online rumors circulated back in 1998, at the height of the Watergate scandal in 1974, Clinton had said of then-President Richard M. Nixon that:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Yes, the president should resign. He has lied to the American people, time and time again, and betrayed their trust. He is no longer an effective leader. Since he has admitted guilt, there is no reason to put the American people through an impeachment. He will serve absolutely no purpose in finishing out his term; the only possible solution is for the president to save some dignity and resign.
