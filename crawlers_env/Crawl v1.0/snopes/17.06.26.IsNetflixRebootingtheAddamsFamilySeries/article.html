  In April 2015, a video purportedly showing a trailer for a reboot of the classic television series, the
  <em>
   Addams Family
  </em>
  went viral after it was posted on Facebook by the “Netflix Geeks” page:

   This video proved so popular that it has persisted for years, but it is not a genuine trailer for a new Netflix series. Instead, it is a fan-made video that uses clips from previous installments of the
   <em>
    Addams Family
   </em>
   (along with footage from unrelated films such as Guillermo del Toro’s
   <em>
    Crimson Peak
   </em>
   ) in order to show what a reboot of the classic series might look like.

  The video was originally posted to
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UDb_wCcFwY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   YouTube
  </a>
  by a user named Alexia Bertha, along with a message explaining that she had created the trailer to encourage Netflix to make a reboot of the
  <em>
   Addams Family
  </em>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   THIS IS FAN MADE VIDEO!!! All rights to any material belong to their respective owners.
  </p>
  <p>
   This video is not a deliberate falsification and has only an entertaining character.
  </p>
  <p>
   I used the Netflix logo to attract the attention of viewers and Netflix itself.
   <br/>
   Netflix already has experience in reboots. Perhaps The Addams Family will be one of them!
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Bertha, who has posted similar fictional teaser trailers to her YouTube page, also listed the various films and television series she used to create the teaser:
 </p>
 <blockquote>

 <p>
  Bertha’s fan-made trailer for a Netflix reboot of the
  <em>
   Addams Family
  </em>
  series proved popular, and it is not impossible that the streaming network might someday opt to revitalize the classic show. As of mid-2017, however, Netflix has not announced any plans to reboot the series.
