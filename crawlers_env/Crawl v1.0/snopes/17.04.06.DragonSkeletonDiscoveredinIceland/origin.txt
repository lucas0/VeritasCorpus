  It is probably no accident that Patrick Stewart, narrating Animal Planet’s “Dragons: A Fantasy Made Real,” sounds so much like Orson Welles. Tuning in to this film at any point tomorrow night between 8 and 9:30 could be a “War of the Worlds” experience.

  Like Welles’s “War of the Worlds” radio broadcast in 1938, a long fantasy news bulletin that convinced some Americans that Martians had actually landed in New Jersey, “Dragons” takes a fictional premise, announces it at the beginning of the show and then runs with it, with no further disclaimers.

  So when viewers hear “Half of all young males are killed in territorial battles” and “Their wings soak up heat like solar panels, another adaptation for life in this forbidding climate,” it’s easy to forget that this isn’t a serious documentary about a known species.
