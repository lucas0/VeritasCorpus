  Attempting to assign any kind of status to this 2007 collection of purported quotes by Hillary Rodham Clinton poses something of a problem.  All of them have appeared in print as things the former first lady and current
  <nobr>
   U.S. senator
  </nobr>
  from New York supposedly said (although some of them are missourced in the
  <nobr>
   example
  </nobr>
  reproduced above), but they are stripped of explanatory context (and/or accompanied by misleading explanations), and they range from scripted public statements to spontaneous private utterances, from reports by mainstream journalists to revelations by unnamed or anonymous sources to mere hearsay repetition of rumor.

  We have attempted to trace each entry back to its first print source, provide a reasonably full context for the given quote, and note where the print source came by its information:
