  In late November 2016, a claim appeared that the United Kingdom’s new £5 bank notes contain beef tallow, a potential cause for concern among vegetarians and vegans who try to keep their contact with meat and meat industry byproducts to a minimum.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Bank of England decided to switch in 2013, and
  <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/polymer/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">
   introduced
  </a>
  the new bills in September 2016.  It has
  <a href="https://www.thenewfiver.co.uk/" target="_blank">
   touted
  </a>
  the new pound notes (which are made from long-lasting and difficult to tear plastic polymers, rather than cotton paper) as cleaner, more durable, and better for the environment — as well as being far more difficult to counterfeit than their flimsier paper counterparts.
 </p>
 <p>
  We contacted the Bank of England to ask whether £5 bills (and the £10 and £20 notes that they will be rolling out later) contain beef tallow. A representative responded:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Thank you for your enquiry concerning the £5 polymer banknote, which has been passed to me for reply.
  </p>
  <p>
   We can confirm that the polymer pellet from which the base substrate is made contains a trace of a substance known as tallow. Tallow is derived from animal fats (suet) and is a substance that is also widely used in the manufacture of candles and soap.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  This is not the first time that the United Kingdom has implemented polymer notes, as BBC
  <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-25427663" target="_blank">
   reported
  </a>
  in 2013:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In 1999, Northern Bank of Northern Ireland issued a polymer £5 commemorative note celebrating the year 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   A plastic note was introduced in the Isle of Man in 1983 but was withdrawn in 1988 owing to problems with the ink.
  </p>
  <p>
   Adopters of the notes include Canada, whose last central bank governor – Mark Carney – is now the governor of the Bank of England.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Beef tallow is indeed a trace ingredient of the polymer used for the new £5 notes in the UK. However, their appropriateness for use by vegetarians and vegans remains entirely subjective.
