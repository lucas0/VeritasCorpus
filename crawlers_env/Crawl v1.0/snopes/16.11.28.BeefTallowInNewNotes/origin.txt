  Thank you for your enquiry concerning the Â£5 polymer banknote, which has been passed to me for reply.

 <p>
  We can confirm that the polymer pellet from which the base substrate is made contains a trace of a substance known as tallow. Tallow is derived from animal fats (suet) and is a substance that is also widely used in the manufacture of candles and soap.
