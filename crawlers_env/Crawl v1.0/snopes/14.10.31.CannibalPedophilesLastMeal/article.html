  This absurd item about a Texas “cannibal pedophile” death row inmate named Doug Stephener, who requested that his last meal before execution be a
  <nobr>
   (non-Asian)
  </nobr>
  <nobr>
   child — a
  </nobr>
  request that the state is now obligated to satisfy by procuring a corpse for
  <nobr>
   him — appears
  </nobr>
  to have originated as a hoax

   news item

  /petition on French-language web sites (hence the stiltedness of translated English-language versions).

  Moreover, the practice of allowing a condemned prisoner to choose his final meal is merely a courtesy that has traditionally been extended to those about to be executed for their crimes; no state mandates that all such requests
  <u>
   must

  be fulfilled, no matter how unusual, impractical, or costly they might be.  In fact, the state of Texas ended the provision of

  requests to inmates back in 2011 when a condemned man ridiculously asked for “two chicken fried steaks, a triple-meat bacon cheeseburger, fried okra, a pound of barbecue, three fajitas, a meat lover’s pizza, a pint of ice cream and a slab of peanut butter fudge with crushed peanuts,” then didn’t eat any of that bounty.
