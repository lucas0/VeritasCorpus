  On February 04, 2013, Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, addressed the Duma,  (Russian Parliament), and gave a speech about the tensions  with minorities in Russia :
 </p>
 <p>
  “In Russia live Russians.  Any minority, from anywhere, if it wants to live in Russia, to work and eat in Russia, should speak  Russian, and should respect the Russian laws.  If they prefer Sharia Law, and live the life of Muslims then we advise them to go to those places where that’s the state law.  Russia does not need Muslim minorities. Minorities need Russia, and we will not grant them special privileges, or try to change our laws to fit their desires, no matter how loud they yell ‘discrimination’. We will not tolerate disrespect of our Russian culture.  We had better learn from the suicides of America, England, Holland and  France, if we are to survive as a nation.  The Muslims are taking over those countries and they will not take over Russia.   The Russian customs and traditions are not compatible with the lack of culture or the primitive ways of  Sharia Law and Muslims.  When this honorable legislative body thinks of creating new laws, it  should have in mind the Russian national interest first, observing that the Muslim minorities are not Russians.

  The politicians in the Duma gave Putin a five minute standing ovation.
