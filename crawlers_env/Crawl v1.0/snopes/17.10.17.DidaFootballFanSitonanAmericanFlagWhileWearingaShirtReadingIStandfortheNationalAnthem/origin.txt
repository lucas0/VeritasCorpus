  Basically, me and my friend were walking around the stadium sometime during the 3rd quarter. There is a huge tv screen by the food carts right inside the stadium where people gather to watch. We went over there to check it out and we saw him spread the flag out and sit down.

  I thought it was too ironic so I snagged a picture. He sat on it for a few minutes before leaving.
