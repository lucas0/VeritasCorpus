  Armed with such observations, medical historian Robert Hudson of the University of Kansas closed the international gathering on a particularly frightening note. After describing the Black Death plague of medieval Europe, Hudson warned that “when we grant our existing knowledge of microscopic pathogens is deficient, we necessarily grant the possibility at least of the returns of a return of the great epidemics of the past…. the possibility exists that a deadly and common organism could emerge that is easily spread from person to person and that might be aloof to all available therapeutic and preventive methods.”

  “The Philadelphia event remains unsettling because it shows the very real limitations of our tools for investigating an apparently new microbial disease,” Hudson concluded.  “If we are to retain public confidence in the face of some future serious epidemic, it is important that our limitations remain widely understood. As a medical community, there is no cause to be humiliated by the Legionnaire’s affair, but it is altogether proper that we be humbled.”

  Chagrined by the events of 1976, the U.S. public health community looked to the future, for the first time in the late twentieth century, with a vague sense of unease.
