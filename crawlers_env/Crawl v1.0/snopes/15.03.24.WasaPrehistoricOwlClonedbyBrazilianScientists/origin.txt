  While scientists experiment with mother nature, they end up unearthing specimens from the past that they may end up wishing they had left alone, as these specimens could prove to be dangerous to our environment.

  Take the prehistoric owl that was cloned in Brazil for instance.

  Brian Christopher was the lead scientist at Fogarty International Center. He was doing a routine inspection on the bird. When he opened the cage, the owl immediately attacked, placing its foot on each shoulder and violently gouging out his eyes. He was rushed to Daher Hospital where hes in serious but stable condition, but Doctors say he lost both eyes and there are no chances of recovering his sight.
