  Another body found in a shallow grave in Arkansas has been tied to the Clintons. Marcia Ann Bosley, who was the head housekeeper at the Governor’s Mansion before she was mysteriously let go in 1985, has been positively identified after spending more than 3 decades in the ground.

  Bosley, who had no family when she was let go, was assumed to have left the area for other opportunities. She was never reported missing. According to the Hamilton County Coroner:
