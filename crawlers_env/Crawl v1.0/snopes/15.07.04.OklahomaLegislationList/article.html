  of 2007 declared that “It shall be unlawful for any person to transport, move, or attempt to transport within the United States any alien knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that the alien has come to, entered, or remained in the United States in violation of law, in furtherance of the illegal presence of the alien in the United States.” (As indicated by the title, this legislation was passed back in 2007, during the Bush administration.) Enforcement of that measure was suspended for four years by court challenges maintaining that it was at odds with federal law, but the measure was finally

In May 2010, the Oklahoma House defeated legislation that would have expanded DNA collection to include those accused (but not yet tried or convicted) of such crimes, and in October 2014 the

  “demanding the federal government cease and desist mandates beyond its authority as designated by the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.” This declaration was a resolution, not a law, and therefore was a symbolic act with no legal effect.

  In 2004 and 2005, the Oklahoma legislature passed statutes allowing employees to keep firearms in locked vehicles on company property after Weyerhaeuser reportedly fired eight workers who violated company policy by having guns in their vehicles at a mill in southeastern Oklahoma. Several companies challenged that law in a federal lawsuit which maintained the statutes were unconstitutional and were pre-empted by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, and in 2007 a U.S. District Judge barred enforcement of the statutes. However, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision in February 2009, ruling that it “interferes with Oklahoma’s police powers and essentially promulgates a court-made safety standard … Such action is beyond the province of federal courts.” A subsequent law passed in 2012 also allows employees to store
