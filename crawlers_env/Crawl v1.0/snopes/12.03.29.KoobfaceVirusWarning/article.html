  Koobface is a real piece of malware that began circulating in late 2008 via messages sent through social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace.  However, since mid-2010 warnings about Koobface circulated online have mutated into a versions which are largely hoaxes:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Virus spreading like wildfire on FaceBook!! It is a trojan worm called “koob face”. It will steal your info, invade your system and shut it down! Do NOT open the link “Barack Obama Clinton Scandal”! If “SmartGirl15” adds you, don’t accept it; it is a virus. If somebody on your list adds her  then  you get the virus too!! Copy and paste to your wall.

  Koobface is not “spreading like wildfire” on Facebook (social networking increased their protection in the wake of such malware outbreaks, so Koobface largely stopped using them as a means of transmission),  there is no evidence that Koobface was ever widely spread via “Barack Obama Clinton Scandal” messages, and the warning about “SmartGirl15” was just another updating of another long-running Internet

  arrived with subject lines such as “You look so amazing funny on our new video” and “You look just awesome in this new movie” and offered recipients links to video sites that appeared to contain movie clips.
