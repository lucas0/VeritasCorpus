  Authorities say someone managed to modify the famed Hollywood sign to read “Hollyweed” in an overnight act of trespass.

 <p>
  Sgt. Guy Juneau with the Los Angeles Police Department’s Security Services said the incident unfolded around midnight after a thrill-seeker climbed the mountain and threw two tarps over the “O’s” to make them appear like “E’s.” It was caught on city surveillance cameras.

  The Perrot family visiting from Australia said they noticed the sign from their hotel. At the time, it read “Hollywoed,” while city park rangers were switching it back.

  “We looked out this morning, and the Hollywood, the double O, there was actually only one E left,” Lia Perrot said.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sign was restored to “Hollywood” by 10:45 a.m. [the following morning]. It remains unclear who was involved in the incident, which was being investigated as a misdemeanor charge of trespassing, according to Los Angeles police.
