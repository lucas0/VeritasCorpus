  A photograph purportedly showing an “eerie and beautiful” Marilyn Monroe at rest for a final viewing in her funeral casket has been widely circulated online:

  This image is a “real” photograph in a sense, but not a photograph of the August 1962 event it’s claimed to depict. It actually captures a
  <a href="http://www.enquire.it/2012/06/18/paolo-schmidlinm-arte-milano-intervista/" target="_blank">
   sculpture
  </a>
  of Monroe created by Italian artist Paolo Schmidlin:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Even the most photographed woman in the world — such as an icon immortal Marilyn Monroe — there is a final image ending its short earthly parable and that could give meaning to this brief life.
  </p>
  <p>
   That’s why I wanted to represent it even as she rests in her coffin, in silence, finally at peace. The passions and sorrows of the world already so far away.
  </p>
  <p>
   A sleeping beauty contemporary vision that torments and delights at the same time. The enigmatic beauty of permanent abandonment.

  Although these photographs are imagined recreations, they may very well accurately

   represent
  </a>
  how the actress may have looked at the time of her burial. According to the
  <i>
   Los Angeles Times
  </i>
  , Monroe wore a green dress and scarf as she was laid to rest:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   As beautiful in death as in life, the actress lay in an open bronze casket during the non-denominational rites, wearing a simple green sheath dress and a green scarf around her neck.
  </p>
  <p>
   In her hand was a tiny bouquet of baby pink roses put there by (Joe) DiMaggio.
