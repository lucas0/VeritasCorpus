 <p>
  Easter is a time for remembering that Muslims killed Jesus, according to Donald Trump.

 <p>
  “People ask me why I don’t like Muslims, and I say ‘duh’, it’s because they nailed Jesus to the cross with those Muslamic nails of theirs. Page 545 of the Bible I think it is, there in black and white, Muhammad Pilate and his henchmen killing Jesus.”

 <p>
  “I don’t hear other candidates reminding Americans that Muslims killed Jesus. Is this yet another thing Hillary has conveniently forgotten? Lyin’ Ted Cruz says he’s a Bible man but he hasn’t mentioned it either – has he even read page 545??”
