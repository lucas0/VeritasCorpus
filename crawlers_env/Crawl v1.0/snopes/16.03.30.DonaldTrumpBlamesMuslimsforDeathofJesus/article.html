  On 26 March 2016, the entertainment web site
  <em>
   The Evening Harold
  </em>
  published an
  <a href="http://eveningharold.com/2016/03/26/donald-trump-says-hes-never-forgiven-the-muslims-for-killing-jesus/" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  reporting that Donald Trump said that he didn’t like Muslims because they were responsible for the death of Jesus:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Easter is a time for remembering that Muslims killed Jesus, according to Donald Trump.
  </p>
  <p>
   “People ask me why I don’t like Muslims, and I say ‘duh’, it’s because they nailed Jesus to the cross with those Muslamic nails of theirs. Page 545 of the Bible I think it is, there in black and white, Muhammad Pilate and his henchmen killing Jesus.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “I don’t hear other candidates reminding Americans that Muslims killed Jesus. Is this yet another thing Hillary has conveniently forgotten? Lyin’ Ted Cruz says he’s a Bible man but he hasn’t mentioned it either – has he even read page 545??”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Donald Trump never actually said this, as the
  <em>
   Evening Harold
  </em>
  only publishes fictional and satirical articles.

   All characters featured in the Evening Harold are  entirely fictitious, and any similarities to anyone living or dead are purely coincidental.

  <p>
   Frankly, if you can’t figure out the difference between real and imaginary this site is probably a bad idea for you, and it might be a good idea to write that down.

  This isn’t the first time that a fake news story has been written about Donald Trump and Jesus Christ. In February 2016, a
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/donald-trump-bashes-jesus/" target="_blank">
   rumor
  </a>
  circulated claiming (falsely) that Trump had called Jesus a “socialist loser.”
