In 1996, the Clinton administration signed into law the Food Quality Protection Act, which mandated regular scientific reviews and safety evaluations of existing pesticides based on children’s health safety benchmarks. One of the actions resulting from this review was a

  uses:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   This action comes after completing the most extensive scientific review of the potential hazards from a pesticide ever conducted. This action — the result of an agreement with the manufacturers — will significantly minimize potential health risks from exposure to Dursban, also called chlorpyrifos, for all Americans, especially children.

 <p class="p1">
  Following this ruling, the EPA additionally ruled that chlorpyrifos would remain classified as safe for use in other
  <i>
   agricultural
  </i>
  and
  <i>
   industrial
  </i>
  settings. This latter ruling resulted in a September 2007 petition to the EPA filed by the Pesticide Action Network of North America and the Natural Resources Defense Council, both of which jointly requested that the agency ban the pesticide or issue final rulings on their acceptable levels (legally termed “tolerances”) in food. In September 2015, the Ninth Circuit court of appeals
  <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2015/08/10/14-72794.pdf?mc_cid=388e88196e&amp;mc_eid=74148e0221" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    mandated
   </span>
  </a>
  that the EPA respond to this petition by either banning the chemical completely or issuing final rulings on tolerances of the chemical’s residue on food products by October 31, 2015.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Following this court order, the EPA conducted a lengthy review and delivered a
  <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=EPA-HQ-OPP-2015-0653-0001" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    proposal
   </span>
  </a>
  on 6 November 2015, which suggested — as requested by the petition — that all currently published tolerances regarding chlorpyrifos residue on food should be revoked:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   EPA is proposing to revoke all tolerances for residues of the insecticide chlorpyrifos [including] tolerances for residues of chlorpyrifos on specific food commodities; on all food commodities treated in food handling and food service establishments in accordance with prescribed conditions; and on specific commodities when used under regional registrations.
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   The agency is proposing to revoke all of these tolerances because EPA cannot, at this time, determine that aggregate exposure to residues of chlorpyrifos, including all anticipated dietary exposures and all other non-occupational exposures for which there is reliable information, are safe.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  In March 2017, before the EPA’s proposal was implemented, Scott Pruitt — the new EPA administrator under President Donald Trump —
  <a href="http://archive.is/XAUYw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    reversed course
   </span>
  </a>
  and argued the previous administration’s scientific rationale was dubious, denying the petition:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   In October 2015, under the previous Administration, EPA proposed to revoke all food residue tolerances for chlorpyrifos, an active ingredient in insecticides. This proposal was issued in response to a petition from the Natural Resources Defense Council and Pesticide Action Network North America. The October 2015 proposal largely relied on certain epidemiological study outcomes, whose application is novel and uncertain, to reach its conclusions.

 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  The decision to deny the petition faced renewed scrutiny because the CEO of Dow Chemical, Andrew Liveris, had been

  <p class="p3">
   Chlorpyrifos is a chemical from Dow Chemical Company. It came from the Nazis and is a nerve agent that does irreversible brain damage. It was supposed to be banned this year, but Trump decided to let it be used on fruits and vegetables. Dow gave Trump $1 million dollars.

    Mostly false.

  </strong>
  Chlorpyrifos is a specific chemical that belongs to a broader class of chemicals called organophosphates. While the Nazis were at the forefront of developing this broader class as both weapons and insecticides, they can not be credited with inventing chlorpyrifos specifically.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  In the 1930s, a German researcher named Gerhard Schrader at German chemical producer
  <a href="http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/economics/igfarben.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   IG Farben
  </a>
  (infamous for producing the gas most commonly employed at Nazi death camps) discovered that organophosphates

   <span class="s1">
    interact
   </span>
  </a>
  with cholinesterase, an enzyme that aids in the production of an important neurotransmitter in animals.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Originally this effect was explored as a way to produce an insecticide, but one of Schrader’s formulations, named “Preparation 9/91”, ended up being extremely toxic to humans. Schrader himself

  hospitalization as a result of his own interaction with it. This discovery was reported to Nazi authorities, who mandated that all German researchers report any scientific development that could have military applications to the regime.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Shrader’s discovery
  <a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/94/i41/Nazi-origins-deadly-nerve-gases.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

   </span>
  </a>
  to the discovery and production of some of the world’s most infamous organophosphate nerve gases, including Tabun and Sarin gases. Other countries, including Britain and the United States, also began research into organophosphates during WWII as weapons. After the war ended, research resumed into organophosphate use as an insecticide.

  </strong>
  That organophosphates can be toxic to humans is nothing new. The idea, in developing such a chemical for use an insecticide, is to engineer an organophosphate that is below the threshold for affecting the human nervous system (via its effect on cholinesterase, something scientifically referred to as
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3648782/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

  ) but is still toxic to insects.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  From a scientific standpoint, the main controversy surrounds the potential residual effects that chlorpyrifos may have on the neurological development of fetuses and young children, which some studies have documented even at levels well below what is currently considered acceptable. In their 2016 decision to ban all tolerances for the chemical on food, the Environmental Protection Agency stated:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   In summary, the EPA’s assessment is that the [Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health, CCCEH] study, with supporting results from the other 2 U.S. cohort studies and the seven additional epidemiological studies reviewed in 2015, provides sufficient evidence that there are neurodevelopmental effects occurring at chlorpyrifos exposure levels below that required for AChE inhibition.

   We investigated associations between [chlorpyrifos, CPF] exposure and brain morphology using magnetic resonance imaging in 40 children, 5.9–11.2 y, selected from a nonclinical, representative community-based cohort.

  <p class="p3">
   Following a review of comments on both the November 2015 proposal and the November 2016 notice of data availability, EPA has concluded that, despite several years of study, the science addressing neurodevelopmental effects remains unresolved and that further evaluation of the science during the remaining time for completion of registration review is warranted to achieve greater certainty as to whether the potential exists for adverse neurodevelopmental effects to occur from current human exposures to chlorpyrifos.
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   EPA has therefore concluded that it will not complete the human health portion of the registration review or any associated tolerance revocation of chlorpyrifos without first attempting to come to a clearer scientific resolution on those issues. As noted, Congress has provided that EPA must complete registration review by October 1, 2022. Because the 9th Circuit’s August 12, 2016 order has made clear, however, that further extensions to the March 31, 2017 deadline for responding to the Petition would not be granted, EPA is today also denying all remaining petition claims.

  As a result of Trump and Pruitt’s actions, chlorpyrifos will continue to be allowed to be sprayed on food items, but it should be noted that this represents no change in current policy; it merely blocks what would likely have been the implementation of a change that would have otherwise taken effect in March 2017.

President Donald Trump, who did receive a significant amount of money from Dow Chemicals for his inauguration, unilaterally reversed this decision through his administrator Pruitt’s actions.
