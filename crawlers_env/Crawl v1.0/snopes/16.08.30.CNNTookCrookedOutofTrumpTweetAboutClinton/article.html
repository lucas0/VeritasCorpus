  During the CNN news program “Newsroom” on 28 August 2016, the cable news station showed a graphic image quoting a tweet authored by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump — but the graphic aired by CNN was missing an insult Trump habitually includes when talking about his opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton:

  <p dir="ltr" lang="en">
   I think that both candidates, Crooked Hillary and myself, should release detailed medical records. I have no problem in doing so! Hillary?
  </p>
  <p>
   — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)

  which called CNN the “Clinton News Network” in its 29 August 2016 post on the topic:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   It is not the job of a legitimate news network to remove adjectives to make Hillary more palatable. Of course, CNN is not a real news network, they are far left globalist propaganda news as they have proven once again.
