  The Federal Communications Commission, acting on an executive order issued by Barack Obama, fined the ABC television network for airing A Charlie Brown Christmas, because several overtly Christian references were found to be “potentially damaging, offensive and exclusionary” to non-Christians, according to a Commission spokesperson.

 <p>
  We respectfully submit a request to halt future network-based airings of the referenced work A Charlie Brown Christmas unless and until equal time is granted for non-Christian and/or secular programming.
