  The trigger for the latest clash of cultures was the publication by the Danish newspaper
  <i>
   Jyllends-Posten
  </i>
  on September 30 [2005] of 12 cartoons of Muhammad. A biographer of the prophet had complained that no one would dare to illustrate his book, and the newspaper challenged cartoonists to draw pictures of the prophet in a self-declared battle for freedom of speech.One submission showed Muhammad wearing a bomb-shaped turban; in another he tells dead suicide bombers that he has run out of virgins with which to reward them. Any portrayal of Muhammad is blasphemous in Islam, lest it encourages idolatry.

  In October [2005] ambassadors from ten Muslim countries complained to Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Danish Prime Minister, who refused to interfere with the pressâ€™s freedom.

 <p>
  But the issue began to boil [in January 2006] after the cartoons appeared in
  <i>
   Magazinet
  </i>
  , a Christian newspaper in Norway, and on the website of the Norwegian newspaper
  <i>
   Dagbladet
  </i>
  .
