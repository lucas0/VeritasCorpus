  On 12 July 2016, the web site
  <em>
   Cream Bump Daily
  </em>
  published an article reporting that a white billionaire had offered $1 billion for NBA star Lebron James and tennis champion Serena Williams to “breed”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   He wants a SUPER BABY! A White Billionaire Offers LeBbron and Serena $500 million a piece to BREED a baby…
  </p>
  <p>
   With his sperm and her egg. I’ll make my investment back on signing day.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  There was no truth to this story, which originated with an entertainment web site that does not publish factual stories.   A disclaimer at the bottom of the article states that the
  <em>
   Cream Bump Daily
  </em>
  is “Number One in Parody and Satire.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This isn’t the first time that a fake news article has claimed that a billionaire was offering major money for a child. In August 2015, a false
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/billionaire-baby-james-horton/" target="_blank">
   rumor
  </a>
  held that a billionaire was recruiting 1,000 women to have his children in an attempt to create the largest family ever.
