   debates
  </a>
  over “religious freedom” and “

   bathroom bills
  </a>
  ” continued to smolder, primarily focusing on the passage of a controversial piece of legislation in

   North Carolina
  </a>
  known as
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/nc-bathroom-bill-opposition-leader-a-sex-offender/" target="_blank">
   HB2

   Bruce Springsteen

  canceled upcoming shows in North Carolina in protest over HB2.

 <p>
  Not long afterwards, the United Kingdom’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office
  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/usa/local-laws-and-customs" target="_blank">
   issued
  </a>
  a formal

   travel advisory
  </a>
  to British citizens regarding “local laws and customs” in the United States that posed a potential danger to gay and transgender travelers:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The US is an extremely diverse society and attitudes towards LGBT people differ hugely across the country. LGBT travellers may be affected by legislation passed recently in the states of North Carolina and Mississippi. Before travelling please read our general travel advice for the LGBT community. You can find more detail on LGBT issues in the US on the website of the Human Rights Campaign.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  While some readers appeared skeptical of the advisory’s authenticity, a visit to the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s “Foreign Travel Advice”

   page
  </a>
  for the United States demonstrates that the warning is genuine.
