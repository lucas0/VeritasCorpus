  Five aircraft carriers, four big-deck amphibious assault ships, a full cast of “small boy” surface warships, along with nuclear submarines and support ships, are crowding the [Norfolk] base, giving a comfortably snug feeling to the waterfront.

But many of these ships will be gone in two weeks as the pace of operations picks up again.
