  On 23 August 2017, the

  Facebook page posted a widely-shared message about Cleveland Browns running back Isaiah Crowell.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   This is Isaiah Crowell! He plays for the Cleveland Browns and this is the picture he posted on Instagram! As long as he is allowed to remain in the NFL I will not watch or attend another game! He is a piece of dog shit!
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The post was accompanied by a photograph of Crowell and a screenshot of an artist’s rendering of a hooded man cutting the throat of a police officer.

  We received several enquiries from readers wanting to know whether Crowell did, in fact, post this image to his Instagram account.
 </p>
 <p>
  He did, on 6 July 2016. He deleted the image after a few minutes and later apologized repeatedly, to the satisfaction of local police. There has been a certain amount of skepticism on social media about the story because the post is no longer on Crowell’s Instagram feed — but that’s because it was removed, not because it was never there.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, many took screenshots of the image, which Cromwell posted with the brief message: “They give polices [sic] all types of weapons and they continuously choose to kill us. #Weak.”
