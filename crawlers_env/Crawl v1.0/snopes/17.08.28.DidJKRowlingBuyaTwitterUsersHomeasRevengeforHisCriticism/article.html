  On 23 August 2017, comedy web site
  <a href="http://archive.is/oVMrp" target="_blank">
   Funny or Die
  </a>
  posted an article appearing to report that
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  series author J.K. Rowling had taken vengeance on a Twitter critic by buying his home. “Two years ago,” the article says, “Rowling tweeted this, in support of refugees coming to Europe.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The article includes the following, which is a real tweet posted by Rowling in September 2015:
 </p>
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
  <p dir="ltr" lang="en">
   If you can’t imagine yourself in one of those boats, you have something missing. They are dying for a life worth living.

   The tweet picked up enough traction for Rowling to notice. So she tweeted this back at him, and most people assumed she was messing around.

   I’d type a longer retort, but these diamond buttons really hurt my fingers.

  The article veers into satire at this point with an entirely fabricated tweet. J.K. Rowling never responded to @lukekocura, vowing that she would own his “shack” within two years. Nor did she then follow up two years later, bitterly inviting @lukekocura to visit his former home. The article also includes several details about “Luke Kocura”, all of which are entirely fabricated for comedic effect.

  Despite being published on a comedy web site, the Funny or Die article appears to have fooled plenty of
