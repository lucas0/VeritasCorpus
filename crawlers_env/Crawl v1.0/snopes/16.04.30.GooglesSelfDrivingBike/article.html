   This spring, Google is introducing the self-driving bicycle in Amsterdam, the world’s premier cycling city. The Dutch cycle more than any other nation in the world, almost 900 kilometres per year per person, amounting to over 15 billion kilometres annually. The self-driving bicycle enables safe navigation through the city for Amsterdam residents, and furthers Google’s ambition to improve urban mobility with technology. Google Netherlands takes enormous pride in the fact that a Dutch team worked on this innovation that will have great impact in their home country.

  Facebook page. The Calimero version of the video has been viewed over 5 million times since then (nearly three million times more than the original video on Google Netherlands), on a site that makes no mention of an April Fools’ Day joke.

  Although Google Netherlands likewise made no specific reference to April Fools’ Day when they originally posted the video, they did include a link to a “making of” video that showed the “self-driving” bicycle concept to be a hoax:
