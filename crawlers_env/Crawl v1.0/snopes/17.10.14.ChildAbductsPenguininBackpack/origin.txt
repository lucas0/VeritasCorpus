  Friends of one of Mark’s work colleagues have a
  <nobr>
   12 year
  </nobr>
  old son with Down’s Syndrome. A couple of weekends ago they had a family trip to Drayton Manor, a West Midlands theme park &amp; zoo. Wandered round for a bit, and son saw the log flume – wanted a go. Told not now, you’ll get soaked, we’ve no dry clothes with us, maybe later. No arguments. Carried on going round the park.
 </p>
 <p>
  One happy day later and they are thinking of going home. Son asks if he can have
  <nobr>
   20 minutes
  </nobr>
  on his own. As he’s apparently a good, savvy kid, who has been sensibly independent on previous occasions, they agree, but with strict lectures about where and when he is to meet Mum and Dad. He wanders off, Mum &amp; Dad pack up the picnic. Cometh the hour, cometh no son. Parents a little concerned. When an hour has passed, searching hasn’t found him and they’re getting really scared. A soaking wet figure comes in to view. Wet from head to toe, backpack dripping, shoes squelching, beaming. Lecture given. Helpful staff thanked. Family returns home.
 </p>
 <p>
  When they get home, son is directed straight upstairs to have a bath. He’s 12 and shy now, so goes up alone. Parents sit down with a cup of tea and breathe a huge sigh of relief. All of a sudden, a very strange, disturbing noise comes from the bathroom. They charge upstairs, burst through the door to be confronted by

  old son and… a penguin.
 </p>
 <p>
  He caught a penguin, put it in his backpack and brought it home.
 </p>
 <p>
  Father ‘phoned the park. They thought he was winding them up. He insisted he wasn’t. They weren’t at all sure, but went away to count the penguins. They believed him. The penguin was returned, surprised, but unharmed. Didn’t seem to mind travelling in a backpack – all dark, penguin goes to sleep. Park staff apparently OK once the son’s condition was made clear. Not sure if he’s still welcome there, though. Certainly won’t be wandering on his own for a while by all accounts.

  I have a really funny story to tell you. Someone I know works for the Mentally disabled. This one bloke (bless him) is 25 yet has the mental age of someone who is 12. Anyway, they took a group of disabled people to Drayton Manor a couple of days ago. Unfortunately the group of helpers lost this bloke, he just wondered off. They eventually found him Drenched from head to toe with a massive coat on…appartley he had gone into the water on the log flume or something, so he told them. They managed to get him onto the coach. After a while on the coach…. All of a sudden he unzipped his coat and pulled out a live penguin!!!! It was a dwaf one! They had to turn the coach around and return the penguin! Its true!
