  A video clip of WABC-TV Channel 7 “Eyewitness News” in New York City opened last night with Anchorman Joe Torre saying “more on Hillary Clinton’s Death.” The opening line, however, seems edited-OUT of the video archive!

 <p>
  Did Hillary die after leaving the 9-11 Ceremony in New York … and the information is being concealed? A whole slew of irregularities have cropped-up indicating that may actually be the case!

   BODY DOUBLE?

 <p>
  A short time later, a person ALLEGED to be Hillary, is seen leaving the East 26th Street home of Chelsea Clinton,  but there are problems with this person.

  Notice the body weight?  Clearly, this person is significantly thinner than Hillary appeared just two hours earlier at the 9-11 memorial ceremony.  Moreover, the gait of this person is dramatically different than the gait of Hillary Clinton seen just two hours earlier.  It’s almost as though this “Hillary” is ten years younger, with a strong, assured stride, versus the slower, meandering walk usually displayed by the real Hillary.
