 <p>
  Former First Lady of Philippines, Imelda Marcos, the widow of Ferdinand Marcos, the 10th president of the Philippines is reported dead few hours ago after she collapsed in her residence.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to Dr. Marieta De Luna, the Former First Lady was rushed to the Manila Medical Centre in Ermita wee hours of today, but died shortly just during when the doctors were attending to her.
 </p>
 <p>
  “A team of doctors including myself worked tirelessly, we did all we could but couldn’t materialise.”-Dr. Marieta said.
  <br>
   “The cause of her death is not immediately known as autopsy report is yet to be released.”- She added.
  </br>
 </p>
 <p>
  So far the best guess could be cardiac arrest … Our condolence to the bereaved family and to the entire Philippian community.
