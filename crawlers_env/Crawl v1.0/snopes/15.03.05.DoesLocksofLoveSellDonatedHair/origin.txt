  Today I got a HUGE surprise! As I was preparing our Baby Girl Shiloh’s hair to send to Locks of Love some of my wise friends informed me that they charge patients for their hair and not to give them Shiloh’s hair.
 </p>
 <p>
  Me: I asked, “patients with cancer? That we are donating hair to?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Friends: “Yes! Could charge them $1000.00.”
 </p>
 <p>
  So I just called and talked to Locks of Love and sure enough they charge people for the hair that is being donated to them!!
 </p>
 <p>
  Me: “Y’all charge? People with cancer? My 9 year old is giving u her hair!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Lady: Well, depending on how much money the family has …”
 </p>
 <p>
  Me: “Wow. Thanks, have a great day!”

  Recently I cut off a little over 11 inches of my hair and was interested in donating it to an organization who would make good use of it. Hair donation is important because it costs approximately $1,800 for a complete hair replacement. Locks of Love is one of the most popular groups for hair donation but after research I was highly disappointed. They use less than 1/3 of the hair they receive from donations. They should not be considered a charity but a for-profit business because they do not give hair to those in need, they SELL it. Not only do they make children pay for their wigs, but they make them jump through hoops just to receive one. They are known to deny wigs to children with dim prognosis’ because they would not get enough use from the wig.

  I looked for other organizations after reading about Locks of Love. Pantene Beautiful lengths is a non-profit charity that accepts hair 8″ and longer for donation, their hair replacements go to adults.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wigs for Kids is another private non-profit group that specializes in hair replacements for children.
 </p>
 <p>
  Doing your research before donating anything is extremely important because you don’t want to help empower corrupt “charities”
