  Paparazzi camped out at the Obama mansion in DC noticed a bunch of activity last night after the government shutdown was finalized. Most notable, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, along with a host of other Democrats and at least a few Republicans, showed up for a “shutdown party” that wouldn’t soon be forgotten.
 </p>
 <p>
  The party was hosted by the Obamas but featured the planning committee of liberal losers Seth Rogan, James Franco and Alec Baldwin, who brought 14 cases of Dom Perignon and “more cocaine than any one man should possess.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The party went well into the wee hours of the morning and insiders confirmed that Pelosi and Schumer, who have been rumored to have been having an affair for more than 25 years, did a ton of coke and ended up in the master bathroom Jacuzzi together.
