  Harrison Ruffin Tyler, one of those grandsons, spoke to us from

   Sherwood Forest
  </a>
  Plantation, the historical Tyler family home in Virginia in which he resides. Harrison Tyler is not an immortal vampire, or a 160-year-old freak of nature, but a mentally sharp octogenarian with a soothing Southern drawl and a more favorable opinion of his grandfather’s legacy than the ones held by most presidential historians.

 <p>
  Q: It’s a really interesting story that you’re still, you know, around. Could you just explain how this happened? How someone born in 1790 still has living grandchildren?
 </p>
 <p>
  A: Well, he was a good man! [laughs] Both my grandfather — the president — and my father, were married twice. And they had children by their first wives. And their first wives died, and they married again and had more children. And my father was 75 when I was born, his father was 63 when he was born. John Tyler had fifteen children — eight by his first wife, seven by his second wife — so it does get very confusing. I really do not know — it’s amazing how families drift apart. When I was a child, I did know most of the descendents, but as you get more generations down the line, it’s hard to keep track of everybody.

 <p>
  Q: So, when you tell people that you’re the grandson of President Tyler, what kind of response do you get? Do they always believe you? Or do people sometimes think you’re making it up?
 </p>
 <p>
  A: I don’t know, I don’t bring it up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Q: Never comes up?
 </p>
 <p>
  A: See, I don’t bring it up, so, that question doesn’t come up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Q: When people come and take tours of the house, you don’t ever come out and say, “Hey! I’m John Tyler’s grandkid!”?
 </p>
 <p>
  A: [Laughs] Not that way, no. I am sometimes called the great-grandson — we have to correct that.
