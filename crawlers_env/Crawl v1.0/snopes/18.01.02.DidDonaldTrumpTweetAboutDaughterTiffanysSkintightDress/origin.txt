  I’m just a regular guy who loves to see people smile by writing Donald Trump parody. I do this by myself (no team of writers), and during my free time; and trust me, it can be time consuming and mentally draining (imagine if you forced yourself to intentionally read about where Donald Trump is, watch videos of him, and read what he says every day). If you’ve gotten some value (or at least a few laughs) from @RealDonaldTrFan, I hope you’ll consider buying me a beer or a cup of Covfefe through Patreon to help me keep going.
