  Although this GIF is often shared in jest during major storms and hurricanes, it is frequently posted alongside genuine clips of reporters braving the dangerous weather, leading some to falsely believe that this is a genuine clip of a weather reporter getting hit by a stop sign.

  The footage, however, comes from a 2006 episode of the television show

   This isn’t the only video purportedly showing a weather reporter getting hit by a stop sign. In December 2015, a very similar video went viral, this time featuring Irish weather reporter Teresa Mannion:

  Although Mannion is a real reporter, she wasn’t actually hit by a stop sign during a storm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mannion’s original report was broadcast on “

  k” during Storm Desmond in December 2015. Her emotionally charged reporting, coupled with some very obvious, yet necessary, pieces of advice (“don’t swim in the sea”), made Mannion an overnight viral sensation:

  Internet users turned her into a

  </a>
  her original report, and on 6 December 2015 ,YouTube user Gerard Walsh uploaded the video above featuring Mannion getting hit by a stop sign at the end of her report.

 <p>
  Although Mannion has repeatedly
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VziGCR5f2Q" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   confirmed
  </a>
  that the video is fake, this video continues to circulate during major storms. It took another lap around the Internet in September 2017 amidst a series of massive tropical storms and hurricanes:
