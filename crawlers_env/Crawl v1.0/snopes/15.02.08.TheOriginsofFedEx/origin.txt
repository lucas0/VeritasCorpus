  A young person informed me that FedEx began when a college professor told his class to come up with a business plan which would work. A student submitted a plan for FedEx, although I’m not sure he named it so, and the professor allegedly told the student that he had failed, because, as was told to me, “My book says it won’t work.” The student, determined to prove that the professor was wrong, started the company. My young source tells me that at the home office of FedEx, there hangs on the wall the original business plan.
