  In late January 2017, President Donald Trump signed an
  <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states" target="_blank">
   executive order
  </a>
  restricting U.S. entry by foreign nationals from seven “countries of particular concern” for 90 days. Although the text of order did not specify which countries it referred to, a

   fact sheet
  </a>
  issued by the Department of Homeland Security issued a fact sheet that identified them as Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Somalia, Libya and Yemen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shortly after issuance of the executive order, a chart (displayed above) was circulated via social media that was a modified version of a graphic published by the
  <a href="https://www.cato.org/" target="_blank">
   Cato Institute
  </a>
  , a libertarian think tank. The think tank
  <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/five-reasons-congress-should-repeal-trumps-immigrant-refugee-ban" target="_blank">
   argued
  </a>
  that persons from the countries included in the order did not pose a serious threat to Americans, as no such foreign nationals had ever carried out a lethal terrorist attack in the United States:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Refugees and immigrants from Muslim-majority countries are not a serious threat to Americans. The order would ban all people entering the United States from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, and Yemen, and yet no terrorist from these places has carried out a lethal attack in the United States. Indeed, no Libyans or Syrians have even been convicted for planning such an attack. Moreover, the likelihood of being killed by any refugee from any country is just 1 in 3.64 billion a year. This discrimination is arbitrary and cannot be rationally justified based on a assessment of the risk.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Cato tallied the number of Americans killed in the United States by foreign-born terrorists (categorized by country) and found that nationals from the seven countries included in President Trump’s order had not been responsible for any deaths on American soil between 1975 and 2015:

   <em>
    I compiled a
    <a href="https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/terrorism-immigration-risk-analysis" target="_blank">
     list
    </a>
    of foreign-born people who committed or were convicted of attempting to commit a terrorist attack on U.S. soil from 1975 through 2015. Below is a table with the distribution of their countries of origin (Figure 1). The first seven countries are those to be initially and, hopefully, temporarily denied visas. During the time period analyzed here, 17 foreign-born folks from those nations were convicted of carrying out or attempting to carry out a terrorist attack on U.S. soil and they killed zero people. Zero Libyans or Syrians intended to carry out an attack on U.S. soil during this time.
