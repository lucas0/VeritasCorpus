  After Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis was invited to the State of the Union by some Republican putz who clearly thinks purposefully disobeying the United States Constitution is worthy of an invite, President Obama has made sure she doesn’t forget her crime of refusing to treat everyone equally under the law.

 <p>
  Surrounding Davis will be four happily married same-sex couples who were married in Kentucky. Obama felt it would be poetic justice for the law-breaker, and if she’s going to be there anyway, might as well make her suffer in the bounty of same-sex love.
