  On 28 March 2016, the comedy sketch show
  <em>
   Studio C
  </em>
  published a video purportedly showing a collegiate volleyball match between men’s teams from UNC and Yale in which one of the Yale players, Scott Sterling, repeatedly turned back opponents’ spikes by deflecting the ball with his face:

  Soon afterwards, the video was shortened into GIF form and circulated online, with many of the elements identifying the video as a comedy sketch (such as the comedic announcers and the opening logo) stripped away, which led some viewers to believe that this was actual footage of a college volleyball match and not something created for a comedy show.

  This isn’t the first time that
  <em>
   Studio C
  </em>
