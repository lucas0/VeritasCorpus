  provides this advice on avoiding being victimized by such scams:
 </p>
 <ul type="DISC">
  <li>
   If you receive a questionable or unsolicited text message, check the URL or phone number for free on the Better Business Bureau
   <a href="http://www.bbb.org/" target="_blank">
    website
   </a>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Most financial institutions, utility, or other business will not communicate with you via text message. If you do not recognize the website or phone number being sent to you, don’t visit or call it.
  </li>
  <li>
   Don’t e-mail or text personal and financial information.
  </li>
  <li>
   Review your credit card and bank statements to make sure there are no unauthorized charges.
