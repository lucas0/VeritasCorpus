  In April 2016, a meme was published by the Facebook page “The Other 98%” (among others) holding that 643,000 Americans declare bankruptcy over medical bills every year, while in a number of other first-world countries, bankruptcies over medical bills are non-existent (due to the implementation of national social health insurance/medical care systems in those other countries):

  At the fine print at the bottom of the meme was a citation: “Source:
  <em>

  .” No link to the specific analysis referenced was provided, but presumably the

  in question was a 19 July 2013 item published by
  <em>
   NerdWallet
  </em>
  pertaining to medical bankruptcies. However, in that analysis
  <em>
   NerdWallet
  </em>
  repeatedly stated that their findings were “estimates” or “extrapolations,” and some of their data were quite old even back in 2013.
 </p>
 <p>
  The primary portion of that article held that:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “In 2013 over 20% of American adults are struggling to pay their medical bills, and three in five bankruptcies will be due to medical bills. While we are quick to blame debt on poor savings and bad spending habits, our study emphasizes the burden of health costs causing widespread indebtedness. Medical bills can completely overwhelm a family when illness strikes,” says Christina LaMontagne, VP of Health at NerdWallet. “Furthermore, 25 million people hesitate to take their medications in order to control their medical costs. Unfortunately this can lead to even worse financial outcomes as preventative treatments are not rendered and patients end up using expensive ambulance and ER care as their health worsens.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, many question whether President Obama’s universal health insurance mandate will protect Americans from problems with medical bills. “Insurance is no silver bullet,” says LaMontagne. “Even with insurance coverage, we expect 10 million Americans will face bills they are unable to pay.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Although the “643,000” figure didn’t expressly appear in that article, if we take the number of

  filings in the U.S. in 2013 (1,032,236) and apply
  <em>

  ‘s statement that “three in five (60%)  bankruptcies will be due to medical bills,” then we arrive at a number of medical bill-related bankruptcies (619,342) reasonably close to the 643,000 figure (although technically a bankruptcy filing can represent more than one person).

  Likewise, a 2013 CNBC
  <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100840148" target="_blank">
   item
  </a>
  based on the 2013 NerdWallet Health Analysis included a chart showing the estimated total number of medical-related bankruptcies in the U.S. in 2013 to be 646,812, which is also quite close to the cited 643,000 figure:
