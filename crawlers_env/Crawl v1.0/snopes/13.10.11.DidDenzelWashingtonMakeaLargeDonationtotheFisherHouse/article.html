  In mid-December 2004, Denzel Washington (reportedly at the suggestion of a veteran known as “Ranger Jones” whom the actor met while filming the 1988 Civil War epic
  <i>
   Glory
  </i>
  ) paid a visit to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas.  The popular actor took part in a Purple Heart ceremony, presenting medals to three Army soldiers who were recovering in the hospital from wounds received in Iraq.

 <p>
  The city’s

  newspaper described one of the medal recipients’ reaction to her encounter with the screen star:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   When Academy Award-winning actor Denzel Washington entered the auditorium at Brooke Army Medical Center,
   <nobr>
    Spc. Connie
   </nobr>
   Spinks, healing from wounds from Iraq, was content to hold his hand, get a gentle peck on the cheek and hear him whisper a sweet nothing in her ear.
  </p>
  <p>
   “He just told me he was proud of me, and that was enough,” said Spinks, who has a broken femur, fractured fibula, shattered ankle, two broken fingers and second- and third-degree burns on her hands and face.
  </p>
  <p>
   That brief encounter was enough to lift the Asheboro, N.C., native, a world away from her memories of
   <nobr>
    Oct. 13,
   </nobr>
   when a suicide bomber killed two soldiers and injured Spinks, 22, and four others in a convoy.
  </p>
  <p>
   “If I wasn’t already in a wheelchair, I would have fainted” when the screen star kissed her, she said.
  </p>
  <p>
   Oh, but there was one more thing she needed. She waved her mother, Annette, up for a hug and kiss from the leading man, who has portrayed young military heroes in “Glory” and “Crimson Tide.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “I had to do that for my mother,” said Spinks, who will be treated at the hospital at least through March. “She’s been here for me since October.”

  essentially low-cost hotels built on the grounds of military medical centers in the U.S. and abroad that provide all the amenities of home and enable family members of servicemen

   to stay close to loved ones who are undergoing medical treatment for illness, disease, or injury.  The free accommodations at Fisher Houses make them accessible even to familes with tight budgets (a situation common to many military families).

  With the U.S. military’s having been engaged in combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq during the previous few years, the demand for space in Fisher Houses at some military facilities exceeded their capacities at the time Denzel Washington visited to Fort Sam Houston in
  <nobr>
   December 2004.

  According to the Fisher House Foundation, the actor did visit the facility’s Fisher House and learn of its need for additional facilities, and he did later make a substantial donation to the Fisher House Foundation.   However, the story became a bit exaggerated with the addition of claims that

  “got out his checkbook” on the spot and wrote a check for the full amount needed to construct a new building:

   <em>
    Hi everyone,
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   Dan told me a great story he heard and I wanted to share it with the rest of you. Pleaaase spread the word!
  </p>
  <p>
   Danzel Washington was visiting BAMC (Brookes Army Medical Center, in San Antonio) the other day. This is where soldiers that have been evac’d from Germany come to be hospitalized in the States. They have buildings there called Fisher Houses. The Fisher House is a hotel that soldier’s families can stay at, for little or no charge, while their soldier is staying in the hospital. BAMC has quite a few of these houses on base, but as you can imagine, they are almost filled to the brim most of the time. While Denzel Washington was visiting BAMC, they gave him a tour of one of the Fisher Houses. He asked how much one of them would cost to build. He got his check book out and wrote a check out for the full amount right there on the spot. The soldiers overseas were amazed to hear this story and want to get the word out to the American public, because it warmed their hearts to hear it. I hope you will spread this story!
