  This is a genuine photograph depicting the aftermath of Mandarin Airlines
  <nobr>
   Flight 642
  </nobr>
  from Bangkok to Hong Kong, which crashed upon landing on
  <nobr>
   22 August
  </nobr>
  1999.  The plane, an
  <nobr>
   MD-11,
  </nobr>
  encountered a
  <nobr>
   24-knot
  </nobr>
  crosswind coincident with
  <a href="http://www.drdisk.com.hk/sam.htm" target="_blank">
   <nobr>
    Typhoon Sam
   </nobr>
  </a>
  and came down too hard on its right side, causing the
  <nobr>
   No. 3
  </nobr>
  engine to hit the runway and the right wing to separate from the fuselage.  The
  <nobr>
   MD-11
  </nobr>
  rolled over and slid off the runway upside down, bursting into flame and grinding to a halt on a grassy area adjacent to the runway.
 </p>
 <p>
  Remarkably, there were only three fatalities among of the
  <nobr>
   300 passengers
  </nobr>
  and
  <nobr>
   15 crew
  </nobr>
  members aboard the flight.
