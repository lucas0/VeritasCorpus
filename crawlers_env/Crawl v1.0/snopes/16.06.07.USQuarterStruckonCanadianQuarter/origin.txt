  We all have loose change sitting around, despite our promises to ourselves to roll ’em and bring ’em to the bank–or at least deposit them in one of those sorting machines. And while it’s no surprise that many 200-year-old coins are worth more than the standard value, some 1970 quarters could be worth far more than 25 cents.

  How much more? How about a yearly salary’s worth!
