  More than 70 children have been reported missing in the past week in north-east Kansas, as lawmakers admit the city is gripped by a “child abduction epidemic.” According to reports, the epidemic of missing children began after three sisters went missing from a northeast Kansas foster home on Aug. 26.

  Since then, an unprecedented number of missing children cases have been reported in recent weeks, with the situation becoming critical in the last few days.
