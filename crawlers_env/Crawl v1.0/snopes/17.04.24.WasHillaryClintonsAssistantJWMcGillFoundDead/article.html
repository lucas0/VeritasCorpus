  to enhance their political careers grew a little bit longer in April 2017 when the web site geopolitica.ru published an

   Johnston Wilson McGill, 34, was pronounced dead on his couch by a private doctor after suffering an apparent heart attack. It has happened just days after being summoned to appear before Trey Gowdy’s congressional committee to testify about Hillary Clinton’s email server. McGill was one of Clinton’s aides. The death was reported hapanned [sic] at her home of “natural causes.”

   Does this whole thing seem a little bit odd to anyone else? It feels oddly like we’ve seen things like this happen before to people who could possibly incriminate Hillary Clinton. Unfortunately, as the doctor who pronounced has an impeccable record and is an authorized coroner in new York, the findings will be accepted and entered into public record.

  In addition to the satirical origins of this story, we also found several holes in this claim. For one, we found no record of a Johnston Wilson McGill working on Hillary Clinton’s staff, or any genuine news reports about his alleged death. Furthermore, Trey Gowdy concluded his investigation into the
