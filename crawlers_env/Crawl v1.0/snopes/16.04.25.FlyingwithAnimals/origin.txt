  A Seattle woman who was flying to San Francisco to spread her husband’s ashes took her 25-pound pet turkey on the flight for emotional support. Jodie Smalley, 34, says her turkey, Easter, has been there for her since her husband passed away from cancer three months ago. She had a custom diaper made for Easter for their flight, and she has all the necessary documents that certify the turkey is a legitimate emotional support animal. “Hearing about a turkey on a plane sounds ridiculous,” she said. “But people have no idea what I’ve been through.”
