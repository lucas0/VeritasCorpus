  Hillary Clinton is really worried about something. On Monday afternoon, FBI and local law enforcement surrounded a Clinton Foundation office in Ettleboro, North Dakota.

  Authorities arrested Jon Crawford, 23, and Elizabeth Palmer, 27, for allegedly tampering with evidence. The FBI received a tip from within the Clinton Foundation office that some staffers were shredding documents and that two hard drives had been taken from the office in defiance of the order from the Congressional Committee.
