  Florida Georgia Line is an American country music duo; Brian Kelley and Tyler Hubbard, best known for their songs “Get Your Shine On”, “Cruise” and “Your Brother’s Kinda Cute.”

  Brian Kelley “BK”, spoke to the Scooper about the upcoming wedding.

  “For years people have called our music, ‘brokeback country’, I guess we finally made it official.”
 </p>

  “Tyler and I have been a couple behind the scenes for years,” BK laughed. “We are tired of keeping it hidden. Plus, paying women to pose as our wives is no way to live.”
