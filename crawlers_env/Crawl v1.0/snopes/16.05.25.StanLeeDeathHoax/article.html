  In May 2016, a false rumor circulated via social media holding that Stan Lee, the famed Marvel Comics writer who had a hand in creating such legendary figures as Spider-Man, the Hulk, the Fantastic Four, Iron Man, Thor, and the X-Men, had passed away:

  The rumor sprang from a “prank” article published on the web site
  <em>
   Cult of Buzz
  </em>
  , which stated that the comic book creator had “dyed,” not “died,” at the age of 93:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Legendary Marvel Comics Writer Stan Lee, 93, Dyes Peacefully In His West Hollywood Home
  </p>
  <p>
   In a press release from his wife Joan Clayton Babcock Lee, it has been confirmed that the dark streaks you see in Lee’s hair are not natural.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Stan adores the public and loves all the fans. That being said he doesn’t like to discuss the fact that his hair is completely white now.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The punning title was lost on some readers who skimmed the article and came to the conclusion that Stan Lee had shuffled off this mortal coil.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stan Lee is still with us, however: No credible announcements have reported his passing, and the comic book icon is still active on

  <em>

  wasn’t the first publication to use the homophonic nature of the dye/die pairing to fool readers into believing that a celebrity had died. A nearly identical article published in September 2014 claimed that actress Betty White had “
