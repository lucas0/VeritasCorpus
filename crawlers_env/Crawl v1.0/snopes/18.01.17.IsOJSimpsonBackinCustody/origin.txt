 <p>
  OJ Simpson was arrested late Tuesday evening at a nightclub outside of Oxenflood, New York, just south of a little-known Canadian border crossing upstate. Simpson, who was armed with a pistol and a knife, was carrying a fake Canadian passport and nearly $400K in cash.
 </p>
 <p>
  He would have slipped across the border unnoticed with his established coyote friend from town who knows all of the US Customs officers at the border, which consists of what looks like a four-lane tollbooth, had he not stopped for a drink.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was there in town that someone recognized him after everyone involved had too much to drink. “OJ Simpson!: said the townie, “What’s it like to kill somebody?” Simpson didn’t take kindly to the answer and smashed a beer bottle across the poor kid’s head.
