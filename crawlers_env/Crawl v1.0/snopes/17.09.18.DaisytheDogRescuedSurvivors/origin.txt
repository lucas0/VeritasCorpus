 <p>
  This is a true story which happened on 9-11-01.
 </p>
 <p>
  James Crane worked on the 101st of Tower 1 of the World Trade Center.
 </p>
 <p>
  He is blind so he has a golden retriever named Daisy. After the plane hit 20 stories below, James knew that he was doomed, so he let Daisy go out as an act of love. With tears in her eyes she darted away into the darkened hallway. Choking on the fumes of the jet fuel and the smoke he was just waiting to die … About 30 minutes later, Daisy comes back along with James’ boss, who Daisy just happened to pick up on floor 112.
 </p>
 <p>
  On her first run of the building, she leads James, James’ boss and about 300 more people out of the doomed building.
 </p>
 <p>
  But she wasn’t through yet, she knew there were others who were trapped. So, highly against James’ wishes she ran back in the building. On her second run, she saved 392 lives. Again she went back in. During this run, the building collapses. James hears about this and falls on his knees into tears.
 </p>
 <p>
  Against all known odds, Daisy makes it out alive, but this time she is carried by a firefighter. “She lead us right to the people, before she got injured” the fireman explained. Her final run saved other 273 lives. She suffered acute smoke inhalation, severe burns on all four paws, and a broken leg, but she saved 967 lives.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next week, Mayor Guilaini rewards Daisy with the Canine medal of Honor of New York. Daisy is the first civilian Canine to win such an honor.
