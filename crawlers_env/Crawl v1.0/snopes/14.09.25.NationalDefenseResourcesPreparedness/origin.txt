 <p>
  Note what this EO specifically orders:
  <i>
   identify, assess, be prepared, improve, foster cooperation
  </i>
  .  None of these items claim authority to seize private property and place them at the personal disposal of Obama.  What follows after
  <nobr>
   Section 103
  </nobr>
  are the directives for implementing these rather analytical tasks, mostly in the form of explicit delegations of presidential authority to Cabinet members and others in the executive branch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why the update?  If one takes a look at
  <nobr>
   EO 12919,
  </nobr>
  the big change is in the Cabinet itself.  In 1994, we didn’t have a Department of Homeland Security, for instance, and some of these functions would naturally fall to DHS.  In
  <nobr>
   EO 12919,
  </nobr>
  the FEMA director had those responsibilities, and the biggest change between the two is the removal of several references to FEMA (ten in all).   Otherwise, there aren’t a lot of changes between the two EOs, which looks mainly like boilerplate.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, that’s almost entirely what it is.  The original EO dealing with national defense resources preparedness was issued in 1939
  <nobr>
   (EO 8248)
  </nobr>
  according to the National Archives.  It has been superseded a number of times, starting in 1951 by nearly every President through Bill Clinton, and amended twice by
  <nobr>
   George W.
  </nobr>
  Bush.
 </p>
 <p>
  Obama has added to Section 201(b) the phrase “under both emergency and non-emergency conditions.”  In 12919, though, the duties of the Cabinet Secretaries were not limited to emergency situations in
  <nobr>
   Section 201(b),
  </nobr>
  either.  And in both EOs,
  <nobr>
   section 102
  </nobr>
  specifically notes that the EO is intended to ensure defense preparedness “in peacetime and in times of national emergency.”
 </p>
 <p>
  [T]he timing of this release might have looked a little strange, but this is really nothing to worry about at all.
