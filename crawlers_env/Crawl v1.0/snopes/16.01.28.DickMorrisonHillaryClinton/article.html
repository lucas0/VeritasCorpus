  Circulation of the above-quoted e-mail, attributed to political commentator Dick Morris, has escalated sharply as the 2016 presidential election draws nearer, but this item began making the online rounds several years ago.   Often titled “Bill Clinton’s Loving Wife” or “The Truth About Hillary Clinton,” this piece has circulated in a number of

  As the message’s introduction section frequently states, Dick Morris worked closely with the Clinton White House as a

  and strategist through much of Bill Clinton’s presidency. By the mid-2000s, Morris had became openly critical of both Clintons, and the item reproduced in the example field is similar in tone to his other Clinton-related

  “DICK MORRIS’ ’08 PLAY-BY-PLAY ANALYSIS Vol 1, #11” on 25 May 2007 and was framed as a point-by-point rebuttal by Morris of statements Bill Clinton made about Hillary as captured in a 2007 video:

  <p>
   Go to www.hillaryclinton.com and check out Bill Clinton’s syrupy five minute ad for Hillary. He introduces the commercial by saying that wants to share some things we may not know about Hillary’s background. His version of her biography is about as reliable as if it appeared in Pravda!
  </p>
  <p>
   So, I wanted to make a few corrections.

  </a>
  of this video reveals that Morris often misrepresented what Bill Clinton had actually said in the video and therefore ended up “rebutting” claims that hadn’t been made in the first place.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Bill says: Hillary never wanted to run for public office, but she did want to work at public service.
  </p>
  <p>
   The facts are: When Clinton was considering not running for another term as Governor of Arkansas in 1990, Hillary said she would run if he didn’t. She and Bill even had me take two surveys to assess her chances of winning. The conclusion was that she couldn’t win because people would just see her as a seat warmer for when Bill came back licking his wounds after losing for president. So she didn’t run. Bill did and won. But there is no question she had her eye on public office, as opposed to service, long ago.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Determining exactly what Hillary Clinton’s political aspirations might have been in the 1970s, or the 1990s, is rather difficult and subjective. However, determining what Bill Clinton actually said in the video is simple and doesn’t match what Morris asserted:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   [W]hen we met, over 35 years ago in law school, I was interested in public office, but she wasn’t. She thought she’d never run for anything. She was just interested in public service.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  In other words, Bill Clinton said that
  <strong>
   when he first met Hillary
  </strong>
  , back when both of them were law school students in the 1970s,  Hillary’s aspirations at that time didn’t include eventual election to public office. He didn’t say, as Morris misleadingly implied, that Hillary never changed her viewpoint on that subject at any time in the ensuing decades.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Bill says: In law school, Hillary worked on legal services for the poor.
  </p>
  <p>
   The facts are: Hillary’s main extra-curricular activity in law school was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent. She went to court every day as part of a law student monitoring committee trying to spot civil rights violations and develop grounds for appeal.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Bill Clinton’s specific words were: “In law school, [Hillary] worked for legal services for poor people,” a statement not very different from Morris’ paraphrasing. But Bill Clinton additionally stated that Hillary worked at the Yale Child Study Center during her law school years, an assertion matched by information found in sources such as a
  <a href="http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=43" target="_blank">
   biography
  </a>
  of Hillary Clinton hosted at the
  <em>
   The National First Ladies’ Library
  </em>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   During her second year in law school, Hillary Clinton volunteered at Yale’s Child Study Center, learning about new research on early childhood brain development, as well as New Haven Hospital, where she took on cases of child abuse and the city Legal Services, providing free legal service to the poor. Upon graduation from law school, she served as staff attorney for the Children’s Defense Fund in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Morris’ claim that “Hillary’s main extra-curricular activity in law school was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent” is partly true and partly an exaggeration.  As noted in our lengthy
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/clintons/panthers.asp" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  on this topic, Hillary was one of a number of Yale students who played a minor, tangential role in the trial of several Black Panthers (accused of murdering an informant) by organizing volunteers to monitor the legal proceedings for civil rights violations.  This activity was far from Hillary’s “main extra-curricular activity,” however: during her time at Yale, Hillary also worked at the Yale Child Study Center, took on cases of child abuse at Yale–New Haven Hospital, volunteered at New Haven Legal Services, served on Senator Walter Mondale’s Subcommittee on Migratory Labor, worked on the 1970 campaign of Connecticut U.S. Senate candidate Joseph Duffey, and interned at the Oakland law firm of Treuhaft, Walker and Burnstein.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Bill says: Hillary spent a year after graduation working on a children’s rights project for poor kids.
  </p>
  <p>
   The facts are: Hillary interned with Bob Truehaft [sic], the head of the California Communist Party. She met Bob when he represented the Panthers and traveled all the way to San Francisco to take an internship with him.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  This claim is a misleading non-sequitur.  Hillary both interned with a law firm that included Robert Treuhaft among its name partners while she was a Yale law student, and she performed a year of postgraduate study at the Yale Child Study Center after receiving her law degree.  Morris deceptively makes it sounds as if these activities took place at the same time and were therefore mutually exclusive.
 </p>
 <p>
  Morris’ emphasis on Robert Treuhaft’s former Communist connections is somewhat incongruent with what he stated in his 2004 book about Hillary Clinton,
  <em>
   Rewriting History
  </em>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Hillary was no Communist, nor should her work at the Treuhaft firm imply that she was
   </strong>
   ,” Morris wrote. “But the fact that she chose this job out of all the summer jobs that might have been available, traveling three thousand miles for it, tells something about her orientation at the time. Just as the fact that she does not describe the firm’s work or reputation says something about her today.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Morris’ column continued by stating:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Bill says: Hillary could have written her own job ticket, but she turned down all the lucrative job offers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The facts are: She flunked the DC bar exam and only passed the Arkansas bar. She had no job offers in Arkansas and only got hired by the University of Arkansas Law School at Fayetteville because Bill was already teaching there. She only joined the prestigious Rose Law Firm after Bill became Attorney General and made partner only after he was elected governor.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Again, this is a subject covered in a separate
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/clintons/barexam.asp" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  on this site which notes that Hillary indeed failed the Washington D.C. bar exam on her first attempt at it in 1973, but the circumstances were more complicated than suggested:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Even one of the most embarrassing episodes of Hillary’s young life, when she failed the Washington, D.C., bar exam, didn’t appear to result from a lack of discipline. She enrolled in a bar study class with a professor, Joseph Nacrelli, who had a reputation for knowing every nook and cranny of the D.C. test. But in 1973 the exam was in its second year of including a multistate portion that tested more generally on American law rather than just city-specific questions. Hearing the professor lecture on a topic they knew well, some of the students in the class determined that portions of the material he was teaching were wrong. Those students panicked because the bar would test them on subjects they hadn’t taken in law school. So they began to study those subjects independently, in addition to continuing the class, and they passed. It’s hard to know whether Hillary failed because she studied the wrong information — some of those who relied solely on the class made the grade.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Morris also deceptively reversed the nature of events to make it sound as if Hillary had no job prospects and was only able to obtain work in Arkansas due to the influence of her husband.  In fact, Hillary had significant prospects in Washington, D.C., but she passed them up in order to move to Arkansas and remain close to her beau, Bill Clinton:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   [Hillary] Rodham was viewed as someone with a bright political future: Democratic political organizer and consultant Betsey Wright had moved from Texas to Washington the previous year to help guide her career, and Wright thought Rodham had the potential to become a future senator or president. Meanwhile, Clinton had repeatedly asked Rodham to marry him and she continued to demur. After failing the District of Columbia bar exam and passing the Arkansas exam, Rodham came to a key decision. As she later wrote, “I chose to follow my heart instead of my head”. She thus followed Bill Clinton to Arkansas, rather than staying in Washington, where career prospects were brighter.
  </p>
