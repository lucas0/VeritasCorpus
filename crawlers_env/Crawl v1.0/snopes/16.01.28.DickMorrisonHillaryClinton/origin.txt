  BILL CLINTON LEAVES SOME THINGS OUT OF HILLARY’S BIOGRAPHY
 </p>
 <p>
  Go to www.hillaryclinton.com and check out Bill Clinton’s syrupy five minute ad for Hillary. He introduces the commercial by saying that wants to share some things we may not know about Hillary’s background. His version of her biography is about as reliable as if it appeared in Pravda!

  So, I wanted to make a few corrections.
