  The death of the legendary Merle Haggard has stunned the country music community. Haggard died Apr. 6 at age 79. Haggard is best known for his songs, “Okie from Muskogee” and “Working Man”. He also was part of the outlaw group of Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson and Johnny Cash.

  An even bigger shock came shortly after Haggard’s death when his lawyer read his last will and testament. Haggard left his entire estate to Interpride Enterprises, a Bakersfield, CA-based LGBT group that puts on Pride parades around the world. Many thought Haggard to be an ultra social conservative, but Haggard believed in equal rights.
