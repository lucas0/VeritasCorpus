  <p>
   Doctors at a Western Cape private hospital were surprised to see Kedder go into labor, as she didn’t know she was pregnant.

  <p>
   “It was even more of a shock when three tiny puppies came out instead of a baby,” said Dr. Brown of the Medical Center where Kedder gave birth to her ‘puppies’. “To be honest, we didn’t know this was possible. It’s both a marvel of modern medicine and extremely disturbing at the same time.”
