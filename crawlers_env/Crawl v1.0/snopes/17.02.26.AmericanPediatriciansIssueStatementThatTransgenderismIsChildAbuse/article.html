  On 16 May 2016, talk show host Glenn Beck published a tweet reporting that a pediatricians’ group had said that promoting or tolerating gender dysphoria (i.e., the condition of feeling one’s emotional and psychological identity as male or female to be opposite of one’s biological sex) in children constitutes “child abuse”:

  Beck’s tweet led many viewers to believe that the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) had taken that stance on childhood gender dysphoria, but the tweet linked to an

  containing quotes from the American
  <em>
   College
  </em>
  of Pediatricians (ACPeds) not the AAP:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The American College of Pediatricians recently issued a temporary position statement on so-called gender identity disorder, or gender dysphoria. A full statement will be issued this summer. The temporary statement is prefaced with the following:
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    The American College of Pediatricians urges educators and legislators to reject all policies that condition children to accept as normal a life of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex. Facts —  not ideology — determine reality.
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   “They say human sexuality is an objective, biological, binary trait, XY and XX are genetic marks of health, not genetic markers of disorders,” Co-host Pat Gray said on The Glenn Beck Program.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Now that seems to fit in with what, kind of, the politically correct crowd is saying right now, that gender is just a state of mind.”

  ACPeds is a very small group formed relatively recently in response to political disagreements over same-sex parenting, not out of any specific focus on pediatrics or the wellness of children (and the organization is classified as a

  by the Southern Poverty Law Center). By ACPeds’ own admission, their original
  <a href="http://www.acpeds.org/about-us" target="_blank">
   aim
  </a>
  was to promote parenting by heterosexual married couples:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Mission of the American College of Pediatricians is to enable all children to reach their optimal physical and emotional health and well-being. To this end, we recognize the basic father-mother family unit, within the context of marriage, to be the optimal setting for childhood development, but pledge our support to all children, regardless of their circumstances. The American College of Pediatricians promotes a society where all children, from the moment of their conception, are valued unselfishly. We encourage mothers, fathers and families to advance the needs of their children above their own. We expect societal forces to support the two-parent, father-mother family unit and provide for children role models of ethical character and responsible behavior.

  Beck’s material linked to a previous
  <a href="http://www.acpeds.org/the-college-speaks/position-statements/gender-ideology-harms-children" target="_blank">
   statement
  </a>
  issued by ACPeds (“Gender Ideology Harms Children”) that some social media users confused with a study. The statement opened with the portion Beck excerpted before issuing an eight-point initial platform on gender identity in children, which stated (among other things) that human sexuality is an objective biological binary trait, puberty-blocking hormones can be dangerous, and that rates of suicide are twenty times greater among adults who use cross-sex hormones and undergo sex reassignment surgery.
 </p>
 <p>
  The statement provided citations for its claims, including references to seemingly conflicting information from the respected American Psychiatric Association’s “Gender Dysphoria Fact Sheet”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In the upcoming fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), people whose gender at birth is contrary to the one they identify with will be diagnosed with gender dysphoria. This diagnosis is a revision of DSM-IV’s criteria for gender identity disorder and is intended to better characterize the experiences of affected children, adolescents, and adults … DSM-5 aims to avoid stigma and ensure clinical care for individuals who see and feel themselves to be a different gender than their assigned gender. It replaces the diagnostic name “gender identity disorder” with “gender dysphoria,” as well as makes other important clarifications in the criteria. It is important to note that gender nonconformity is not in itself a mental disorder. The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The APA’s position is that gender dysphoria is “not in itself a mental disorder,”  and that children are a demographic group at risk for compromised clinical care.  A part of ACPeds’ citation that bordered on deceptive was the fact that the American Psychiatric Association’s fact sheet discussed changes to diagnostic criteria implemented around 2013, but ACPeds went on to cite studies that were typically more than a decade old and in direct conflict with medical science directives issued several years (and several studies) later.

  from the American Academy of Pediatrics notes that treatment recommendations are based on the best available evidence. Their guidance defined three approaches to gender dysphoria in children: “corrective,” “supporting,” and “affirming,” with the AAP advising the “affirming” approach to gender dysphoria in children:
