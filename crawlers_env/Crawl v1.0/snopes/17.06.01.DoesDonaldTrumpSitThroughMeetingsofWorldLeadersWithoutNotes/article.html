  In May 2017, a meme appeared that seemed to show U.S. President Donald Trump at a meeting of G7 leaders in Italy, without notes or note-taking paraphernalia in front of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The G7, or Group of Seven, consists of leaders from seven industrialized democracies who regularly hold
  <a href="http://www.g7italy.it/en" target="_blank">
   meetings
  </a>
  to discuss issues such as energy policy, international security, and the global economy.  (Until 2014, the Group of Seven was the Group of Eight, but Russia was
  <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/group-seven-g7" target="_blank">
   suspended
  </a>
  from the group after its annexation of Crimea that year.)
 </p>
 <p>
  The image came with the following caption:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Trump, the only world leader without notes, folders, or writing tools in front of him. Because the man has a 10 second attention span.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  The photograph — which appears to have originally been tweeted by French President Emmanuel

   Macron
  </a>
  without the commentary on 26 May — also shows Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau without notes in front of him, although he does appear to have a pen. Similarly, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has no notes in front of her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Merkel is sitting immediately to Trump’s right, and Trudeau is sitting immediately to her right.

  The folder on which Macron is writing, two places to Trump’s left, is not his own. As the wording of his

  explains, it was an anti-terrorism agreement that was passed around the table and signed by each of the G7 leaders, including

  And finally, this official G7 Summit photograph shows Trump with a pen on the table in front of him:

  There is clear photographic and video evidence that shows this meme picked one snapshot from a meeting in order to claim that Trump did not use or read notes at the G7 round table meeting. The meme also ignored the two individuals sitting to his right in order to make the false claim that he was the only world leader in the photo without notes in front of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the G7 Summit, Trump was also accused of deliberately not wearing
  <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCJLandale/status/868418708502441986" target="_blank">
   headphones
  </a>
  carrying an English translation of Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni’s contribution. It turned out the President was just wearing a small
  <a href="https://twitter.com/PressSec/status/868449609873588224" target="_blank">
   earpiece

  , which was not visible in one particular video clip.
