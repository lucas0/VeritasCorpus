<blockquote>
 <p>
  In Indonesia, in the town of Toraja, a woman leaves her grave after being dead for 3 years.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately, this event was caught on camera and it’s the evidence of how this woman was resurrected after that much time.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is no doubt that this is a frightening and surprising fact.
 </p>
 <p>
  They say that in order to bring her back to life, a special rite is performed in the place of the woman’s tomb.
