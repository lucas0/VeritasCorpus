  To some observers, it looks like an ordinary grilled cheese sandwich. But to the Miami woman who put it up for sale on eBay, and to some people who viewed it, there was an image of the Virgin Mary seared on a seemingly run-of-the-mill snack.

  The psychological phenomenon that causes some people to see or hear a vague or random image or sound as something significant is known as pareidolia (
  <em>
   par-i-DOH-lee-a
  </em>
  ).
 </p>
 <p>
  The word is derived from the Greek words
  <em>
   para
  </em>
  , meaning something faulty, wrong, instead of, and the noun
  <em>
   eid≈çlon
  </em>
  , meaning image, form or shape. Pareidolia is a type of apophenia, which is a more generalized term for seeing patterns in random data.
