  In 1996, naturopathic doctor Peter D’Adamo published the

  which presented the hypothesis that diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes tailored to one’s blood type are an effective tool for weight loss, increased energy, and the reduction of myriad other ailments. This has popularly become known as the “blood type diet”, for which he is the primary proponent.

   </span>
  </a>
  and has created an entire industry built around the diet, including a series of follow up-books, cookbooks, a variety of blood tests for sale, and other supplements.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  There are many different ways to classify blood types, but the most common (and the primary one D’Adamo employs) is the ABO system, which is
  <a href="http://www.redcrossblood.org/learn-about-blood/blood-types" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    determined
   </span>
  </a>
  by the presence or absence of two genetically regulated antigens – A and B – attached to the surface of red blood cells. The four blood type groups are A, B, AB, and O.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Superficially, there might
  <a href="http://www.dadamo.com/txt/index.pl?3000" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    appear
   </span>
  </a>
  to be a wealth of complex, technical, and well-documented support for the concept. In addition to his popular books, D’Adamo has written numerous detailed blog posts describing how blood types might affect the body.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Much of the rationale presented on his website fits the following basic structure: there’s a study that shows or hints at various conditions correlating with blood type, therefore a diet tailored to blood type would be more helpful than a general one.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  To date, however, no peer-reviewed scientific literature has provided any evidence to support the latter class of arguments. This is a point D’Amado himself cedes. In response to a
  <span class="s1">

    study
   </span>
  </a>
  in PLOS ONE that was highly critical of his work,
  <span class="s1">
   he
  </span>
  <a href="http://www.dadamo.com/txt/index.pl?3030" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    stated
   </span>
  </a>
  (17 years after first publishing his book):
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   That the [blood type diet] theory is currently unproven by rigorous scientific study is not argued. Hopefully in time this can be rectified by studies which accurately and comprehensively prove or disprove the hypothesis.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  In lieu of accurate and comprehensive studies that prove or disprove his hypotheses, D’Adamo’s basic rationale is rooted primarily in four observations
  <a href="http://www.dadamo.com/txt/index.pl?1001" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    listed
   </span>
  </a>
  on his website:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p1">
   First, that people with different blood types appear to have differing susceptibility to a variety of illnesses; second, that people with different blood types produce and degrade differing amounts of the stress related hormones cortisol or adrenaline; third, that the antigens that determine your blood type are found in other places besides your blood; and fourth, that that blood type has a strong influence on an individual’s gut bacteria.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  There are indeed varying levels of scientific basis for the above claims. That blood antigens are found in the tissue of multiple systems is

  on the relationship between disease and blood type published in the journal

  concluded:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   There is accumulating evidence that the ABO blood group also plays a key role in various human diseases such as cardiovascular, neoplastic and infectious disorders. In the near future, probably many of the statistical associations observed between ABO and diseases will be re-assessed by [genome-wide association studies]. These studies have already confirmed some of the relations detected by targeted researches carried out long before the current era of genomics, such as those with [venous thromboembolism], [coronary heart disease], and pancreatic cancer.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  With respect to blood type and stress hormones (which play a big role in his lifestyle and exercise recommendations), D’Adamo cites a limited 1992 study of 15 white male veterans
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1438663" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    published
   </span>
  </a>
  in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine that showed differences in the production and removal of cortisone in A and O blood types.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  The gut bacteria connection is one of the most prominent aspects of his theory. Studies have indeed observed differences in the relative contribution of gut bacteria based on blood type. A

  published in BMC Microbiology that analyzed the gut flora and blood type of 79 Finnish volunteers found:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   That the ABO blood group is one of the genetically determined host factors modulating the composition of the human intestinal microbiota, thus enabling new applications in the field of personalized nutrition and medicine.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  Much of the dietary recommendations for the blood type diet are based on the concept of eating foods your body is naturally better at handling, as stated on D’Adamo’s
  <a href="http://www.dadamo.com/txt/index.pl?1001" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    website
   </span>
  </a>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   For example, the microbiome of certain people developed to break down carbohydrates much more efficiently (blood type A). People lacking this ability (blood type O) tend to store carbs as fat.

  Another key diet/blood connection
  <a href="http://www.dadamo.com/txt/index.pl?1007" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    promoted
   </span>
  </a>
  by D’Adamo stems from lectins — a group of proteins found in many foods — which he argues can mimic different blood-type antigens, and “interact” with your kidneys, liver, gut, stomach, or other organ systems:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   For the most part our immune systems protect us from lectins. Ninety-five percent of the lectins we absorb from our typical diets are sloughed off by the body. But at least 5 percent of the lectins we eat are filtered into the bloodstream, where they react with and destroy red and white blood cells. The actions of lectins in the digestive tract can be even more powerful. There they often create a violent inflammation of the sensitive mucous of the intestines, and this agglutinative action may mimic food allergies. Even a minute quantity of a lectin is capable of agglutinating a huge number of cells if the particular blood type is reactive.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  There are independent scientific
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1115436/pdf/1023.pdf" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    reports
   </span>
  </a>
  of potential ways that lectins might interact with different bodily systems to cause disease as described above, but no peer-reviewed research directly tests a potential link between those phenomena and the claim that a blood type based diet would ameliorate any of those potential mechanisms.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  A final aspect of D’Adamo’s blood type diet is the additional classification of a person’s “secretor/non-secretor status”. This is a classification independent of ABO blood type and refers to a person’s genetically-determined ability to
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2990383/" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    secrete
   </span>
  </a>
  blood type antigens into your saliva or mucus. In a 2001 paper in
  <i>
   Alternative Medicine Reviews
  </i>
  , he argued that this classification could have sweeping implications for human health:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   Understanding the clinical significance of ABH secretor status and the Lewis blood groups can provide insight into seemingly unrelated aspects of physiology, including variations in intestinal alkaline phosphatase activity, propensities toward blood clotting, reliability of some tumor markers, the composition of breast milk, and several generalized aspects of the immune function.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  The information summarized above provides a broad outline of the most commonly promoted scientific rationale for the blood-type diet, though there are pages and pages more written by D’Adamo on the topic. In essence there are a number of “seemingly unrelated” facts about blood that could, maybe, respond to different diet and exercise regimens.

  Such a study has yet to be released. On his website, D’Adamo has a section for scientific papers that support the science behind the diet. Nearly all of these self-authored papers are from the late 80s and early 90s, or are more recent blog posts written by D’Adamo.

  D’Adamo is certainly prolific, both in his numerous blogs and in his library of best selling books. Lost within that sea of complex jargon, speculative observations, and anecdotal tales, however, is the fact that there is no widely accepted or peer-reviewed evidence that modifying one’s diet to match blood type has any effect on one’s health.
