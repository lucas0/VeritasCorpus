  I know you are in business to make money. I know that fraudulent returns cut into your profit margin, so you feel the need to tighten up your return policies. I am totally on board with that.

  BUT, could you please then stop using disappearing ink on your receipts? I just had my baby shower, and EVERY SINGLE gift receipt from your store was so faded, it was barely legible. Then, you tried to give me a hard time because your computers couldnâ€™t read the receipts, therefore making my duplicates off the registry unreturnable (but improper registry maintenance is a whole other issue.)

 <p>
  To sum up. You require receipts? Then print legible receipts. Thank you.
