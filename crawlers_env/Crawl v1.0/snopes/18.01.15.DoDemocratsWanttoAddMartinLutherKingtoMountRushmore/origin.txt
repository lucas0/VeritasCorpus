  The halls of Congress were filled with intrigue Monday morning when ten Democratic Congressmen led by Muslim Keith Ellison demanded that Mount Rushmore — which features faces of U.S. presidents — be changed to accommodate a new face: a Communist and tax cheat  they view as a civil rights hero because he gave a few speeches that sounded nice.

  “Martin Luther King has done more for this country than most Presidents, especially the current one, and he should be honored for that,” Ellison said. “The best way to honor him is to make sure the entire nation sees his face on what is easily our most recognizable monument.”
