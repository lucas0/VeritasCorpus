  On 1 July 2016, the entertainment web site
  <i>
   The Global Sun
  </i>
  published a hoax news story, which reported that the restaurant chain Tim Hortons would start selling marijuana in 2017:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Canada’s most popular fast food restaurant franchise “Tim Hortons” will now be selling marijuana upon its legalization in Canada.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Tim Hortons has not announced any plans to sell marijuana. The story was nothing but a work of fiction from an entertainment web site:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Global Sun is a satire website, articles/post on the website are all made-up stories and should not be taken seriously.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The one grain of truth to the story is that Canada really is considering a law that would make the drug legal for recreational use:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Canada is moving to legalize pot in 2017, but don’t expect it to become a new Amsterdam for Americans hoping to get a legal high just across the northern border.
  </p>
  <p>
   Canada’s Liberal Party government will introduce a law next spring to legalize recreational marijuana, Health Minister Jane Philpott disclosed last week at the United Nations. She did not detail who would be allowed to grow or distribute cannabis products.
