  , reporting she narrowly avoided being abducted in the parking lot of a Walmart in Darboy, Wisconsin:

   Attention women!! Husbands, fathers,and brothers too!! Tell this story to everyone you know!!! Today (08/07/16) while leaving walmart in Darboy,WI at about 4:45pm a woman in her 20s approached me and in an embarrassed hushed tone said i started my period and i should come to her car and get her sweatshirt to tie around my waist and i could just keep it. To most this sounds like an innocent, kind hearted gesture from one woman to another but what she didn’t know is that i had a hysterectomy about 8 months ago…i can’t have periods. A guy the next row over heard me telling her i was fine and that I’m going straight home and she started to argue with me about coming to her car and he came over and said hey how’s it going long time no see and i played along for a moment thinking i possibly knew him from work and when i turned back to tell the woman that I’m not interested she was gone. The guy introduced himself as John Meldais(sp?) and said he’s up from Milwaukee visiting his mom and he’s a police officer. He explained to me that this trick is just one of many used to abduct unsuspecting women and he offered to stay with me while i contacted local police and gave my report. I’m grateful he was there today or who knows what might have happened! Ladies don’t believe anyone you don’t know! We see this on the news and feel awful for those involved but think it’ll never happen to us. Don’t be a victim!

  Erickson maintained that a woman attempted to lure her to the stranger’s vehicle under the auspices of sparing her (i.e., Erickson) further embarrassment due to the unexpected start of a menstrual period staining her clothes. However, Erickson said that she was surprised by the claim due to confirmed and permanent amenorrhea (i.e., absence of menstruation).

  As an alleged scheme for luring human trafficking victims, the scenario presented here doesn’t sound like a well-thought out one. Most women are roughly aware of when to expect their monthly cycles (or regularly use hormonal birth control, which regulates periods), and even if the bizarre proposal initially fooled a tiny pool of woman, those putative victims — already on the way back to their own cars — could simply hotfoot it home in their own vehicles and change clothes rather than visiting a stranger’s car to take someone else’s clothing

  The claim was already treading a line of dubious plausibility when it went on to include the presence of a visiting police officer within earshot. As is common in viral Facebook kidnap warning posts, the “ambient police officer” character provides the narrative service of explaining what was otherwise a perplexing interaction. Erickson stated that the traveling cop warned her that the “trick is just one of many used to abduct unsuspecting women” and offered to wait with her while she contacted police but did not himself intervene. (Had the officer been out of earshot, the anecdote likely wouldn’t have worked as a parable.)

  Erickson asserted that she was not just passing on a story, claiming that the incident personally happened to her on 7 August 2016:
