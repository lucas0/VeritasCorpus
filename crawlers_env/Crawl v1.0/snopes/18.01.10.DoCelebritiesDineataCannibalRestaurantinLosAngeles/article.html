   What do Katy Perry, Meryl Streep, Anderson Cooper and Chelsea Clinton have in common? They have all eaten human flesh at LA’s notorious cannibal restaurant, Cannibal Club.
  </p>
  <p>
   The private restaurant has long operated under the radar in Los Angeles, with rumors circulating about who has attended and what is really served behind closed doors. Now a leaked Cannibal Club document has exposed some of the notorious restaurant’s “elite” patrons.

  The web site also promotes a regular Friday and Saturday night show (the same event has been listed on the web site since 2009), but does not provide any information about where the supposed restaurant is actually located. The

  section attempts to explain this by saying that “it is necessary for us to operate privately and to vette [sic] our members in order to avoid disruption from the less enlightened.” Yet, we’re doubtful that this club could have a permanent (or even roving) physical location where they host concerts while simultaneously avoiding detection from the

  There’s no evidence that this “leaked” document actually came from a cannibal club in Los Angeles. Rather, it was likely created using digital editing software.
