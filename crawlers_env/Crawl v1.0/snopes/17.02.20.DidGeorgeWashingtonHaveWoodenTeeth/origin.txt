 <p>
  Dentures
  <br/>
  Worn by George Washington
 </p>
 <p>
  Lead base fitted with cow and human teeth, elephant ivory, brass, and steel. ca. 1775-1799.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although George Washington brushed his teeth regularly, by the time he took the oath of office as president at age 57, he was wearing full dentures.
  <strong>
   Contrary to popular myth, Washingtonâ€™s false teeth were not made of wood but of human and cow teeth as well as elephant ivory.
  </strong>
  The dentures required frequent adjusting to function naturally, and Washington repeatedly sent them to John Greenwood, his dentist in New York City, for repairs.
