  A video showing a hapless shopper being struck by an inflatable raft and thrown into an aisle of shelves at a department store is frequently shared online as genuine footage taken from a CCTV (closed-circuit television) security camera. One of the most popular versions, which has been viewed more than 10 million times, was posted by the Facebook group Vomitorium on 5 June 2016:

  This video, however, does not show genuine security camera footage taken at a department store. This clip is an excerpt the 2013 comedy film
  <em>
   Grown Ups 2
  </em>
  and shows actor Nick Swardson (or at least a CGI version of him) being hit by an inflatable raft:

  This certainly isn’t the first case of images from movies being circulated as genuine. A still from the movie

    Tropic Thunder
   </a>
  </em>
  was shared as a legitimate image of Vietnam soldiers, a picture purportedly showing “Arnold Schwarzenegger’s first day in New York” was actually taken from the movie

    Hercules in New York

  , and a clip purportedly showing a gruesome shark attack was actually taken from the movie
