  On 5 May 2015, President Barack Obama nominated United States Marine Corps General Joseph “Fighting Joe” Dunford to be the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), and General Dunford took over that position from Army General Martin Dempsey on 25 September 2015.

  attributed to Ray Starmann, reporting the supposed text of a speech General Dunford delivered announcing his resignation as chairman of the JCS.  It began:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, in concern for the lives of current and future US military personnel and to honor those who have gone before, I must speak to the nation today.
  </p>
  <p>
   I’ve called this press conference to announce that I am resigning as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and I am retiring after 39 years on active duty, which included combat service in Iraq leading the finest Marines in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   I am resigning as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and retiring from the Marine Corps for the following reasons:
  </p>
  <p>
   For the last seven years during the Obama Administration:
  </p>
  <p>
   I have watched and remained silent as hundreds of senior officers were forced to resign or were forcibly retired because of their disagreements with the current policies wrecking the military.
  </p>
  <p>
   I have watched and remained silent as people who have never served a day in uniform laid siege to the glorious traditions of the US military.
  </p>
  <p>
   I have watched and remained silent as male ROTC cadets paraded in red high heels, male soldiers conducted physical training wearing pregnancy simulators, combat units dealt with breastfeeding and lactation issues in the field and sensitivity training became the standard operating procedure of the US military.
  </p>
  <p>
   I have watched and remained silent as trans-genders were authorized to serve in the ranks, and three females graduated from the US Army Ranger School, under what I believe are the most dubious of circumstances.
