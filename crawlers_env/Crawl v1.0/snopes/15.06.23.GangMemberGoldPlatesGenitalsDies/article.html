  On 22 June 2015, the fake news web site
  <em>
   World News Daily Report
  </em>
  <a href="http://www.donotlink.com/fnp2" target="_blank">
   published
  </a>
  an article reporting that a gang member in Los Angeles had died after trying to gold plate his genitals:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   An L.A. gang member, Nazario Conchuza Gonzalez, who is part of the infamous Ms-13 gang, also called Mara Salvatrucha, has died of medical complications after attempting to gold plate his own genitals to celebrate his 17th anniversary.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 17-year old man who was allegedly a fan of the 2002 American comedy movie
   <em>
    Goldmember
   </em>
   , which is a loose parody of the James Bond films
   <i>
    Goldfinger,
   </i>
   had taken the Spanish nickname of “Pelotas de oro”, or golden testicles, before attempting to gold plate his own genitals to his ultimate demise.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dr Ian Joseffson of the Los Angeles Community Hospital warns of a growing trend within gang members to attempt the “deadly operation.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “I have no idea where this idea comes from but plating one’s own genitals will only ultimately end in serious medical complications or even death, as we have seen in this case”
