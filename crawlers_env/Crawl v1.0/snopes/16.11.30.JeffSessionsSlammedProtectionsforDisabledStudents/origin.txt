 <p>
  Senator Jeff Sessions’ old remarks about disabled students are raising concerns from disability advocates who fear he will not enforce federal special education law if he becomes the next U.S. Attorney General.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sessions said the federal special education law was too lenient and allowed “special treatment for certain children,” which was resulting in the acceleration of “the decline in civility and discipline in classrooms all over America.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sessions, citing complaints from education officials, urged lawmakers in 2000 to change the law “to say that a child is not allowed to commit crimes, to disrupt classroom, to curse teachers, principals and students, and abuse them and do so with impunity.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Those remarks were made on the Senate floor while Congress was considering reauthorizing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [IDEA] 16 years ago.
