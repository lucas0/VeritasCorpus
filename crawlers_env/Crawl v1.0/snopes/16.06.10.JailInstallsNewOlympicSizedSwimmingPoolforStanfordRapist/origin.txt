  “In the end, everybody wins,” says Turner’s attorney, Mike Armstrong. “Justice is served, and our future US Olympic Swimming Team isn’t deprived of a young man who could very well be the next Michael Phelps.”

  Michael Phelps is a former Olympic swimmer who won a record 22 medals and did not rape anybody.
