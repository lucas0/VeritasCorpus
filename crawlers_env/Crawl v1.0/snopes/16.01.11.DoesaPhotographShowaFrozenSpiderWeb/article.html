  This image was cropped in an attempt to make the spider web appear as if it were of average size and was hanging between two branches of a tree. A frozen spider can still be seen at the bottom of the image, however, which provides a hint at the web’s actual (large) size:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   This year, I am attending the Helsinki Zoo International Ice Sculpture Competition, in Finland. One question I am almost always asked at events is, “How did you get into ice carving, yet there is no ice in Kenya.” I would often reply by saying that ice is just like any other medium.
  </p>
  <p>
   This year I travelled alone to the Helsinki Zoo International Ice Carving Competition. The organizers had arranged for me to join a Finnish ice carver to form a team. We are required to carve two sculptures during the four day event. First, we carved a spider web. Our next piece will depict a bee on a flower. I am the only African taking part in the event. The other competitors are from Europe, Asia and North America.
