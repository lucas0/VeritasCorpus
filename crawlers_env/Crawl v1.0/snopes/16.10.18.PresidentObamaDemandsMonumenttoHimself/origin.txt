  Obama recently has reportedly been quoted saying, “Being the first black president and all, don’t you think I deserve a monument. I mean, there’s plenty of monuments dedicated to racist white people.
 </p>
 <p>
  Obamas [sic] comments have faced criticism on the right, pointing out that anyone who calls for a monument of themselfs [sic] is consiquently [sic] undeserving of one, Though many activists praise and support this idea, and are already in the process of planning for Obama to be potentially added to Mt. Rushmore.
