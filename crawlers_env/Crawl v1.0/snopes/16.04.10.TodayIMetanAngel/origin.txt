  “I’ve done this many times, but this is the one that got out,” the man, who asked only to be identified as Briggs, [said].

 <p>
  Briggs said that initial reports of him paying $1,000 to cover some of the families’ meals are exaggerated; he really paid about $600 for everyone in the restaurant. The report about Crystal he says is true.

  And the reason he wanted to help a single mother specifically?
 </p>
 <p>
  “I grew up with a single mother of six. We were poor and homeless a lot,” Briggs told Dateline. “I watched and suffered for years as I watched her work her hands to the bone to give us a good life. She raised us to be kind and help others. Many years down the road, I was facing prison and getting in trouble. It ended up causing me to lose my family because I was a really terrible person.”

  Briggs says he eventually turned his life around. He has opened his own business and become a success.
