  Vague conspiracy theories blaming Israel began to appear within 24 hours of the attacks. Syria’s government-owned
  <em>
   Al Thawra
  </em>
  newspaper may have been the first newspaper to make the “4,000 Jews” claim. According to U.S. embassy reporting, its September 15th edition falsely claimed “four thousand Jews were absent from their work on the day of the explosions.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The 4,000 figure apparently came from an article entitled “Hundreds of Israelis missing in WTC attack” which appeared in the September 12th internet edition of the
  <i>
   Jerusalem Post
  </i>
  . It stated, “The Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem has so far received the names of 4,000 Israelis believed to have been in the areas of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon at the time of the attacks.”

 <p>
  Unknown conspiracy theorists apparently seized upon the 4,000 figure, transforming it into the false claim that 4,000 Jews did not report for work at the World Trade Center on September 11.
