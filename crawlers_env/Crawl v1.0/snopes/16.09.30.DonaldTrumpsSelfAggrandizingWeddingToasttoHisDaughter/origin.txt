   I recently obtained a transcript of Trump’s toast at the wedding reception.  It is reprinted in its entirety below.

  “Okay, everybody, listen up.  Listen up. Good to see so many nice people here and isn’t this a beautiful golf course?  I built it in record time, by the way, and no debt.  Totally debt free.  Built it with Filipino workers. Great people, the Filipinos. Hard workers and when they complain about low wages, you can’t understand them.  Last year this course was ranked Number One in the world by people who rank things.  And I love people who rank things.  They’re amazing people. How ‘bout this food?  Great stuff.  Trump Steaks.  Trump Wine.  Trump Water.  Trump Radicchio.  Trump Truffles. Trump Aspic.  Beautiful food.  And if you’re feeling a little extra peppy, that’s because the room is filled with my newest product — Trump Oxygen.  What a turnout!  Some great people here. There’s Tommy LaSorda.  What an amazing, amazing talent.  He’s definitely my main paisan.  The great entertainer Tony Danza is here.  If you get a chance, check out his one-man show at the Palace Theater in Hoboken.  Tremendous dancing and great patter.  I love patter. And over there — Pete Rose.  Just a great, great human being.  Who, by the way, should be in the Hall of Fame.  Him not being in there is a disaster.  A total disaster.  He bet on some baseball games, big deal.  So my beautiful Ivanka got married today.  And, trust me, if I wasn’t her father I’d tap that ass.
