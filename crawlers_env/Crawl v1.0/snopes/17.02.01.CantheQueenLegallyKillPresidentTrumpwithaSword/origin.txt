 <p>
  THE QUEEN has confirmed that if President Trump makes a state visit, she can kill him with a sword and nobody can touch her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Palace staff have assured the Queen that, according to English law, Trump is a subject of the Crown and can, if judged to be damaging the monarchy, be dispatched without repercussion.
 </p>
 <p>
  She said: “I haven’t made up my mind yet. I might.”
