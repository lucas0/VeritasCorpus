  In February 2016, a video purportedly showing a group of children reacting to an “incredible 7D hologram” reproduction of a surfacing whale demonstrated inside a school gymnasium was shared on social media:

  The  video was originally created by a company called “Magic Leap” in order to demonstrate the potential

   . And the goals seem similar: make a device that can be on you but “won’t take over your world,” and something that can show you what you need to see while still making eye contact with real people. Maybe these will feel more like magic glasses than magic headgear, but no image of Magic Leap’s physical hardware has yet been shown.

  As the children in the video are not wearing any sort of special headgear, we can assume that they did not actually witness a hologram whale splashing through their gym floor.  Even if they were actually seeing it, the whale would appear in the usual three dimensions, not seven.
