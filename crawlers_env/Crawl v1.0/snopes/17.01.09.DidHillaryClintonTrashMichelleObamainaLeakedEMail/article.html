  On 4 January 2017 the Facebook page “

  ” published the above-reproduced

  , claiming that Hillary Clinton had insulted First Lady Michelle Obama in a 20 October 2016 e-mail (published by WikiLeaks), as captioned by that image:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “DO WE REALLY NEED THAT MICHELLE BITCH TO BE AT THE SAME EVENTS?
  </p>
  <p>
   ITS ENOUGH TO HAVE HER DUMB ASS PIMP STINKING UP THE WORKS.
  </p>
  <p>
   THESE SHIT FOR BRAINS VOTERS NEED TO JUST VOTE ALREADY.”

   HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL TO CHELSEA CLINTON
   <br>
    OCTOBER 20, 2016
   </br>
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  This claim would have made waves if it were true, but no other news outlet reported on what would have been an easily accessed e-mail. We searched WikiLeaks first by
  <a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/?query=%22michelle+bitch%22&amp;exact_phrase=&amp;any_of=&amp;exclude_words=&amp;document_date_start=&amp;document_date_end=&amp;released_date_start=&amp;released_date_end=&amp;new_search=True&amp;publication_type%5B%5D=3&amp;order_by=most_relevant#results" target="_blank">
   keyword
  </a>
  and then for all e-mails published by WikiLeaks with a send date between 19 and 21 October 2016, but both searches similarly returned zero
  <a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/?query=&amp;exact_phrase=&amp;any_of=&amp;exclude_words=&amp;document_date_start=2016-10-19&amp;document_date_end=2016-10-21&amp;released_date_start=&amp;released_date_end=&amp;new_search=True&amp;order_by=most_relevant#results" target="_blank">

  . In short, the quote was fabricated and the e-mail in question does not exist.

 <p>
  Powdered Wig Society was not the first source to advance a fabricated Hillary Clinton quote based on a non-existent WikiLeaks document. A high-profile example of a forgery that was claimed to be a WikiLeaks publication was the widespread “

   bucket of losers

  ” comment widely (and falsely) attributed to Clinton.
