  Back in the beginning of January 2016, a very strange anti-Donald Trump ad showed up on the Austin, Texas Craigslist looking for ‘troublemakers’. Submitted by a Chicago producer with a ‘professional reputation’, the ad was taken down soon after Infowars, Investment Watch Blog and several other websites publicized the advertisement. Not surprisingly, a new ad has recently sprung up, another anti-Trump and anti-Conservatives Craigslist ad that, coincidentally or not, showed up in the Chicago Craigslist days prior to the huge violent protest that recently took down a Donald Trump rally.

  In fact, ‘mobs for hire’ are a very real phenomenon and big business in America and according to several we have visited online today, one can purchase a ‘flash mob’ for almost any occasion though this Forbes story tells us they are quite pricey. Could one purchase a mob for mass protests that might turn violent?

  We also see absolute proof here that there are paid positions for those who seek to become involved in these rebellions, quite an incentive for college students and others who are unable to obtain employment in this rapidly collapsing economy … Ever the tool of the globalists and specifically George Soros and his ‘color revolutions’ that have taken place around the world, we now have more proof that these ‘rebellions’ are being organized and designed by the very elitists themselves that the ‘rebellion’ seeks to ‘rebel against’.
