  On 18 February 2016, the web site
  <em>
   The Cutest
  </em>
  published an article about the “world’s smallest &amp; cutest rodent,” also known as the Baluchistan pygmy jerboa. While the article did describe a real (and very cute) animal, also known as the Dwarf Three-Toed Jerboa, the lead image in that particular article featured a felt doll:

  collection of “realistic felt animals” and featured in a

   gallery
  </a>
  of felt creations on the web site of a company called Heidifeathers. The photo is typically accompanied by a description of how the doll was created:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Needle felted pigmy jerboa. This felted pigmy jerboa is carefully and detailedly made even tiny fingers and fine whiskers. Using wire, soft wool and plastic eyes. This is about 2 pound coin size ( 500yen coin ), same size as actual pigmy jerboa.
  </p>

  While the above image does not show a real animal, the article on
  <em>
   The Cutest
  </em>
  accurately reports that the real Baluchistan pygmy jerboa was named the smallest rodent in the world by the Guinness Book of World Records in 2010:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Baluchistan pygmy jerboa, or the dwarf three-toed jerboa is the only species in the genus Salpingotulus. Adults average only 4.4 cm (1.7 in) in head and body length, with the tail averaging 8 cm (3.1 in). Adult females weigh 3.75 g (0.132 oz).
  </p>

  A video shows the actual pygmy jerboa, which looks quite a lot like its felted counterpart:
