  On 12 March 2016, the unreliable web site
  <em>
   American News
  </em>
  published article claiming that recently passed resolution required residents of a Texas county to pay slavery reparations to African-Americans:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Last week, a group of Dallas County commissioners decided to pass a Juneteenth resolution, in commemoration of the day that slaves in Texas earned their freedom. What many didn’t realize, however, was that the resolution was also a declaration that African Americans should receive reparations for slavery.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to the Daily Morning News, Commissioner John Wiley Price authored the resolution, which “included a long list of injustices endured by blacks, from slavery to Jim Crow to predatory lending practices.” Then, in its final paragraph, it declared that the suffering of African-Americans should be ‘satisfied with monetary and substantial reparations.’
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The article was also picked up a few days later by
  <a href="http://archive.is/CAvf3" target="_blank">
   verbatim
  </a>
  by the web site
  <em>
   Defund.com
  </em>
  , which claimed that the measure in question has passed “last week.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The only truth to either article was that, as noted in an item

  </em>
  back in June 2014, Dallas County has passed a
  <strong>
   non-binding
  </strong>
  “Juneteenth Resolution” (largely voted for by country commissioners who hadn’t bothered reading it first) that did not result in any tax money changing hands or the mandatory payment of reparations:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The issue arose in a resolution written by John Wiley Price, the county’s only black commissioner. Described only as a “Juneteenth Resolution,” it was approved unanimously.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other commissioners admitted after their meeting that they hadn’t read the document before voting for it.
  </p>
  <p>
   Commissioner Mike Cantrell, the court’s lone Republican, later changed his vote to an abstention.
  </p>
  <p>
   “The reason why I didn’t abstain this morning is that I had not received a copy of the resolution,” he said.
  </p>
  <p>
   None of the other commissioners changed their votes, meaning the resolution remains the county’s official position.It is, however, a nonbinding resolution, and no tax money will change hands as a result of its passage.
