  There is no denying that African Americans have suffered unduly at the hands of the government. The Social Security number theory’s got that sort of element of the government wanting to track Black people.  It’s a theory typical of a suspicion or mistrust of the government that also exists in the non-Black community. Segments of the white community initially resisted implementation of the Social Security card system because they didn’t like the idea of Big Brother government nationally numbering people”
