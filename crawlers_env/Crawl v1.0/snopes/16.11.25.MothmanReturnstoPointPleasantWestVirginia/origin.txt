  During the next three days at least eight persons reported various similar creatures. On Nov. 18, two volunteer firemen, Capt. Paul Yoder and Benjamin Enochs, said they saw what definitely was a very large bird with large red eyes.

  Dr. Robert L. Smith, associated professor of wildlife biology at WVU [West Virginia University], said the descriptions all fitted the sandhill crane, the second largest American crane, which stands almost as high as a man and has a wing span of more than seven feet.

  He said the “red eyes” could be the large circles of bare reddish flesh around the crane’s eyes. Smith said the bird apparently had wandered out of its normal migration route.
