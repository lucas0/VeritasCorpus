 <p>
  A lion and tiger and bear; oh my!
 </p>
 <p>
  As cubs a lion, a tiger, and a bear had been owned by a drug dealer who did not properly care for them. The bear’s harness grew into his skin because the owner did not alter it as the animal grew. They had been abused and neglected early in life, but were finally rescued. The bear’s harness was surgically removed.
 </p>
 <p>
  After they had been taken in by an animal sanctuary in Georgia, the staff tried to separate them due to obvious concerns that the three large predators would fight. During the trial of separation, the animals were uncooperative and behaved poorly. Once reunited, the three calmed down and were well behaved.
 </p>
 <p>
  Twelve years later, the three friends spend their days playing, cuddling, and eating together. There are no plans to separate these lifelong friends.
