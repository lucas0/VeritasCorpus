 <p>
  Keith Richards
  <strong>
   Found Not Dead
  </strong>
  in San Francisco Hotel
 </p>
 <p>
  “With a very heavy heart, I am sad to announce that sometime early this morning, Rolling Stones guitarist,
  <strong>
   Keith Richards was found still alive
  </strong>
  .” said  Ms. D’lune choking back tears, “He was found in his suite, sitting in a chair, watching Jamie Oliver reruns on the tele. Emergency personnel were summoned and exhaustive attempts were made to revive him, but since
  <strong>
   Mr. Richards was not dead
  </strong>
  , that was deemed unnecessary.”
