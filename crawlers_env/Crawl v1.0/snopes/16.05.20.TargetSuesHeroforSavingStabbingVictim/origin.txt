  Michael Turner saved a 16-year-old girl from being stabbed to death, and Target wants him to apologize for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 2013, Michael Turner saved the life of a 16-year-old girl who had been viciously attacked and stabbed in a Target store in Pennsylvania. And instead of thanking him for protecting its customers and preventing them from being murdered, Target is now suing him for his heroism and alleging he acted irresponsibly.
