  that Beaumont, Texas, morgue worker Henri Paul Johnson was inadvertently incinerated by a coworker as he napped on the job:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   An employee of the Jefferson County morgue died this morning, after being accidentally cremated by one of his coworkers.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to the Beaumont Police Department, 48-year old Henri Paul Johnson decided to take a nap one a stretcher after working for sixteen hours straight.
  </p>
  <p>
   While he was sleeping, another employee mistook him for the corpse of a 52-year old car accident victim and carried him to the crematory.
  </p>
  <p>
   Before anyone could notice the mistake, he had already been exposed to temperatures ranging between 1400 to 1800 degrees Fahrenheit and reduced to ashes.
  </p>

  Also depicted in the article was Jenna Davis, a coworker who purportedly heard Johnson’s death screams:

   Jenna Davis, one of Henri Johnson’s coworkers, says she heard him scream for about 15 seconds after the crematory was activated.
  </p>
  <p>
   “At first, we didn’t understand where the sound was coming from. When we realised what was happening, it was too late. We shut down the heating system, but he was already dead.”
