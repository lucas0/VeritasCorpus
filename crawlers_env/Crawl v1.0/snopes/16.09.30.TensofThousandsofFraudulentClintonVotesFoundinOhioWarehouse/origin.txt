  <em>
   Election officials in Franklin County, Ohio are reportedly stumped over what one maintenance worker found in a dilapidated downtown Columbus warehouse earlier this week.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  According to sources, Randall Prince, a Columbus-area electrical worker, was doing a routine check of his companies wiring and electrical systems when he stumbled across approximately one dozen black, sealed ballot boxes filled with thousands of Franklin County votes for Hillary Clinton and other Democrat candidates.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clinton campaignâ€™s likely goal was to slip the fake ballot boxes in with the real ballot boxes when they went to official election judges on November 8th.
