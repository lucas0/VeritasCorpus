  On 30 September 2016, the
  <em>
   Christian Times Newspaper
  </em>
  (CTN) web site
  <a href="http://archive.is/5lfHH" target="_blank">
   published
  </a>
  an article reporting that “tens of thousands” of pre-marked ballots cast for Hillary Clinton and other Democratic candidates had been discovered stored in an Ohio warehouse:

    Election officials in Franklin County, Ohio are reportedly stumped over what one maintenance worker found in a dilapidated downtown Columbus warehouse earlier this week.

  </p>
  <p>
   According to sources, Randall Prince, a Columbus-area electrical worker, was doing a routine check of his companies wiring and electrical systems when he stumbled across approximately one dozen black, sealed ballot boxes filled with thousands of Franklin County votes for Hillary Clinton and other Democrat candidates.

  <p>
   Clinton campaign’s likely goal was to slip the fake ballot boxes in with the real ballot boxes when they went to official election judges on November 8th.

  There is no truth to the above-quoted story.

  ‘s report described the above-displayed photograph as showing “Randall Prince” with his discovery of pre-marked Clinton ballots, but this

   picture

  was actually taken in 2015 in Birmingham, England, and simply captures a man unloading a truck of ballot boxes at a polling station. It appears that CTN altered the photograph (removing “Ballot Box” from some of the boxes and reversing the image) in an apparent attempt to make it difficult to find the original picture:

  Although CTN presents itself as a legitimate publication (by imitating the name of the genuine
  <em>
   Christian Times
  </em>
  newspaper), the web site has invented and promoted numerous conspiracy theories, including false stories reporting that Donald Trump was
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/donald-trump-primary-ballots/" target="_blank">
   removed
  </a>
  from primary ballots, that Clinton said “
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-blames-racism-for-cincinnati-gorillas-death/" target="_blank">
   Harambe
  </a>
  ” was a victim of racism,  that an African-American Trump supporter was
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/black-trump-supporter-shot/" target="_blank">
   killed
  </a>
  in Chicago, and that the 4th of July had been
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/fireworks-cancelled/" target="_blank">
   cancelled
  </a>
  due to fears of terrorism.
