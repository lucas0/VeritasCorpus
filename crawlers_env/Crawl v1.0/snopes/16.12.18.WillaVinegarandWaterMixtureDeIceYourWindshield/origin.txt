  Q: I keep my car outdoors at night during the winter. I use one of those cardboards on the windshield, but it still ices and frosts up.  What can I do to stop this?

 <p>
  A: Dip a sponge or cloth into a solution of three parts of either white or yellow vinegar to one part of water. The windshield should stay ice-free. Repeat occasionally.
