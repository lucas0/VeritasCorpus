  “Doug, do you feel like Jackie Robinson?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Doug, would you have been able to handle all of this, especially the black thing, if you had made the Super Bowl a few years back, say, when you were 25?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Doug, has there been much progress in this country since 1970, when the schools you grew up in were finally integrated?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Doug, do you feel because of the black quarterback issue, that the whole country is looking at you and saying, ‘Well, what are you going to do?'”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Doug, would it be easier if you were the second black quarterback to play in the Super Bowl?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Doug, why haven’t you used being the first black quarterback as a personal forum for yourself?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Doug, will America be pulling for the Redskins, or rooting against them because of you?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Doug, what were your reactions to what Jimmy the Greek said?”
 </p>
 <p>
  [Note: Two weeks earlier, CBS commentator Jimmy the Greek had been fired for remarking that blacks were better at sports because of slave plantation breeding techniques: “During the slave period, the slave owner would breed his big black with his big woman so that he would have a big black kid — that’s where it all started.”]
 </p>
 <p>
  “Doug, have you been contacted by the Rev. Jesse Jackson or any other black civil rights leaders?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Doug, are you upset about all the questions about your being the first black quarterback in the Super Bowl?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Actually, the craziest question of all could have been put to Mark May, a Redskins offensive lineman, who was asked, “How does it feel to block for the first black quarterback in the Super Bowl?” And that was followed closely by a newspaper person from Colorado asking me, “How does it feel to be a black writer covering the first black quarterback in the Super Bowl?”
