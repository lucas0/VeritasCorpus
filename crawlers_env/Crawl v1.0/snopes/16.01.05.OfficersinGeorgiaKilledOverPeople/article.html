  On 24 December 2015, the above-reproduced text was published to the Facebook group “MCM [Movie Comic Media] EXPO GROUP.” It held that two police officers from Georgia were responsible for a multitude of crimes, including the deaths of more than 250 civilians.

  While the post, and its accompanying image, were recognizable to many social media users in the United States as a description of the zombie-themed television and graphic novel series
  <em>
   The Walking Dead
  </em>
  , its appearance in a European group led to some confusion among users unfamiliar with the show. The post was shared tens of thousands of times, and comments included the following:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Demented and evil America. Where murderers in the police and other forces are decorated. And celebrated by US government and politicians.

  As a matter of fact, Andrew Lincoln, the British actor who plays one of main characters in
  <em>
   The Walking Dead
  </em>
  , did indeed have a

  While the 24 December 2015 iteration was the most prolific, it wasn’t the first. On 19 December 2015, a slightly different version appeared:

  As predicted by a prescient commenter on that post, we began receiving steady e-mails about the claims shortly after the 24 December 2015 iteration appeared. While most appeared to have shared the post as a joke, many were genuinely concerned about the two murderous cops and their increasing body count in a fictional, post-apocalyptic Georgia.
