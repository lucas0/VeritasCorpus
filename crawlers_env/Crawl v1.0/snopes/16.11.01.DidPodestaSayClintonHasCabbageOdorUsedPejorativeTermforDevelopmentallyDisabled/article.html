  On 31 October 2016, what appeared to be a screenshot of an e-mail purportedly sent by John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, to an unidentified individual was

   circulated

  online, describing the candidate in several unflattering ways:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   People tell me that Hillary is acting ‘like a retard’ since her head injury. Frankly, considering her normal behavior, I’m surprised anyone noticed! (this is a joke!) Have someone talk to her doctor and see if there’s anything he can give her.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also, I’ve noticed she’s had an “odor” lately. It reminds me of a combination of boiled cabbage, urine, and farts. I’m guessing it’s either connected to her fall or simply the fact that she rarely bathes. Outside of encouraging her to take a shower once in a while, I don’t know what to do about this. — any suggestions would be appreciated.

  The image appeared during the release of a multi-part WikiLeaks series called “The Podesta Emails” (gleaned from hacked e-mails sent to and from Podesta’s account), and in the flood of documents dumped by WikiLeaks throughout October 2016 it was often mistaken for a legitimate communication.  However, it was pretty simple to discern via WikiLeaks searchable archive that no such offensive e-mail

   John Podesta confirms for us that Hillary Clinton "rarely bathes," and emits an "odor" that smells like "boiled cabbage, urine, and farts."

  This claim was far from the first opportunistic WikiLeaks fabrication to go viral on social media. An earlier fabricated WikiLeaks item falsely suggested Clinton had described a large swath of Democrats as “a
