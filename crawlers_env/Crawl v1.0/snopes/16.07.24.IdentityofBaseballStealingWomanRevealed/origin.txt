<blockquote>
 <p>
  During a recent game between the Astros and Diamondbacks at Minute Maid Park, an unknown woman was caught on camera taking a ball from a sweet little girl.
 </p>
 <p>
  The video is only 20 seconds, but it shows a ball being tossed by a player to a little girl and some awful lady ripping it out of the little girlâ€™s hands. She then high-fives the person she was with, while the little girl runs away heartbroken.
 </p>
 <p>
  The absolute worst part of the video is near the end when the woman turns away from the cluster of children and to her friends to show off her new possession. Lady, baseballs are cheap, and the Astros are terrible. That ball is nearly worthless, and you look like a jerk.
