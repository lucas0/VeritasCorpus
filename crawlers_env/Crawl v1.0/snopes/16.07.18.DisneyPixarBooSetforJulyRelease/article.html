  On 18 July 2016 a Facebook user published the above-reproduced status update, suggesting that Disney/Pixar was set to release a follow up to the wildly popular
  <em>
   Monsters, Inc.
  </em>
  titled
  <em>
   Boo
  </em>
  (and presumably starring the character “Boo” from the original).
 </p>
 <p>
  Within five hours, the post was shared more than 150,000 times by apparent Boo and
  <em>
   Monsters, Inc.
  </em>
  fans, many of whom believed the poster depicted confirmed a July 2020 release date for the film. However, the image was watermarked with the name of an Instagram account, and the image itself uploaded one day prior:

     ?TAG SOMEONE WHO WOULD WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE ? – Hi everyone, my name is Nico. I’m a huge Disney fan, and I decided to make a Disney account, where I would post concept art and ideas for upcoming Disney movies. Please tell your friends about my page to help my page grow! ?? – CONCEPT: Disney/Pixar, “BOO.” This movie would be the sequel to Disney Pixar’s “Monsters Inc.” Boo is all grown up, and she decides to revisit her past. She hasn’t seen Mike and Sully for years. She travels far and overrides fears and obstacles just to find Mike and Sully again. Join “Boo” in her journey to find the monsters that were once in her closet. EDIT: YES THIS IS ANNA FROM FROZEN! I edited her hair, eyes, clothes, and face. I changed her nose to make it look a bit more like boo! I’m so happy with how popular this edit became. ?? #MonstersInc #monstersinc2 #Boo #Disney #Pixar #monstersuniversity

  The fan artist behind the image explained that the work was conceptual in nature and was in no way related to an upcoming Disney release:

  As such,
  <em>
   Boo

  was simply the creation of one talented fan and not a pending Pixar or Disney release. The unintentional crossover was one of several fan creations that led folks on social media to inaccurately infer a long-awaited sequel was finally in the works. A fake poster for
