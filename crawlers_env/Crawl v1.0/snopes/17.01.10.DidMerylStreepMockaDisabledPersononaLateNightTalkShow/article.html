  Several rumors aimed at discrediting Meryl Streep were circulated in January 2017 shortly after the actress delivered a controversial speech at the Golden Globes in which she criticized President-elect Donald Trump for (among other things) reportedly

   mocking

  a disabled reporter. For example, a video was circulated purportedly showing the actress applauding for Roman Polanski (who fled the U.S. to avoid sexual assault charges) at the 2003 Academy Awards (

  The above-displayed image does depict a real moment from a talk show on which Streep appeared, but it had little to do with the mentally challenged.

   <strong>
    Streep
   </strong>
   : I did feel pretty safe except on the last day of shooting (director Sydney Pollack) wanted the lions to … they imported all of the lions from California.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Conan
   </strong>
   : You get a more laid back lions that way.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Streep
   </strong>
   : You do. They were kind of relaxed. And they were not charging me in the right way. There’s a scene inside of a boma, which is an enclosure for cattle made of thorns and stuff. And the cattle were on one side and then there was me with my whip and this little was just sitting there … because she was chained.
  </p>
  <p>
   So I’d go (whip sound) and she was supposed to charge me with the camera covering the side so it doesn’t show her leash. And she just wouldn’t do it. So on the last take Sydney told them to take the leash off. Because it was a wrap the next day and if they got the shot. They got the shot.
  </p>
  <p>
   Act three. (Whip sound). And the lion went (Roar Sound) and I went (scared gesture.)
  </p>
  <p>
   And Sydney says it didn’t happen. But it did happen.

  In short, the animated image supposedly showing Meryl Streep mocking a disabled person actually captures a portion Streep’s appearance on
  <em>
   The Tonight Show with Conan O’Brien
  </em>
  in which she told (and partially acted out) a story about being scared by a lion on the set of
  <em>
   Out of Africa
  </em>
  .
