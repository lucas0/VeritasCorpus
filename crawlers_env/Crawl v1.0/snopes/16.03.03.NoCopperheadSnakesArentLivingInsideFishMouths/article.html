     Fellow Anglers beware. Several snake bites this season have came from baby copperheads found alive inside of feeding fish. With the top water bite happening now the snakes get more oxygen to prolong there life inside the fish while the fish continues to feed. Makes the want to have bass thumb a little less desirable. Lol

  The above-displayed photo, however, does not show a copperhead. This particular has been circulating since at least 2009, when it was shared in a gallery on the web site

   Okay, we’re half completely grossed out and half fascinated by Ricky Stephens photos of a largemouth bass he caught that swallowed—or rather half-swallowed—a garter snake.

  The warning displayed in the meme originated on Facebook and not with an official wildlife organization, and was made up by a Facebook user in order to give an interesting photo a viral lift:
