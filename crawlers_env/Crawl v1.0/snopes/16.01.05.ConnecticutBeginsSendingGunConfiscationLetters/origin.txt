 <p>
  Fox News has finally reported that Connecticut has sent out gun confiscation letters.
 </p>
 <p>
  The letters tell gun owners of now-illegal assault weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines to relinquish the arms to the police or make them permanently inoperable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds of thousands of residents have yet to comply with the new law, which they were required to do by Jan. 1st of this year â€“ turning them all into felons overnight.
