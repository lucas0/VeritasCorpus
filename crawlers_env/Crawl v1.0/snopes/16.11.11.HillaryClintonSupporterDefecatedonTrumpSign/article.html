  On 11 November 2016, a video purporting to show a Hillary Clinton supporter defecating on a Donald Trump sign was widely circulated on social media:

   This image is real, inasmuch that it shows someone defecating in public and then wiping it on a sign, but it has nothing to do with Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, or the 2016 presidential election. It is a screenshot from a video that dates back to at least 2012, and was taken in the

    Zocaló
   </a>
   (Mexico City’s famous main square, and an extremely popular place for both tourists and demonstrations). The description on the original video labeled the act as a political performance (the title is “¡PARA CAMBIAR AL PRI HAY QUE CAGAR!”, which loosely translates to “You have to take a shit on the PRI to change it.”)

  PRI stands for “Partido Revolucionario Institucional,” or “Institutional Revolutionary Party.” It is a major political party in Mexico, and has been its most powerful for decades.  The PRI held power without interruption in Mexico from 1929 — just after president-elect

   Álvaro Obregón
  </a>
  was assassinated — to 2000, when other

   parties
  </a>
  ascended to break its uninterrupted rule in an election that made history, promising a future ahead free of authoritarian and hugely

   repressive
  </a>
  regimes.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the promise of a PRI-free future for Mexico was broken in 2012, when its candidate Enrique Peña Nieto was elected president (as stories surfaced of PRI

  and rumors
  <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Enrique-Pena-Nieto" target="_blank">
   swirled
  </a>
  that he and his party had hijacked the election).
 </p>
 <p>
  As in Mexico in 2012, thousands of people took to the streets in the United States after Trump’s election on 8 November 2016 to stage protests. While these protests are

  and while there have been reports of

   violence

  , fake

  and baseless claims of “

   paid protesters

  ” have also circulated.

  However, this particular image does not come from the United States but Mexico, and first appeared not in 2016, but in 2012.
