 <p>
  A bear on a motorcycle took an evening tour before visiting the circus. A representative of the company explained to 29.ru that Tim rides in every city and that it is one of his favorite activities.

 <p>
  When his motorcycle overheated in Syktyvkar, it was necessary to find a new method. We decided to transport him into a jeep, but he flatly refused.

  The bear, named Tim, was disabled from birth. He is completely blind in one eye and would not have survived in the natural environment. The circus was very pleased that he joined the company. He is 22, almost at the age of retirement.
