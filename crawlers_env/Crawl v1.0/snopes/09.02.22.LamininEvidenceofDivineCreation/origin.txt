<blockquote>
 <p>
  Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:
 </p>
 <p>
  Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:
 </p>
 <p>
  In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:
 </p>
 <p>
  Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:
 </p>
 <p>
  For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:
 </p>
 <p>
  And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
 </p>
 <p>
  And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.
 </p>
 <p>
  For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;
 </p>
 <p>
  And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.
 </p>
