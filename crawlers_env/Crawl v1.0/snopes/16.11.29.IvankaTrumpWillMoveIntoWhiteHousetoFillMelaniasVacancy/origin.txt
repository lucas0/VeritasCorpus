  President-Elect Donald J. Trump announced this week that incoming First Lady Melania Trump and his son Barron would not be moving into the White House when he is sworn-in next January. Today he announced that his daughter Ivanka would be “taking on some of Melania’s key positions” and one of them would include moving into the White House to “fill Melania’s vacancy.”

  “It’s a really natural fit, first of all,” Trump explained to the press pool covering him, “and second of all, it’s not like it’s a downgrade in hotness at all. Look at my daughter. Isn’t she friggin’ gorgeous? I think she is. I think she’s so gorgeous that sometimes I just can’t help myself and I, you know, want to Access Hollywood her, if you know what I mean? Of course you do. Everyone knows what I mean because I have this great brain here.”
