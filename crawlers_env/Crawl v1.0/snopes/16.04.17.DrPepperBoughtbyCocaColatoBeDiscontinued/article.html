  In April 2016, many social media users encountered an image on Facebook headlined “An American Classic Says Goodbye!” which announced that the rights to the popular Dr Pepper soft drink had been bought up by Coca-Cola, who would be imminently discontinuing production of their new acquisition:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   After 131 years of quenching American’s [sic] thirst, Dr. Pepper announces it will halt production in the Summer of 2016. Though sales have always remained consistent, Dr Pepper says it can no longer compete with other soda producers using cheaper ingredients. Rights to the recipe have been sold to Coca-Cola Corp who says they will stop production sometime during the Summer of 2016. Dr Pepper you will be truly missed by millions of Americans!
