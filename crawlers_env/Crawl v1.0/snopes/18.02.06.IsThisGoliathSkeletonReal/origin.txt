  Archaeologist Dr. Richard Martin says: “We found the skull in the Valley of Elah, in the foothills of the Judean Mountains, where David’s battle with Goliath took place. The skull is huge and clearly belongs to a man of enormous stature.”

  Tests show that the skull is between 2 900 and 3 000 years old – about the right time for the biblical battle.

 <p>
  Dr. Martin says: “This is the archaeological find of the year.”
