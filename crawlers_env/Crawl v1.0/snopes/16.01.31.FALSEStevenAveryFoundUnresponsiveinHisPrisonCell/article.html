  On 30 January 2016,
  <em>
   United Media Publishing
  </em>
  posted an article reporting that Steven Avery, who was released after serving 18 years in prison for a wrongful sexual assault conviction (but was subsequently re-convicted on murder charges), and whose case was recently the focus of the Netflix  documentary
  <em>
   Making a Murderer
  </em>
  , had been found unresponsive in his prison cell:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   According to Waupun Correctional Facility representatives, Avery was found unresponsive in his prison cell at approximately 4:30 AM during his cell block’s daily wake-up call. Correctional officers attempted to communicate with Avery, however according to one of the on-scene officers, “He (Avery) just wouldn’t respond, it was pretty obvious to all that were on-scene that the lights were off and nobody was home”.
  </p>
  <p>
   The news is disheartening to Avery’s thousands of new-found supporters on the tail of the recent 10 episode Netflix documentary series Making a Murderer. Many supporters that are hopeful Avery would live to see the outside of the Waupun Correctional Facility have taken to social media with an out-pour of support for the Avery family.
