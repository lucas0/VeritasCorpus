  Beginning in 1967 the focus of the legend shifted dramatically from poison to razors and sharp objects hidden in apples. The emergence of the razor blade motif remains to be studied, but it apparently spread rapidly in several areas of the eastern seaboard and Canada:
  <i>
   The New York Times
  </i>
  reported thirteen cases from isolated communities in
  <nobr>
   New Jersey
  </nobr>
  and noted “several” others in Ottawa and Toronto. Outrage was so strong in
  <nobr>
   New Jersey
  </nobr>
  that the state legislature passed a law shortly before
  <nobr>
   Halloween 1968
  </nobr>
  mandating prison terms for those caught boobytrapping apples. This did not forestall the discovery of thirteen more apples with razor blades that year in five
  <nobr>
   New Jersey
  </nobr>
  counties.

 <p>
  In many cases,
  <i>
   The New York Times
  </i>
  story noted that “children were cut,” but the more detailed accounts include suspicious details. In one case a boy came to his parents with an apple containing a razor blade. He had bit into an apple, he said, but not quite deeply enough to contact the blade. In another, the child said he found the blade while cutting out a rotten spot; in a third case, the razor was found when a child turned an apple over to his father for peeling. In all these detailed cases, the child was not injured, and because he was the immediate source of the apple, it seems possible that he was also the source of the blade. As Best and Horiuchi (authors of the
  <i>
   Razor Blade
  </i>
  ) note, more than
  <nobr>
   75 percent
  </nobr>
  of reported cases involved no injury, and detailed followups in 1972 and 1982 concluded that virtually all the reports were hoaxes concocted by the children or parents. Thus this legend type seems to have grown out of a tradition of ostensive hoaxes relying on an understood oral tradition, rather than on any core of authenticated incidents.
