  On 27 May 2016, President Obama became the first sitting president to visit Hiroshima, Japan since the end of World War II. While some media outlets painted the historic visit as another stop on Obama’s “

  ,” the president did not actually apologize.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, social media users were outraged at the President’s supposed apology:

  On 26 May 2016, the
  <em>
   New York Post
  </em>
  published an
  <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/05/26/obamas-shameful-apology-tour-lands-in-hiroshima/" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  criticizing the president for his “shameful” apology tour. While the author assumed that Obama would apologize (despite the White House saying that an apology would not be forthcoming), the article came out a day before Obama’s speech and therefore did not serve as evidence:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   An American president’s highest moral, constitutional and political duty is protecting his fellow citizens from foreign threats. Presidents should adhere to our values and the Constitution, and not treat America’s enemies as morally equivalent to us.
  </p>
  <p>
   If they do, they need not apologize to anyone.
  </p>
  <p>
   The White House says that President Obama won’t apologize as he visits Hiroshima Friday. But who believes his press flacks?
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The president did make an apology while he was in Japan, but it wasn’t for the atomic bomb. On 25 May 2016, the President offered his “deepest regrets” for the death of a Japanese woman who reportedly had been

   murdered

  by a former U.S. Marine:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “The U.S. will continue to cooperate fully” and will continue to ensure “justice is done under the Japanese legal system,” Obama said.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  While critics of President Obama preemptively condemned him for apologizing for the United States’ 1945

  of his remarks did he offer an apology:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Seventy-one years ago, on a bright cloudless morning, death fell from the sky and the world was changed. A flash of light and a wall of fire destroyed a city and demonstrated that mankind possessed the means to destroy itself.
  </p>
  <p>
   Why do we come to this place, to Hiroshima? We come to ponder a terrible force unleashed in a not-so-distant past. We come to mourn the dead, including over 100,000 Japanese men, women and children, thousands of Koreans, a dozen Americans held prisoner.
  </p>
  <p>
   Their souls speak to us. They ask us to look inward, to take stock of who we are and what we might become.
