  On 21 February 2016, the entertainment web site
  <em>
   Huzlers
  </em>
  published a fake news article claiming that Daniel Lara, star of the popular “Damn Daniel” Vine videos, was mugged for his signature white Vans shoes:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   After the “Damn Daniel” video of a California teenager recording his friend “Daniel” and saying the phrase “Damn Daniel” multiple times as he walks around the school looking cool and wearing his white vans went extremely viral on the Internet, it is being reported that “Daniel”, real name Daniel Lara, is being hospitalized in critical condition after he was severely beaten and robbed for his white vans just outside his home in California Saturday night, just only a few days after the “Damn Daniel” video went viral.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The above-quoted story refers to a viral Vine video in which an off-screen voice calls out “Damn Daniel” in praise of a teenager’s shoes:

  In addition to publishing a fictitious story about “Damn Daniel’s” mugging,
  <em>
   Huzlers
  </em>
  also created an eBay listing for Daniel’s shoes. While the eBay listing is real (the current bid is at $50,300), the sale was created by “Huzlers4” and has no ties to the real “Damn Daniel”.  In fact, the
  <em>
   Huzlers
  </em>
  listing is one of many fake eBay posts for shoes worn by “Damn Daniel”:
