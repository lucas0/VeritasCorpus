  After the “Damn Daniel” video of a California teenager recording his friend “Daniel” and saying the phrase “Damn Daniel” multiple times as he walks around the school looking cool and wearing his white vans went extremely viral on the Internet, it is being reported that “Daniel”, real name Daniel Lara, is being hospitalized in critical condition after he was severely beaten and robbed for his white vans just outside his home in California Saturday night, just only a few days after the “Damn Daniel” video went viral.
