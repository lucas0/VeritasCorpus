  The 5 November 2017 mass shooting at
  <a href="https://www.snopes.com/2017/11/05/mass-shooting-south-texas-church/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   Sutherland Springs
  </a>
  First Baptist Church in Texas led to the spread of a number of
  <a href="https://www.snopes.com/sutherland-springs-shooting-rumors-hoaxes-and-conspiracy-theories/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   rumors and hoaxes
  </a>
  , among the latter a
  <a href="https://archive.is/5YXoX" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   claim
  </a>
  that the perpetrator was an atheist and was on the payroll of the Democratic National Committee (DNC):
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   FBI and Texas State Police are both confirming that Raymond Peter Littleberry, the man accused of shooting up a Texas church, was an avid atheist on the payroll of the Democrat National Committee. LLOD correspondent Art Tubolls is on the scene:
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    “People are saying he wasn’t looking for anything other than to ‘demonstrate that it it science, not some made-up God that decides if you live or die.’ He was apparently trying to maske [sic] the point that bullets are more powerful than prayer.”
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   Littleberry was known in the small Texas town just outside of Arlington as a liberal island in the middle of a conservative sea. He was often the only protester to show up to support BLM after some criminal is gunned down by police. Last year he held a gay pride parade through town to support his homosexual brothers and sisters and he was the only one there.
  </p>
  <p>
   Littleberry’s frustration grew and he built an arsenal. A law-abiding citizen, nothing kept him from stockpiling.

 <p>
  An initial red flag in this report was mention of someone named “Raymond Peter Littleberry” having been identified as the shooter, even though police
  <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-church-shooting-devin-patrick-kelley-first-baptist-church-sutherland-springs-live-updates/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   affirmed
  </a>
  the assailant was named Devin Patrick Kelley.
 </p>
 <p>
  But an even bigger indicator that this tale was completely fabricated was that it originated with the web site
  <a href="https://www.snopes.com/tag/freedum-junkshun/" target="fj">
   Freedum Junkshun
  </a>
  , a fake news site whose disclaimer notes that the site’s content is “pure satirical fiction”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   We believe that there is nothing more precious than the mind of an aging conservative. Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate. Reality is often in the eye of the beholder. You won’t find any of it here.
