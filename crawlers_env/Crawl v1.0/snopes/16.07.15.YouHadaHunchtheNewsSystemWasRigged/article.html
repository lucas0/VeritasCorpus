   Conservatives have suggested that these relationships may play a role in how the media cover Obama, specifically in their supposedly timid approach to reporting on the White House’s handling of the terrorist attacks last year on American facilities in Benghazi, Libya.

The critics, they say, can’t point to any direct evidence that such relationships have affected the amount or tone of their news coverage.
