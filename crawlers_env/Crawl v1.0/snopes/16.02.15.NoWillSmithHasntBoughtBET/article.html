  On 29 January 2016, the web site
  <em>
   NahaDaily
  </em>
  published an article reporting that Will and Jada Pinkett Smith had purchased the television channel
  <a href="http://www.bet.com/" target="_blank">
   BET
  </a>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Will and Jada purchased B.E.T. along with the help of an investment group Thursday afternoon for $600 million in cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   “What we’re going to do is cancel everything on B.E.T. and replace it with things that black people actually like. It’s not rocket science.” -Will.

  <em>
   NahaDaily

  is a fake news web site that does not publish any factual articles. A disclaimer on the bottom of the web site states: “NegrosAgainstHairlineAbuse is Satire. Humor. Not Real. :-)”

  In addition to the dubious source for this story, BET has not made any recent announcements about a change of ownership. The channel was started by Robert L. Johnson in 1980, and is owned and operated by Black Entertainment Television, LLC (a subsidiary of
