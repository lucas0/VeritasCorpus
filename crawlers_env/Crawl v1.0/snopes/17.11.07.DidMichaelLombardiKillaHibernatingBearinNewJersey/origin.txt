  More than 500 bears have been killed in this year’s annual hunt but still the rate is below what state biologists say is needed to keep the black bear population stable — and to stop bears from expanding their range throughout the state.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reintroduced in 2010, the aim of the annual bear hunt, according to the Department of Environmental Protection, is to keep the black bear population in check by balancing out the number of cubs born every year, known as “recruitment.” Animal-rights activists and environmental groups have regularly protested the hunt, saying killing the animals is neither humane nor an effective long-term solution.

  “We have a very productive bear population that on average has a litter of two or three cubs (each year), but sometimes as many as four or five,” said DEP spokesman Larry Hajna. “More bears are being born than are being lost.”‘
 </p>
 <p>
  The goal, Hajna said, is to cull between 20 to 30 percent of the 133 bears tagged by the Division of Fish and Wildlife — a range of between 26 to 40 tagged bears. After the first week of the hunt fell short of that figure despite a greater harvest than the past two years, the season was extended by four days.
