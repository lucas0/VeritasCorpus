 <p>
  There was drama today in Kitwe at mukuba mall when a strange image that look like a human appeared in the clouds.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to eye witnesses say the strange image that looked like a human was in the sky for over 30 minutes while looking down at the mall.
 </p>
 <p>
  This forced people who were shopping scampering in different directions thinking that God had finally come.
 </p>
 <p>
  “we were shocked to see images that looked like a human in the clouds for close to 30 minutes, others started worshiping but others ran away. It was so strange” said an eye witness.
