 <p>
  Please carry water with you at all times.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s summer in London, which means the tube smells like someone left a ham behind a radiator for 16 years.
 </p>
 <p>
  We know it’s warm, everyone knows it’s warm, carry some water so you don’t fucking pass out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please wear deodorant, you might not be able to smell yourself but the rest of us can and you smell dreadful.
