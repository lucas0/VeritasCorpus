  Americans were pleased, gratified, and fascinated when newspapers in other countries ran strongly pro-American articles in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, as indicated by the resurgence of interest in Canadian

  ‘s 28-year-old radio broadcast and the tremendous amount of attention paid to the Romanian newspaper editorial quoted above.  Since the editorial as circulated via
  <nobr>
   e-mail
  </nobr>
  was undated, untitled, and unsigned; contained no publication information whatsoever; and was a translation of an article not originally printed in English, tracking it to its source was not an easy task back in October of 2001.
 </p>
 <p>
  This editorial was written by Mr. Cornel Nistorescu, managing editor of the Romanian newspaper
  <em>
   Evenimentul Zilei
  </em>
  , in which his piece was

   published
  </a>
  under the title “Cîntarea Americii” (translated into English as “Ode to America”) on
  <nobr>
   24 September
  </nobr>
  2001.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Associated Press reported of Mr. Nistorescu that:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Nistorescu, managing director of the daily newspaper Evenimentul Zilei — News of the Day — published his editorial Sept 24, two days after watching a celebrity telethon in New York for victims of the
   <nobr>
    attacks.
   </nobr>
  </p>
  <p>
   Like his other columns, “Ode to America” was meant for domestic consumption. No one knows
   <nobr>
    when — or
   </nobr>
   <nobr>
    how — the
   </nobr>
   article first reached the other side of the Atlantic. But Nistorescu figures it began when someone pulled it off the English-language version of his daily’s Web page and sent it to a friend.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since then, thousands of Americans at home and expats around the world have e-mailed it to friends, saying it captured their nation’s spirit. It has been read out to U.S. soldiers and on radio talk shows and posted on U.S. Web sites.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nistorescu says he had no idea his “Ode to America” would resonate so far
   <nobr>
    away.
   </nobr>
  </p>
  <p>
   Nistorescu remains surprised and touched by the success of the piece, one of thousands he has penned in a more than 20-year career.
  </p>
  <p>
   “It is all about the American spirit and how freedom cannot be crushed,” he says.
