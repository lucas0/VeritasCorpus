  On 14 December 2016, a video purportedly showing a driverless Uber running a red light in San Francisco appeared and was quickly circulated on social media:

   The video was published on the same day that Uber
   <a href="https://newsroom.uber.com/san-francisco-your-self-driving-uber-is-arriving-now/" target="_blank">
    launched
   </a>
   its driverless fleet in San Francisco:
  </br>
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Starting today, riders who request an uberX in San Francisco will be matched with a Self-Driving Uber if one is available. Expanding our self-driving pilot allows us to continue to improve our technology through real-world operations. With its challenging roads and often varied weather, Pittsburgh provided a wide array of experiences. San Francisco comes with its own nuances including more bikes on the road, high traffic density and narrow lanes.

 <p>
  According to the
  <em>

    San Francisco Examiner
   </a>
  </em>
  , the footage was taken by a dashboard camera of a Luxor cab:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Charles Rotter, operations manager at Luxor, confirmed to the Examiner that the video was from Wednesday.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Yes, the dashcam of one of our ramp vans at 10:37 this am,” he wrote, in an email.
  </p>
  <p>
   The cab pulls up to a red light on Third Street in South of Market, by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. A pack of cars flies through a yellow light, and one even drives through the first moment of a red light.
  </p>
  <p>
   About three seconds after the light turned red, an Uber self-driving car can apparently be seen traveling through the red light at moderate speed as a pedestrian walks across the intersection on the right side of the intersection.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  While the video does show an Uber vehicle driving through a red light, it is not clear whether the vehicle was self-driven at the time. The cameras at the top of the vehicle indicate that it is capable of operating without a driver, but such vehicles can still be driven by humans — and it is entirely possible that this video shows the result of human error.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is difficult to see inside the vehicle’s window as it runs the red light, but a still shot of the image appears to show a face reflecting off the windshield:

  <br/>
  Of course, this is not definitive proof that the vehicle was being driven by a human at the time of the incident. The face may show a person in the passenger’s seat, or it may not be a face at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  Uber confirmed in a statement to
  <em>

   </a>
  </em>
  that the incident was due to human error:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   <em>
    This incident was due to human error. This is why we believe so much in making the roads safer by building self-driving Ubers. This vehicle was not part of the pilot and was not carrying customers. The driver involved has been suspended while we continue to investigate.
   </em>

  Later in the afternoon of 14 December 2016, the state of California’s Department of Motor Services ordered Uber to halt its self-driving car rides, effective immediately, as its “autonomous vehicles” were operating
  <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Uber-defies-DMV-with-self-driving-pilot-10796407.php" target="_blank">
   without
  </a>
  the proper permits:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The DMV requires a permit to use autonomous vehicles on public roads. Uber, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, had previously argued that its technology was exempt.
  </p>
  <p>
   “The rules apply to cars that can drive without someone controlling or monitoring them,” wrote Anthony Levandowski, head of Uber’s Advanced Technology Group, in a
   <a href="https://newsroom.uber.com/san-francisco-your-self-driving-uber-is-arriving-now/" target="_blank">
    blog post
   </a>
   published early Wednesday morning, before the DMV letter came out. “For us, it’s still early days, and our cars are not yet ready to drive without a person monitoring them.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  So far, twenty companies have reportedly obtained the permits to test autonomous cars on California roads.
