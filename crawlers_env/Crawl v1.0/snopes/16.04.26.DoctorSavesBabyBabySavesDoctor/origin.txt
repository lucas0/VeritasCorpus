  In 1981, a pediatrician saved the life of a 3.2-pound premature baby boy by working around the clock to beat the odds and stabilize him. In 2011, the pediatrician was pinned inside a burning vehicle after a car collision, but was saved by the premature baby, who had grown up to become a paramedic.
