  In March 2016, an image purportedly showing an ad from the
  <a href="http://www.bradycampaign.org/" target="_blank">
   Brady Campaign
  </a>
  to Prevent Gun Violence was widely circulated on Facebook. The above-displayed ad, however, was not created by the Brady Campaign, and does not appear on the Brady Campaign web site or any of their

  profiles.

  The fake ad has been circulating since at least April 2015, when it was uploaded to a WordPress blog called
  <em>
   <a href="https://maddmedic.wordpress.com/2015/04/page/10/" target="_blank">
    Madd Medic
   </a>
  </em>
  which frequently posted pro-gun rhetoric. While we can’t definitively say exactly who created the image, this fake Brady Campaign ad was saved as “Brady Spoof” by

  to clear up any confusion about the above-displayed fake ad:

  This isn’t the first time that a fake ad has been created to smear the Brady Campaign.
