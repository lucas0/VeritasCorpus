  I have a shop in a rural retail craft centre on a Lancashire country estate where there are 60 small retail shops and a tearoom. Today 4 Muslim men came in and demanded that the centre provide them with a prayer room, when one clearly wasn’t available they started to get aggressive and when they were asked to leave by the management they started making threats and kicking spouting their right. They put the fear of God into customers, many of whom are elderly, it was a truly awful and experience. They called the police and the police turned up on mass, it looked like a riot, it was awful! But to ad insult to the situation the police cleared a space upstairs to allow them to pray — wtf!!! What is happening to our Christian way of life, I’m in total disbelief, it was horrendous!
