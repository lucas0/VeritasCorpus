  Trump’s official Twitter feed retweeted this Tweet that takes a jab at GOP rival Jeb Bush. It shows a photoshopped image of Bush in front of the Trump Towers, holding up a “Vote for Trump” sign.

  Seems innocuous enough. Until you see the account it’s retweeted from: @WhiteGenocideTM.

  But that’s not even the worst of it. A @WhiteGenocideTM photoshop creation shows Trump in a Nazi uniform flipping on the gas switch on a gas chamber housing… Jewish candidate Bernie Sanders.
