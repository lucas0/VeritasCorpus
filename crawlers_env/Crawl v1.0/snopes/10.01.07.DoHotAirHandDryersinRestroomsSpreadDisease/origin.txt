  Bathroom Hand Dryers..Interesting Info
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone in the cleaning industry has always been told that hand dryers in restrooms are not sanitary; they spread germs and bacteria around.  I always thought that this just came from the paper companies because they are losing sales to the hand dryers.
 </p>
 <p>
  A couple of years ago, I was working with a rep, and I noticed that after he washed his hands and noticed that there were no paper towels, only a hand dryer, he left the restroom with wet hands.  I asked him about it. He said that hand dryers blow a lot of germs and bacteria around.  He also told me to take a look under the hand dryer next time I was in a restroom.

  There is a filter underneath the hand dryer that is supposed to be cleaned on a weekly basis.  I looked at one and it looked like it hadnâ€™t been cleaned in years.  It had layers and layers of caked on gunk (disgusting). Since then I will not use hand dryers in restrooms.

  Now this is where the story gets really interesting.  The schools and universities that have had the H1N1 (swine flue) outbreak this year are being told by the health department that they have to take out all of their hand dryers and replace them with towel dispensers because the hand dryers are spreading disease.  Please pass this along so everyone knows not to use hand dryers.
