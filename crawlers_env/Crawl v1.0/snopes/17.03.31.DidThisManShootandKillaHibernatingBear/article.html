  In March 2017, a photograph showing a man posing with a dead bear was widely
  <a href="https://archive.is/P4Y2m#selection-409.0-409.109" target="_blank">
   circulated
  </a>
  along with the claim that the animal was killed while it was hibernating thanks to a new law:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   This man posed proudly with the bear he shot while it was hibernating. The poor animal didn’t stand a chance.

  However, this is untrue; it is actually an image from the spring 2014 hunting season in Alaska’s Becharof National Wildlife Refuge, and although there are

   arguments
  </a>
  to be made both for against bear hunting, this does not show an animal that was killed while hibernating by a suddenly emboldened hunter. The
  <a href="https://archive.is/X7x3y" target="_blank">
   photograph
  </a>
  was posted to the Alaska Peninsula and BNWR Facebook page in 2016, along with the following message:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Last day for spring bear hunting is today! Whether the hunters shot their trophy bear or not, we hope everyone had a safe and enjoyable time with their guides!
  </p>
  <p>
   Bear hunting on the Peninsula alternates between spring (even years) and fall (odd years). The next big game hunting on the Refuge this year will be moose in September.

  The photograph, then, is real, but it does not show a man who took advantage of a new law to kill a hibernating bear — rather, it’s a picture of a hunter posing with the carcass carcass of a bear he killed in 2014, nearly three years before legislation putatively allowing that act was passed.
