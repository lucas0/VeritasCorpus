  Fewer than one in 80,000 pregnancies result in what is called an “en caul” birth, meaning the newborn is delivered still encased in its
  <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/2310.aspx?CategoryID=54" target="_blank">
   amniotic sac
  </a>
  (traditionally known as a “caul”) because normally the sac ruptures and releases amniotic fluid  (i.e., the mother’s “water breaks”) well before birth occurs. En caul deliveries are rare enough that some obstetricians may never attend one in their entire careers, though not so rare as to prevent multiple videos of such births from going viral on the Internet.

   “Look what I had the honor of filming in my dear Santa House Mercy,” the nurse, Gih Flor de Lis, wrote, explaining that the newborn was actually one of a set of twins, the first of whom was delivered vaginally.

   “We were waiting to stabilize the first baby and the second came softly, in fact, look there that beautiful!!! Historic moment! !!!” she wrote in the post.
