  After the 2016 U.S. general election wound down, stories of a more dangerous United States began popping up on social media. According to one such story, gay Canadian film producer

   Chris Ball

  was badly beaten outside a bar in Santa Monica, California, by several Donald Trump supporters who had been emboldened by the vote’s outcome.

  reported on the claim and shared moderately graphic Facebook

  documenting the aftermath of the purported attack:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Trump supporters shouted slurs at a gay man from Canada who was in a Santa Monica, CA bar Tuesday night watching Trump win the Presidential election, and upon leaving the bar, the man says, these supporters attacked him.
  </p>
  <p>
   Calgary filmmaker Chris Ball said that he was watching the election results when supporters of the Republican candidate began to lob epithets. ‘We got a new president you fucking faggots,” they said, Ball told Metro Calgary.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Ball left the bar alone later in the night, Trump supporters followed him to an alley way and assaulted him, Ball said. The last thing he remembers before awaking bloody on the pavement was having a beer bottle smashed over his head. Friends took him to the hospital.
