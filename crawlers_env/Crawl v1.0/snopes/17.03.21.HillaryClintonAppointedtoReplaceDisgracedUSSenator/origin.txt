  New York Governor Andrew Buono has taken it upon himself to send disgraced presidential candidate and career criminal Hillary Rodham Clinton back to the US Senate to replace Senator Vince McCallum, who was indicted for fraud just this morning. McCallum, who immediately resigned from the Senate, apologized to his constituents and the governor before surrendering himself to federal custody.

 <p>
  Under New York law, Governor Buono has the exclusive right to appoint a senator to fill the empty seat until it comes up for election, which in this case wonâ€™t be until 2020. The White House has filed an injunction in federal court to block the appointment until questions of special elections can be considered, but New York Attorney general Carlton Mendez told The New York Times that the state constitution is clear and that Cuomo is well within his rights to appoint Clinton.
