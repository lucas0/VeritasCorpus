  Many parents were outraged upon finding Principal Jackson’s letter in their children’s backpacks and took to social media websites such as Facebook to voice their disagreement with Jackson’s decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  Several parents wrote messages of their own to Principal Jackson on the letter and uploaded photos of their notes on Facebook prior to having their children deliver them back to their teachers. One such letter said,
  <strong>
   “RETURN TO SENDER: We do
   <u>
    not agree
   </u>
   with this decision and urge you to reconsider. We recommend that you keep a few things in mind prior to your reconsideration – #1) – Remember what country employs you. #2) – There are SEVERAL other elementary schools for me (and my neighbors) to send our children. Sincerely, Kathleen Hunter (An American Mom).”
