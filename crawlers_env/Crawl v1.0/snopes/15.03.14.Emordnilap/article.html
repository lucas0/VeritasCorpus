  In February 2014, the Tumblr blog
  <a href="http://wordsmythologic.tumblr.com/post/75765629628/egberts-im-really-pissed-that-palindrome-isnt" target="_blank">
   Wordsmythologic
  </a>
  shared a post declaring that “emordnilap” (i.e., “palindrome” spelled in reverse) is a word referencing “any word that, when spelled backwards, produces another word,” and therefore the phrase “emordnilap palindrome” is itself a palindrome.
 </p>
 <p>
  The post quickly went viral, leaving many readers convinced ’emordnilap’ was a word common found in English-language dictionaries. A quick search through
  <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/emordnilap" target="_blank">
   Merriam-Webster
  </a>
  and the
  <a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/spellcheck/all/?q=emordnilap" target="_blank">
   Oxford English Dictionary
  </a>
  , however, revealed that judged by the standard of dictionary inclusion, emordnilap is not yet a part of the English language.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a broad sense emordnilap might be considered a word (albeit not an “official” one) since that term, as
  <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/word" target="_blank">
   defined
  </a>
  by the aforementioned Merriam-Webster, is simply “a sound or combination of sounds that has a meaning and is spoken or written,” and emordnilap fits (albeit barely) this definition.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, it should also be noted language is constantly evolving: In 2013, “selfie” and “hashtag” were not considered words by Merriam-Webster. That changed in 2014 when more than 150 words were
  <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/new-words/2014-update.htm" target="_blank">
   added
  </a>
  to the Merriam-Webster
  <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/help/faq/words_in.htm" target="_blank">
   dictionary
  </a>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   How does a word get into a Merriam-Webster dictionary? This is one of the questions Merriam-Webster editors are most often asked. The answer is simple: usage.
  </p>
  <p>
   To decide which words to include in the dictionary and to determine what they mean, Merriam-Webster editors study the language as it’s used. They carefully monitor which words people use most often and how they use them.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  After receiving numerous questions and comments about “emordnilap” and its definition, the Wordsmythologic Tumblr page added an
  <a href="http://wordsmythologic.tumblr.com/ask" target="_blank">
   update
  </a>
  declaring emordnilap to be a word. More specifically, they maintained, it is a neologism, which is
  <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neologism" target="_blank">
   defined
  </a>
  by Merriam-Webster as “new word or expression or a new meaning of a word.”
 </p>
 <p>
  However, one searches in vain to find much usage of “emordnilap” outside of discussions about what it means and whether it’s really a word.  So given its lack of actual usage or dictionary inclusion, we’d say it currently falls short of the criteria needed to declare it a “word.”
