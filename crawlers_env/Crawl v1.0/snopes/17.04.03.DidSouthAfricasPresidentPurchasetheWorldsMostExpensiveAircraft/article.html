  A series of photographs circulated online purportedly show a luxurious $400 million custom-built Boeing 747 that was purchased by South Africa president Jacob Zuma:

   President Zuma, is the current leader of South Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   He has purchased the most expensive aircraft in the world for his own personal use and those of his hirelings and underlings. BOEING 747-8 for President Jacob Zuma
  </p>
  <p>
   Welcome aboard the custom-built plane that makes Air Force One look like The Wright Brothers’ first effort. These extraordinary images show an enormous jumbo jet that has been converted into a luxury home for ZUMA. Complete with bedrooms, multiple lounges and an on board restaurant.
  </p>
  <p>
   The custom-built Boeing 747 is believed to have cost South African taxpayers $400million. Making it one of the most expensive purchases of all time. The jumbo jet would normally carry up to 600 passengers –but this version was built for just one insane man, although he will be able to fit dozens of guests.
  </p>
  <p>
   The level of luxury is out of this world. The plane wouldn’t look out of place on Cribs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Of course cable television and Internet are among the perks. No need to fight for sofa space either, just the 14 TVs dotted about the vessel. More sleeping space is provided in the “aeroloft” on the top deck of the vessel, with eight double beds for passengers who prefer to get some shut-eye on flights.
  </p>
  <p>
   You know it’s good when your plane has a stateroom. Look out for this baby flying above you.

   Does the United States of America provide aid to South Africa? Yup- over $571,000,000!
  </p>
  <p>
   Does Canada provide aid to South Africa? Yup – over $120,000,000!
  </p>
  <p>
   Enough to pay for this toy, with a little ($291,000,00) in change leftover. Isn’t it heartwarming to see how our “Foreign Aid” is benefiting the underprivileged of other countries.

   Where did this rumor originate?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  This rumor may have started as a simple misunderstanding. Zuma’s presidential plane, a Boeing 737 called “Inkwazi,” was grounded several times due to mechanical problems, and the South African president
  <a href="http://city-press.news24.com/News/R4-billion-VIP-jet-for-Zuma-20151108" target="_blank">
   requested
  </a>
  a new luxury plane to replace it:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A private bedroom suite, a bathroom and a conference room for eight people on board. These are just some of the specifications for a brand-new presidential jet that Armscor, the defence force’s acquisitions agency, is planning to buy for President Jacob Zuma, which could cost as much as R4 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Armscor officially announced the acquisition process on its website on Thursday with a request for information from people who may be able to supply the jet. The deadline is as early as November 20, which means information must be submitted by the time the Armscor acquisitions board meets next month.
  </p>
  <p>
   Secretary for defence Sam Gulube confirmed that the department had asked Armscor to procure a VIP jet for Zuma. He said specific requirements were submitted to his office by the SA air force.
  </p>
  <p>
   “We don’t know how much it’s going to cost. Any talk about cost of such a capability is unfounded, groundless and baseless. Armscor has requested information and will only know [about the cost] once that information is received.”
