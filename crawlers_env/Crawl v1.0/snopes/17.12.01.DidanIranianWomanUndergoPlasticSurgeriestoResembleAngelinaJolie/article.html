  that Sahar Tabar had undergone “50 plastic surgery operations in just a few months” and had lost 40 kilos (around 88 pounds) in an effort to physically resemble actress Angelina Jolie.

  that stated:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Hello relatively dear followers, the picture that you’re scrutinizing, even though I didn’t like it, I kept it in … I must say I only had [indeterminate number of] surgery, not 50 surgeries, and foreign sites and channels were very biased in the way they talked about my photos. I thought these people are probably living in the 18th century and they haven’t seen or heard of technology or makeup and they are really surprised.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Tabar’s mention of technology and makeup suggested that her photographs might have been digitally altered and/or that she achieved the unusual look on display in online images in part through through the application of cosmetics or prosthetics. Tabar’s post also asserted that those who have criticized her were merely displaying “a show of jealousy and flames.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Critics have maintained in comments posted to her social media accounts that Tabar is actually employing

  in her photographs, a suspicion she confirmed in an interview published by the Russian news outlet

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   No, of course. This is Photoshop and makeup. Every time I publish a photo, I paint my face in an increasingly funny way. It is a way of expressing yourself, a kind of art. My fans know that this is not my real face.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  According to Tabar, she had only undergone three plastic surgeries: “a nose, enlarged mouth and liposuction.” She also rebuked the idea that she set out to emulate Jolie’s facial appearance:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Actually, no. I did not even think about being like Jolie. Also, I did not want to resemble the cartoon character “Rotting Bride.” Now I understand that I have something to do with them, but I am a muse myself and remembering someone is not an end in itself.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The many articles about Tabar leading up to her apparent confession did not contain any quote from a direct interview with her or a social media post from her affirming the number of surgeries she allegedly undertook, her purported dieting, or whether her actual motivation was to like the Academy Award-winning actress. A video
