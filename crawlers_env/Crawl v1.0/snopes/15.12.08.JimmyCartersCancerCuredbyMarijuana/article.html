  On 7 December 2015, the entertainment website
  <em>
   Satira Tribune
  </em>
  published an article claiming that former President Jimmy Carter said that medical marijuana had cured his cancer:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   While speaking to ABC News about the remission of his cancer, former President Jimmy Carter credited marijuana for killing of his cancer cells.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Nobel winner thanked his doctors and family for their support through his brain cancer ordeal. He also thanked Terrance ‘Scooby’ Williams of Dr. Green’s Greenery, a pot dispensary in Oakland, CA, for helping him find the right strain of cannabis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carter told his medicinal regiment to Sawyer“I smoke two joints in the morning, I smoke two joints at night, I smoke two joint in the afternoon, and it makes me feel all right.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Edibles are also good when traveling when smoking is not permitted.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  While Carter did

   announce
  </a>
  in December 2015 that he was “cancer-free,” the former President did not credit medical marijuana. The
