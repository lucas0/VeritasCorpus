  On 26 November 2016, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau sparked controversy by praising Fidel Castro in a

   <span class="s1">
    statement
   </span>
  </a>
  about the former Cuban dictator’s death, saying that “While a controversial figure, both Mr. Castro’s supporters and detractors recognized his tremendous dedication and love for the Cuban people who had a deep and lasting affection for ‘el Comandante.’ I know my father was very proud to call him a friend and I had the opportunity to meet Fidel when my father passed away. It was also a real honour to meet his three sons and his brother President Raúl Castro during my recent visit to Cuba.”

  Some Canadians (and others) were
  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/27/world/justin-trudeau-castro-eulogy-parody/" target="_blank">
   angered
  </a>
  by what they viewed as Trudeau’s humanization of a dictator who had caused profound suffering for his own people. Trudeau’s statement, as well as his family’s friendly history with Castro, led to speculation that a much harder truth lay behind his soft words.
 </p>
 <p>
  On 27 November 2016, two days after Castro’s death was announced, a user on the Donald Trump subreddit /r/The_Donald presented a
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5f6da8/justin_trudeau_is_actually_fidel_castros_son/" target="_blank">
   theory
  </a>
  that Justin Trudeau, the son of former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, was actually the love child of Fidel Castro and Margaret Trudeau.  The theory rested on three unconnected assertions: 1) Margaret Trudeau and Fidel Castro met in 1971 and were close friends ever after, 2) Margaret Trudeau was sexually promiscuous, and 3) Fidel and Justin were similar in appearance.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Trudeaus were indeed close to Fidel Castro, who once

  . The notion that the Trudeaus and the Castros met in 1971, however, is based what appears to be a willful misreading of a newspaper article by a

   So now that we’ve established the similar appearance, we need to figure out if it’s even possible that Fidel met with Margaret before Justin’s conception. Turns out he did — in fact, Pierre and Fidel met for the first time one year before Justin was born.

   article

  by the Canadian newspaper
  <em>

  , describing the first time the two leaders

  (not met) each other:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Pierre Trudeau’s and Fidel Castro’s paths crossed for the first time in 1970, when the Canadian government sought to negotiate the exile of members of the FLQ, who had kidnapped British trade commissioner James Cross. Fidel Castro obliged the Canadian PM by providing a refuge, and in a private letter Mr. Trudeau later extended his heartfelt gratitude.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The two leaders’ paths did not literally cross at that time: no head-of-state level visit took place between Cuba and Canada in 1970. (These things typically make big news.) The first time Castro and the Trudeaus met face-to-face was a famous trip made by the Canadian couple to Cuba in 1976. This event has been chronicled, along with some purportedly saucy comments, in a

  that has been cited by many of the Trudeau-truthers to suggest sexual attraction between Margaret and Fidel. But even if true that facet is a red herring, as Justin had been born well before the 1976 meeting.
 </p>
 <p>
  One doesn’t even have to believe any of that, though, as science gives us a rough estimate of when the future leader of Canada was conceived, and history can tell us where Margaret, Pierre, and Castro were during this window of opportunity.

 <p>
  Justin Trudeau was born on 25 December 1971. By means of a rough estimate, we note that a 2013 study published in the journal
  <i>
   Human Reproduction
  </i>
  used data from 130 pregnancies to investigate the range of different pregnancy lengths from conception to birth (gestation) and
