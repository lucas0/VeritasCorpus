  A nine year-old viral Facebook post that portrays the United States as soft on illegal immigration enjoyed something of a resurgence in early 2018, most likely in light of ongoing negotiations between President Donald Trump and Congressional Democrats over the fate of immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children by their undocumented parents and who have previously been allowed to stay in the United States under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

 <p>
  The wording of the post, which was turned into a meme, has been repeated since at least 2009, and has been adapted for

 <p>
  Undocumented immigrants do have some rights and entitlements, but the meme vastly overstates these entitlements, and omits to mention the many burdens and disadvantages placed on these immigrants, including the constant possibility of arrest and deportation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A job
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Adults who enter the United States illegally are not provided with a job. In fact, it’s
  <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1324a" target="_blank">
   illegal
  </a>
  to knowingly hire any immigrant who isn’t authorized to work in the country (whether they entered the United States illegally or overstayed a visa after entering legally.)
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, that doesn’t stop the practice from happening, and according to a 2017
  <a href="http://www.pewhispanic.org/2016/11/03/size-of-u-s-unauthorized-immigrant-workforce-stable-after-the-great-recession/" target="_blank">
   analysis
  </a>
  by the Pew Research Institute, there were around 8 million unauthorized immigrants working or looking for work in the United States in 2014.

   Food stamps
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  An immigrant who does not have a legal status in the United States is
  <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/snap-policy-non-citizen-eligibility" target="_blank">
   not eligible
  </a>
  for food stamps (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), although their children might be. Indeed, undocumented immigrants do not receive most kinds of welfare
  <a href="http://econofact.org/do-undocumented-immigrants-overuse-government-benefits" target="_blank">
   benefits
  </a>
  , even though they do pay taxes.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a non-partisan think tank, undocumented immigrants collectively
  <a href="https://itep.org/immigration/" target="_blank">
   contribute
  </a>
  almost $12 billion per year in state and local sales, income and property taxes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   “A place to live”
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Generally speaking, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal housing benefits like public housing, rental assistance, and vouchers.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, as a 2015 Congressional Research Service
  <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/RL31753.pdf" target="_blank">
   report
  </a>
  outlines, some undocumented immigrants may live in a household with citizens or qualified immigrants, and thereby indirectly benefit from some public housing assistance (although the level of that assistance is reduced on a pro rata basis, due to the presence of that undocumented immigrant.)
 </p>
 <p>
  Undocumented immigrants are eligible for emergency assistance such as homeless accomodation and domestic violence shelters.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is possible for an undocumented immigrant to own a home, either by buying it outright with cash, or by using something called an individual tax identification number (
  <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2017/09/08/economy/american-dream-how-undocumented-immigrants-buy-homes-us" target="_blank">
   ITIN
  </a>
  ) mortgage. This allows non-citizens (including undocumented immigrants) to bypass the usual requirement of having a social security number to take out a mortgage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some 31 percent of undocumented immigrants live in a home that is owned by at least one of its residents (as opposed to rented), according to a Migration Policy Institute
  <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/data/unauthorized-immigrant-population/state/US" target="_blank">
   analysis
  </a>
  of data from the United States Census Bureau’s 2014 American Community Survey.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Health care
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Undocumented immigrants are
  <a href="https://www.kff.org/disparities-policy/fact-sheet/health-coverage-of-immigrants/" target="_blank">
   not eligible
  </a>
  to enroll in Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) Health Insurance Marketplace, significantly curtailing the affordable health insurance and health care available to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
  <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2017/08/08/more-immigrant-children-in-us-illegally-to-receive-health-care" target="_blank">
   six states
  </a>
  and the District of Columbia have rules that allow undocumented immigrant children to avail themselves of Medicaid benefits, and undocumented immigrants are also entitled to
  <a href="http://undocumentedpatients.org/issuebrief/health-policy-and-access-to-care/" target="_blank">
   emergency
  </a>
  medical care.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to a 2017 Kaiser Family Foundation
  <a href="https://www.kff.org/disparities-policy/fact-sheet/health-coverage-of-immigrants/" target="_blank">
   analysis
  </a>
  , non-elderly undocumented immigrants are four times more likely than United States citizens to be uninsured, and fears about immigration enforcement and detection often cause undocumented immigrants to forgo preventive healthcare, leading to worse outcomes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Child benefits
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not entirely clear what the creator of this meme means by “child benefits,” but let’s take a look. Undocumented immigrant tax-payers (using an ITIN rather than a social security number) can avail themselves of a
  <a href="https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/filing/credits/itin-child-tax-credit/" target="_blank">
   child tax credit
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Low-income undocumented immigrants are also eligible for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (
  <a href="https://www.nilc.org/issues/economic-support/overview-immeligfedprograms/" target="_blank">
   WIC
  </a>
  ), which provides food and infant formula assistance, as well as nutritional and immunization assessments.
 </p>
 <p>
  Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for
  <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33809.pdf" target="_blank">
   TANF
  </a>
  (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families), a federal program that provides financial help to low-income families and pregnant women.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Education
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  In 1982, the U.S. Supreme Court
  <a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/plyler-v-doe-public-education-immigrant-students" target="_blank">
   ruled
  </a>
  that states are constitutionally barred from denying children a public school education on the basis of their immigration status. As a result, undocumented immigrant children can attend public schools for free, like any other children.
 </p>
 <p>
  While attending public schools, undocumented children can benefit from federal nutrition services like the School Breakfast
  <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/sbp/school-breakfast-program-sbp" target="_blank">
   Program
  </a>
  and National School Lunch
  <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/nslp/national-school-lunch-program-nslp" target="_blank">
   Program
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Only two states (Alabama and South Carolina) do not allow undocumented immigrants to attend public colleges and other third-level institutions, and three others (Arizona, Georgia and Indiana) do not
  <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/undocumented-student-tuition-overview.aspx" target="_blank">
   allow
  </a>
  them to pay lower in-state tuition rates, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
 </p>
 <p>
  Undocumented students are not allowed to receive
  <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/financial-aid-and-undocumented-students.pdf" target="_blank">
   federal
  </a>
  financial aid for higher education, but they might be able to get state aid or private scholarships.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A tax-free business for seven years
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  This is completely
  <a href="https://www.snopes.com/business/taxes/immigrants.asp">
   false
  </a>
  . Undocumented immigrants pay taxes, and there is no provision in law at the federal or state level which grants them any kind of “tax holiday.”
