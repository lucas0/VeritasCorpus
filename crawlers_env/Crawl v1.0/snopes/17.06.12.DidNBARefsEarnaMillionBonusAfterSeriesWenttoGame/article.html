  The Golden State Warriors were one win away from a National Basketball Association Championship when they stepped onto the court on 9 June 2017 for Game 4 of the NBA playoffs, but the Cleveland Cavaliers had other plans.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although one one could credit dominant performances by players such as LeBron James and Kyrie Irving for the Cavs’s victory, a few

   questionable
  </a>
  officiating choices led some Warriors fans to place the blame squarely on the shoulders of NBA referees. This gave The Kicker, a satirical sports web site, ample opportunity to lampoon the refs.
 </p>
 <p>
  The web site published multiple stories about NBA referees — one claimed that they played in a regular

  game with the Cavaliers’ Kyle Korver, while another reported that they

   arrested
  </a>
  all members of the Cleveland team. But evidently, the most believable story was their
  <a href="https://thekicker.com/coincidence-refs-earn-10m-bonus-if-series-goes-at-least-5-games/" target="_blank">
   claim
  </a>
  that NBA refs received a $10 million bonus after the series went to Game 5:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The utterly impartial referees were rewarded for their dispassionate and equal-sided officiating in a Finals series that looked as if it was heading to a four-game sweep with a $10 million bonus.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Is this an incentive to give the team that’s down 3-0 a bit of a boost by handing out technical fouls like a busy suburban family handing out Snickers bars on Halloween? No, I don’t think so,” NBA commissioner Adam Silver said.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  This is not a genuine news item, nor is this an accurate quote from NBA commissioner Adam Silver. The Kicker
  <em>
  </em>
  is a satire web site that is part of the
  <a href="https://aboveaverage.com/about/" target="_blank">

  <em>
  </em>
  comedy network.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the web site does not contain a disclaimer specifically stating that its content is fictional, the publication’s humorous intent is noted in several locations. For instance, at the bottom of this article is a joke stating that the site’s author’s “can’t play sports, but (they) can make jokes about them,” and the web site’s tagline is “For fans. For fun.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The alleged quote from Silver does not appear in any credible publication.
 </p>
 <p>
  The story about NBA referees being awarded a $10 million bonus after the NBA Finals extended to Game 5 is a piece of satire. However, like most satire, it is rooted in some truth; ESPN

  <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/19565518/nba-playoffs-warriors-sweep-bottom-line-not-look-wonderful" target="_blank">
   reported
  </a>
  that the Warriors would miss out on more than $20 million if the playoffs ended after Game 4:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Golden State Warriors are two games from pulling off a complete sweep of the NBA playoffs, something that has never been done. It would be a tremendous accomplishment, but it could also prove costly.
  </p>
  <p>
   Team executives have said in the past that they’d rather win than think about the money they’re leaving on the table by not taking a series longer. But the money is hardly something to sneeze at.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fact, a Game 5 in Oakland alone comes close to paying Steph Curry’s salary for the entire 2016-17 season: $12.1 million. All told, sweeping the series in Cleveland and not returning twice to the Bay Area, as the Warriors did last year for Games 5 and 7, would cost the Warriors’ ownership group more than $22 million.
