  The post says that the object was seen by residents. But that’s not true, since there is no other proof besides this video and no

   official mention of the event. Secondly, the video is only 30 seconds long and nobody is talking while the person is recording it, meaning that it meets all the characteristics of an animation. Most of the video is blurry and as I’ve said below, this is done to camouflage the animation… In conclusion, in our opinion the video is fake and just an animation rendered via computer. Judge for yourselves.
