  The video’s caption reads: “When you’re trying to vlog and get hit by a fish.”

  The woman in the video is Aimee Bannister, who isn’t actually a weather reporter: She’s part of the Welsh travel and adventure

  It’s not clear whether people shared it because they believed it was real, or simply because watching someone get hit in the face with a fish is very funny. The incident was given further attention when it was reported with pun-filled

  Third, the wave comes down at Aimee from behind her, while the fish seemingly flies out of nowhere (looking as though someone tossed it at her head) from a position in front of her.  So while a woman in Wales really did get hit in the face with a fish, it doesn’t appear that the incident was anything but staged.  One might call it a bit fishy.
