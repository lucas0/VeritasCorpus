  On 8 January 2016, the entertainment web site
  <em>
   The Reporterz
  </em>
  published an article reporting that Delaware had created a new “child support card” that controlled “what mothers can and cannot buy” with their child support funds:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   This measure was taken to prevent parents from misusing funds that are meant to help with costs associated with raising children, such as school related expenses, food, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
   This card will not be allow the parent to purchase alcohol, cigarettes or pay car payments the card will be used exactly like a food stamp card.
  </p>
  <p>
   We spoke to Tasha Brown who was upset after she couldn’t purchase a bottle of Hennessy at her local liquor store. she says “Its’ [sic] unfair its [sic] my money I should be able to do what i want with it how will I pay for my new weave?”
