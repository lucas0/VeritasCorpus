   An intoxicated school principal at a Springfield, Ohio middle school was arrested Friday morning after defecating in front of hundreds of students during the pledge of allegiance.
  </p>
  <p>
   Andrew Whitmore, 53, was “visibly under the influence of alcohol,” according to witnesses, when he decided to take down his pants and defecate on the schoolyard in front of disturbed students and teachers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mr. Whitmore, a registered Democrat, also embarrassed himself further when he lost his balance and “
   <em>
    fell to the ground into his own pile of feces
   </em>
   ” before passing out. He was eventually carried away by local police officers.
