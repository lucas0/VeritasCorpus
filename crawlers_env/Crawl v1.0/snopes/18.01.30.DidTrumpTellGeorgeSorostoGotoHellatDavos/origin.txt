  A female reporter with a German accent asked President Trump, who had just taken his seat, “Why are you smiling so broadly, like the cat that got the cream?“
 </p>
 <p>
  Before President Trump could answer, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, seated on the far left in the photo, said, “He is smiling because he just told George Soros to go to hell.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Mainstream media from around the world reported on George Soros’ speech at Davos, which he dedicated entirely to criticizing President Trump. Attempting to convince the world that Trump’s presidency is “a danger to the world.“
