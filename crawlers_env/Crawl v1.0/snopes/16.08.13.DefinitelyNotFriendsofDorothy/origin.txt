  No one on the club was ready for an ugly incident that marred an exhibition-game trip to Las Vegas. After the game, in which the Giants beat the Indians again, the team was invited to visit one of the casinos for food and entertainment on the house. Mays took in a show with Roger Kahn, then wandered over to the dice tables, where he stood quietly watching the game. Suddenly a thuggish security man accosted Kahn, saying, “Get your friend away from the dice tables. We don’t want him mixing with the white guests.”

  Kahn was indignant. The casino had asked Mays and the team to come in, after all. “Do you know who he is?” Kahn demanded.

 <p>
  “Yeah. I know who he is,” said the security man. “He’s a nigger. Get that nigger away from the white guests.”
