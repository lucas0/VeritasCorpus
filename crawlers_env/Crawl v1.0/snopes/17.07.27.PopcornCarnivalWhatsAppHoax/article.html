  Versions of the warning circulated on Facebook as well as WhatsApp, but nothing that we found included any explanation about what sort of risk the “hacking” of phones might pose.

  It appears the warning began circulating among Spanish-speaking users of WhatsApp. Following a 2 July 2017

If the virus were real, many users would have encountered and unwittingly opened the attachment despite the circulating warning by now.
