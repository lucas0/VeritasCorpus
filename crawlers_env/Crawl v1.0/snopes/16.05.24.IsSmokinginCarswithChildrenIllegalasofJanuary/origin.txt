  #1 No More Smoking In Cars With Children
 </p>
 <p>
  The law, that becomes effective on January 30, 2018 is to protect children from secondhand smoking. Violations would result in a fine of up to $100.
 </p>
 <p>
  #2 Thousands Of Chemicals
 </p>
 <p>
  According to the Department of Health, when a child breathes in secondhand smoke, they breathe in thousands of chemicals, just like the smoker does. This puts them at risk of serious conditions including cancer, bronchitis, and pneumonia. And it can worsen asthma.
 </p>
 <p>
  #3 All Private Vehicles
 </p>
 <p>
  The law applies to any private vehicle that is enclosed wholly or partly by a roof. It still applies if people have the windows or sunroof open, have the air-conditioning on, or if they sit in a parked car with the door open.
