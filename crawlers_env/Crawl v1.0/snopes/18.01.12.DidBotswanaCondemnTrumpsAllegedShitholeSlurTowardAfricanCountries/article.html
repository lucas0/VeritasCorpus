  The Botswanan government condemned President Donald Trump’s purported remarks referring to African countries “

  Botswana officials noted that they had “summoned” U.S. Ambassador Earl R. Miller regarding the  statements that President Trump had made during a meeting with lawmakers a day earlier, during which the chief executive allegedly exclaimed: “What do we want Haitians here for? Why do we want all these people from Africa here? Why do we want all these people from shithole countries?”
 </p>
 <p>
  The statement from Botswana said (in part):
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Botswana Government has also enquired from the US Government through the Ambassador, to clarify if Botswana is regarded as a “shithole” country given that there are Botswana nationals residing in the US, and also that some of Botswana may wish to visit the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Government of Botswana is wondering why President Trump, must use this descriptor and derogatory word, when talking about countries with whom the US has had cordial and mutually beneficial bilateral relations for so many years.

   Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said “take them out.” Made up by Dems. I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings — unfortunately, no trust!
