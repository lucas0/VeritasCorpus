  ) on a 2017 visit to Colombia:

  This footage shows a man dressed up in a pope costume at a Halloween party. In the video, you can clearly see Halloween decorations (a large spider and cobwebs) on the ceiling and a couple dressed as skeletons on the dance floor:

  Facebook user Fredy Gonzalez posted the earliest iteration of the video that we could find on 1 November 2017 (the day after Halloween). Gonzalez
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fredyjavierg/videos/10213810491152097/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   joked
  </a>
  that the video showed “the reality of the Pope’s visit” to Colombia, which had occurred a few
  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/10/world/americas/pope-francis-colombia.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   months
  </a>
  before. When some commenters didn’t seem to understand the joke, Gonzalez said in Spanish, “Haha don’t get bitter that it’s fake. The Pope is Argentine — why would he dance with that Colombian flavor?”
 </p>
 <p>
  In case it still wasn’t clear, he added:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Pope Francis, is that you?

  Although the quality of this footage deteriorated as it was circulated around the internet, the original footage gives a pretty clear view of the “dancing pope,” who appears to be much younger and taller than Pope Francis.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Pope’s actual visit was well-documented, and no genuine

  sources made mention of the Holy Father attending a Halloween party to do the merengue.
