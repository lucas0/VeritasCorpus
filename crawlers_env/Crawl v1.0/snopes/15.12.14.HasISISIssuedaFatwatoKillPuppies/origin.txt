 <p>
  A chilling report issued by the Main Intelligence Directorate General Staff of the Armed Forces (GRU) is warning today that the pet dogs and puppies of American owners have now become “
  <i>
   targets for death
  </i>
  ” after the Islamic State’s (ISIS/ISIL/Daesh) top religious scholar, Turki al-Bin‘ali, issued a
  <i>
   fatwa
  </i>
  authorizing the immediate mass slaughter of these beloved animals by their terrorist supporters currently residing in the United States.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to this report, this Islamic legal pronouncement (fatwa) issued by the Islamic State Caliphates main ideological-religious leader, who currently resides under the protection of the US at their Bahrain naval base (NSAB), was in response to queries from many of their younger American “
  <i>
   sympathizers/supporters
  </i>
  ” wanting to wage jihad but fearful of being captured or killed—or not being of sufficient age to “
  <i>
   obtain/purchase
  </i>
  ” weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  Turki al-Bin‘ali’s response to these American followers, as outlined in his fatwa published earlier today in the Islamic State’s online magazine Dabiq, this report continues, was that while although the main duty of jihad was to “
  <i>
   kill/destroy/main
  </i>
  ” as many infidels (non-believers/Christians/Jews, etc.) as possible, no matter what the cost, it is entirely acceptable, also, to strike fear into these Westerners by the mass murdering of their dogs and puppies.
