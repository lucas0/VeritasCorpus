  An image purportedly showing a game show contestant on the
  <em>
   Who Wants to Be a Millionaire
  </em>
  quiz show being asked a confusing question concerning the first letter in the English alphabet has been circulating online since at least 2007.

  While the above-displayed screenshot was taken from an actual television show, the above image does not show a real question featured on
  <em>
   Who Wants to Be a Millionaire
  </em>
  game show. The above-displayed image actually comes from an Australian sketch comedy show called

    Comedy Inc: The Late Shift

  <em>
   The Late Shift
  </em>
  and not the logo for
  <em>
   Who Wants to Be a Millionaire
  </em>
  .
