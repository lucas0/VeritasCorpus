  <em>
   We’re already on the ballot in 23 states (including the District of Columbia). But we need your help to get on the ballot in the remaining states listed below. A list of Ballot Access Coordinators can be found here.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  High-priority states are Connecticut and New Hampshire.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you live in a state where we’re already on the ballot, you might be allowed to travel to a neighboring state to petition—if the state law allows. Please check in with the specific state’s coordinator(s) to find out and to plan.
