   Hip-Hop artist Nelly was arrested by a Tennessee state trooper and was charged with felony possession of drugs and possession of drug paraphernalia. According to a press released, around 9:20 a. m. , Nelly, whose real name is Cornell Haynes, was riding in a Prevost motor coach bus when it was stopped by a trooper. Police say the bus failed to display a U. S Department of Transportation sticker and an International Fuel Tax Association sticker.

   After a search was conducted, they found five rocks that tested positive for meth, a small amount of marijiuana as well as drug paraphernalia. Several handguns were also found in the bus. Another man, Brian Jones, was charged with being a felon in possession of a handgun.

   Instead of heading to trial, the rapper agreed to participate in Tennessee’s pretrial diversion program, where he’ll be put on probation and could have his record cleared if he stays out of trouble, court officials in Putnam County, Tn. confirmed to BOSSIP.
