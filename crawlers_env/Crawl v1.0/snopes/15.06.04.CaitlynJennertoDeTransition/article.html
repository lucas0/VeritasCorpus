  On 3 June 2015, the web site
  <em>
   Huzlers
  </em>
  published an article reporting that Caitlyn Jenner had decided to transition back to male:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   After breaking a twitter record for the quickest person to reach one million followers in just four hours, Caitlyn Jenner, formerly known as Bruce Jenner, has announced that he regrets becoming a female and wants to be a man again.
  </p>
  <p>
   Caitlyn Jenner has reached massive publicity in the last few days after his/her appearance on the front cover of Vanity Fair. Caitlyn Jenner has even won the ESPY courage award, somehow.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  There is no truth to the article.
  <em>
   Huzlers
  </em>
  is one of many fake news sites that aims to drive traffic by penning fictitious articles about trending issues:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Huzlers.com is the most notorious urban satirical entertainment website with the most shocking headlines and articles.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The site has previously published fictitious stories about a man
  <a href="/media/notnews/applewatch.asp" target="SEL">
   selling
  </a>
  his son for an Apple Watch and human urine being
  <a href="/media/notnews/arizonatea.asp" target="BEI">
   found
  </a>
  in cans of AriZona Iced Tea. The site is prominently featured on Snopes.com’s “

  ” list.

  <em>
   Huzlers
  </em>
  wasn’t the only web site that attempted to capitalize on the transphobia that descended on the web after Caitlyn Jenner’s
  <em>
   Vanity Fair
  </em>
  cover. In addition to the baseless
  <a href="/2015/06/02/caitlyn-jenner-arthur-ashe-espys/" target="RUM">
   rumor
  </a>
  that Jenner had won the Arthur Ashe Courage Award over “runner up” Noah Galloway, another “entertainment” web site
  <a href="http://www.donotlink.com/ff1m" target="_blank">
   penned
  </a>
  a fake article claiming that Kris Jenner was planning to transition to male so that she could get back together with Caitlyn Jenner.
 </p>
 <p>
  In May 2016, the story re-circulated, given slightly more
  <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/caitlyn-jenner-experienced-sex-change-regret-might-de-transition-biographer-says/" target="_blank">
   credibility
  </a>
  by Kardashian family biographer Ian Halperin, who quoted “anonymous sources”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Ian Halperin, the author of
   <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kardashian-Dynasty-Controversial-Americas-Family-ebook/dp/B010MH1AFY" target="_blank">
    “Kardashian Dynasty: The Controversial Rise of America’s Royal Family,”
   </a>
   said that, while researching his book, multiple sources told him that the former Olympian had been miserable for months and has considered transitioning back to a man.
  </p>
  <p>
   “One source confirmed to me Caitlyn has made whispers of ‘sex change regret,’ hinting she might go back to being Bruce Jenner,” Halperin said.
  </p>
  <p>
   Halperin said that one long-time friend told him that, while Jenner was “thrilled” to champion transgender issues, the reality TV personality could de-transition “in the next couple years.”

 <p>
  Jenner’s representative immediately
  <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/caitlyn-jenner-rep-slams-report-considered-de-transition-article-1.2634440" target="_blank">
   dismissed
  </a>
  the claims:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Not worth commenting on such an idiotic report…. Of course it’s not true.
