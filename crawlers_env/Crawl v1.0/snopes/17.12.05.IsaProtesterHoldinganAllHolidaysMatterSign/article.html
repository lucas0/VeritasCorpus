  The so-called “
  <a href="https://www.snopes.com/2017/11/29/the-war-on-christmas/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   War on Christmas
  </a>
  ” has a long, complicated, and racially-charged history beset with hoaxes and rumors, but its participants can generally be categorized into two camps: Those who say “Merry Christmas,” and those who don’t.

  As we entered the holiday season in 2017, an old image purportedly showing two soldiers in this holiday war — one holding a sign saying “We must stop the war on Christmas,” and the other holding a sign reading “All holidays matter” —

  The photograph is real, in that it shows two men holding signs, but the slogans on them have been digitally altered. The “All holidays matter” sign is a play on “all lives matter,” a slogan that grew out of a reaction to the Black Lives Matter
  <a href="https://blacklivesmatter.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   movement
  </a>
  . This is particularly noteworthy, because the original photograph this digital manipulation was based on was taken during a 2014 protest against police violence.

  The original image was taken in Los Angeles in 2014, when hundreds of people took to the streets to

   A crowd of nearly a thousand gathered outside the headquarters of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) on Sunday, August 17, 2014 to express their outrage the excessive use of deadly force against an unarmed citizen population.
