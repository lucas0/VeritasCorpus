  This is what you are supporting when you purchase cosmetics/beauty products that are tested on animals such as: L’Oreal, Lancôme, MAC, Estée Lauder, Cover Girl, Revlon, Maybelline, Clinique, Olay, Neutrogena, etc. Just to name a few, there are tons, tons, tons, more! Especially with all the companies that recently expanded their market to China.

  P.S. – It’s not just rabbits and mice, it’s cats and dogs too.
