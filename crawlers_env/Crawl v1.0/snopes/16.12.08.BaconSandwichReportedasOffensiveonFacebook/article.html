  On 23 November 2016, the Facebook page “I Am Proud To Be English”

  The meme read:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I actually had this reported on my timeline as been offensive!!
  </p>
  <p>
   Is it?
  </p>
  <p>
   How many people dare to like and share it?
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Tens of thousands answered the call, though many of the post’s top comments expressed skepticism about the claim on several levels:

   At least one person noticed that claims that the bacon sandwich was reported as offensive did not mesh with the wide circulation of the photograph after it was posted:

  <!--If it was reported as being offensive, why has it not been removed and deleted by Facebook ? Is it because this post is actually a lie to stir up hatred ? Maybe, because if you send a copy to the Facebook censors they will tell you it does not contravene any of their rules.-->

  Doubters were correct in suspecting the bacon sandwich picture was unlikely to be flagged by Facebook. The social network’s Community Standards
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards" target="_blank">
   held
  </a>
  that only the following content is subject to review and removal: Direct Threats, Self-Injury, Dangerous Organizations, Bullying and Harassment, Attacks on Public Figures, Criminal Activity, Sexual Violence and Exploitation, and Regulated Goods. We could find no appropriate category under which the image would be restricted via a report.
 </p>
 <p>
  In response to an earlier but similar rumor, a representative for Facebook told us that images which do not violate Facebook’s Community Standards would not be removed from their platform.
