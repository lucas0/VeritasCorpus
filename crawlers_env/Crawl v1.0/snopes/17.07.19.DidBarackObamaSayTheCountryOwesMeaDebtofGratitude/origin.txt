  Obama: The Country Deserves [sic] Me A Debt Of Gratitude For My Leadership
 </p>
 <p>
  During Barack Obama’s final press conference Friday afternoon, he spent a majority of the time patting himself on the back.
 </p>
 <p>
  Obama told a room full of reporters that after eight years of his presidency, the United States is stronger, in better shape, and more respected across the world than ever before.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did eight years ago.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Compiling a list of reasons why Barack Obama is a terrible president seems like a project for a book rather than a column, but I am sure many of you agree that Obama will undoubtedly go down as one of the worst presidents in American history.
 </p>
 <p>
  We don’t even need to choose one failure of his – the list of catastrophic failures will forever place the United States in a bad position.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our allies no long trust or respect us while our enemies no long fear us. Obama is right, he did accomplish all of that on his own.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s clear that he’s been a disaster for America on a scale that few other presidents can match. Just look at his record. What’s worse, his blatantly disrespectful attitude stinks of entitlement a
  <em>
   [sic]
  </em>
  delusional thinking; Obama literally thinks we owe him something for his “leadership”.
 </p>
 <p>
  How does it make you feel to read that he thinks he will go down as one of the greatest presidents in our history?
