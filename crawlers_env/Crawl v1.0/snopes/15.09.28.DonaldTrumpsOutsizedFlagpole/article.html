  This anecdote about Donald Trump and his outsized U.S. flag and pole neatly encapsulates what so many people find either most appealing or most distasteful about the business magnate and 2016 Republican presidential candidate: to some he’s the no-nonsense take-charge type who has the power and influence to thwart those who would insist on allowing the enforcement of petty rules or “political correctness” impede the progress of business and the course of “making America great again”; to others he’s a wealthy blowhard who thinks the rules don’t apply to him and habitually bullies others into submission to feed his lust for self-aggrandizement and self-enrichment.
 </p>
 <p>
  The basic facts are these: In 1985, Donald Trump paid $10 million for
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   Mar-A-Lago,
  </span>
  the name of the Marjorie Merriweather Post estate in Palm Beach, Florida.  On
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   3 October
  </span>
  2006, Trump had an outsized American flag (variously described as being either
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   15×25 feet
  </span>
  or
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   20×30 feet
  </span>
  ) installed on an
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   80-foot-
  </span>
  high flagpole at
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   Mar-a-Lago,
  </span>
  in violation of local zoning regulations that established a maximum size of
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   4×6 feet
  </span>
  for flags and a maximum height of
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   42 feet
  </span>
  for flagpoles.  Trump put up his regulation-violating flag and pole without obtaining either a building permit permit or a variance from local authorities, and the Palm Beach town council accordingly fined him $1,250 (or, in some accounts, $250) for every day the flag remained in place (apparently citing him only for the pole but not the flag itself). Trump in turn filed a
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   $25 million
  </span>
  lawsuit against Palm Beach, claiming that the town was selectively enforcing its rules (by not fining other properties that were flying flags in violation of town ordinances) and infringing his constitutional right to free speech.
 </p>
 <p>
  Six months later the two sides finally reached an agreement during “secret, court-ordered negotiations,” with the town agreeing to waive all fines against Trump for his code-busting flagpole and to “review its ordinances and codes dealing with flagpoles and flags during the next zoning season,” and Trump agreeing to drop his lawsuit, lower the height of his flagpole from 80 to
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   70 feet,
  </span>
  obtain a permit for the pole and move it farther inland, and donate $100,000 “to charities dealing with Iraq War Veterans, [the] American Flag, or the local VA hospital.”
 </p>
 <p>
  So, the example reproduced above is true in its broad strokes, although all of the numbers it cites (dollar amounts and dimensions) are inaccurate, the issue was resolved via court-ordered mediation (not by Trump’s “proposing a solution”), and the money Trump agreed to donate to settle the matter went to organizations selected by both sides (although Trump had previously stated that if he won his
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   15×25 feet
  </span>
  or
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   $25 million
  </span>
  lawsuit, the proceeds would go to military members returning from Iraq).  We also haven’t been able to verify whether Trump connived to maintain (or even exceed) the height of the original pole by installing a
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   10-foot-
  </span>
  shorter pole on a
  <span style="white-space: nowrap">
   20-foot-
  </span>
  high hill — pictures of the estate show the flagpole rising from a mound, but the height of the mound is difficult to estimate from photographs:

   Trump’s lawsuit maintained that he couldn’t bring his flag and pole into compliance with regulations because  “A smaller flag and pole on Mar-A-Lago’s property would be lost given its massive size, look silly instead of make a statement, and most importantly would fail to appropriately express the magnitude of Donald J. Trump’s and the Club’s members’ patriotism.” In his statements to the news media at the time he typically framed the issue as being one of his standing up to anti-American, anti-flag, anti-patriotic forces, while acknowledging that he hadn’t even bothered applying for a permit first (because he didn’t think he’d get one) and stating that he didn’t believe rules should apply to the American flag (and therefore to him in this instance):

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “Well, I put up an American flag on the front of the
   <span style="white-space: nowrap">
    Mar-a-Lago
   </span>
   Club, which is a great house, probably the greatest house in America that I turned into a private club very successfully in Palm Beach, Florida. And the flag is very proudly waving, and the town wants me to take it down. Because they say I put it up without a permit and, frankly, had I gone to the town for a permit they wouldn’t have given it to me, probably. But more importantly, I say that you don’t need a permit to put up the American flag.
  </p>
  <p>
   I don’t think they know what their beef is. I’m not sure they really understand what their beef is. They don’t talk about the flag. They only talk about the flagpole because they’re afraid politically to mention the word flag and the American flag and take it down.
  </p>
  <p>
   And I’ll say it’s probably one of the most popular things I’ve ever done because we’ve had hundreds and hundreds of letters and thousands of requests for everything supporting the flag. Everybody wants it. Everybody wants it up. But the town wants me to take down the American flag, and I told them I’m not doing that.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is probably the wealthiest town — it is the wealthiest town in America, in the United States, and frankly it’s a town that wants me to take down a flag and they shouldn’t be asking for that.
  </p>
  <p>
   So it’s been a very, very problematic situation. I’ll be responding to them very shortly. And you know, I’m a big — I’m a very patriotic guy. I’m very proud of the country, and I don’t want to take down the American flag. And I don’t believe you need permits to put up the American flag.”
