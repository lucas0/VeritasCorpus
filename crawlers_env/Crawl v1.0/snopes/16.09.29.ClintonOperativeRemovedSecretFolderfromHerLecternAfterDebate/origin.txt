  It’s just a few seconds of video, but it is a few seconds that changes everything. A Hillary staffer, who is called the “Cleaner,” swooped in after she walked away from her podium, and he took all the papers that were on her podium. He put her notes in a file and carried them under his arm as he looked over at moderator Lester Holt.

  The Cleaner then walked to the side of the stage, not sure of where to go. He waited for a moment until Holt got up, and then the “Cleaner” started to walk toward Holt. They met at mid-stage as the “Cleaner” looked intently at Holt.

 <p>
  Holt’s face cannot be seen in the clip, but as they brushed past each other, the “Cleaner” seemed like he wanted to hand over the notes to Holt, but then he just nods. Again, it’s just a few seconds, but when you watch it from the time the “Cleaner” swoops in and clears Hillary’s podium to when he walks over to Holt, it is evident that something fishy is going on.
