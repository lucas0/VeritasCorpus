  On 1 March 2017, a Reddit user posted a picture of two lions bearing manes and a

  indicating that five “lionesses in Botswana have grown manes, developed a deeper roar to defend off rivals and even fight for territory”:

  This is a factual statement. Though rare, the phenomenon of female lions growing manes and exhibiting other masculine traits has been documented both in the wild and in
  <a href="http://www.nzg.ac.za/newsletter/issues/29/06.php" target="_blank">
   captivity
  </a>
  . The specific group of lions in Botswana discussed in the Reddit thread is the most thoroughly documented example of the phenomenon, with a two-year observational
  <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aje.12360/abstract" target="_blank">
   study
  </a>
  of these lions having been published in the
  <em>
   African Journal of Ecology
  </em>
  on 24 August 2016.
  <em>
   New Scientist
  </em>
  later
  <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2106866-five-wild-lionesses-grow-a-mane-and-start-acting-like-males/" target="_blank">
   recounted
  </a>
  that report’s context and findings:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Male lions are distinguished by their mane, which they use to attract females, and they roar to protect their territory or call upon members of their pride. Females lack a mane and are not as vocal.
  </p>
  <p>
   But sometimes lionesses grow a mane and even behave a bit like males. However, until now, reports of such maned lionesses have been extremely rare and largely anecdotal. We knew they existed, but little about how they behave.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The researchers collected data on five lionesses that had developed manes in Botswana’s Okavango Delta. In addition to the physical appearance of a mane, the researchers also documented behavioral differences, including vocal calls and scent-marking behavior more typical of males. Lead author Geoffrey D. Gilfillan, a researcher at the University of Sussex,
  <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2106866-five-wild-lionesses-grow-a-mane-and-start-acting-like-males/" target="_blank">
   observed
  </a>
  these changes in the primary target of observations, a maned female with the ID SaF05:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “While SaF05 is mostly female in her behaviour — staying with the pride, mating males — she also has some male behaviours, such as increased scent-marking and roaring, as well as mounting other females.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although females do roar and scent-mark like males, they usually do so less frequently “SaF05, however, was much more male-like in her behaviour, regularly scent-marking and roaring.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Despite the frequent copulation, however, SaF05 never once became pregnant — an observation that led the researchers to speculate that the behavioral and physical changes were associated with infertility.

   photograph
  </a>
  from Botswana of what appeared to be two male lions mating went viral in April 2016, but this photo was later determined to have captured a lion and a maned lioness mating. In discussing that photograph in
  <em>
   National Geographic,
  </em>
  Luke Hunter, president of the big-cat conservation group Panthera,
  <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/160418-lions-mating-africa-animals-science/" target="_blank">
   suggested
  </a>
  it was possible the development of maned lionesses could be either genetic or a fetal development:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The genetic contribution of the sperm — which determines the sex of the fetus in most mammals — [could be] aberrant, giving rise to a female with some male characteristics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alternatively and perhaps more likely, the problem may have occurred during gestation if the fetus was exposed to increased levels of androgens—male hormones such as testosterone.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Testosterone is likely a big part of the story. As
  <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2106866-five-wild-lionesses-grow-a-mane-and-start-acting-like-males/" target="_blank">
   noted
  </a>
  in
  <em>
   New Scientist
  </em>
  , a captive lioness at the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa
  <a href="http://www.nzg.ac.za/newsletter/issues/29/06.php" target="_blank">
   developed
  </a>
  a mane back in 2011 that disappeared after her testosterone levels were corrected. Infertility, the story pointed out, is a side effect of elevated testosterone in females as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it is unclear what specifically causes the elevated testosterone, Lead author Gilfillan also
  <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2106866-five-wild-lionesses-grow-a-mane-and-start-acting-like-males/" target="_blank">
   thinks
  </a>
  the cause is likely genetic:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Given all five known maned females [in the wild] come from the Okavango region, there must be a genetic component in this population underlying the phenomenon.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  According to
  <em>
   New Scientist
  </em>
  , this is not an active area of research — so it may be some time before we have more answers about the origin of the phenomenon.
