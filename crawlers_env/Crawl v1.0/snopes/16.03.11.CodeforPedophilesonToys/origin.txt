  Here’s what the heart means.
  <strong>
   When a pedophile sees children with the heart symbol, it’s a code. It means this child is ready to be traded for sex.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Pasco Detective Anthony Bassone has been with the agency for more than 16 years. He has one tough job every day. And, what he encounters, he can’t forget. He has to see the worst of the worst. He picks out pedophiles online and busts them, along with two other detectives in the cyber crimes unit at the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office.
 </p>
 <p>
  These investigators have to deal with the most horrendous, gut-wrenching, heartbreaking material. Sadly, they see children tortured and raped on a daily basis.
 </p>
 <p>
  These crime-fighters make it through with their motivation to protect children and keep them safe. What drives these detectives to do their jobs and face another day, they told us, is to put the bad guys away.
