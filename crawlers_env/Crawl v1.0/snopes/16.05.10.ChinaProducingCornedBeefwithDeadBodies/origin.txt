  Capcom is sponsoring an art installation in East London. That sounds innocuous, except that said art installation is at the Smithfield Meat Market, and is called “Wesker &amp; Son Resident Evil Human Butchery.”
  <br>
   Well, that’s certainly one way to get attention for next week’s release of
   <em>
    Resident Evil 6
   </em>
   .

  The meat market is not, of course, selling actual human meat, but they are selling meat, mostly pork varieties, rather disturbingly shaped to resemble humans. Along with a variety of human ears, hands, feet, and heads, brave consumers can also purchase carefully recreated sausage fingers and, yes, phalluses.
