  My name is Catherine Elizabeth Clennan and my whole life I have been trying to live by other’s definitions of who I ‘should be’. I have been trying so hard to live this lie that I came face to face with a choice: either live as others definitions of you and die OR strike out on your own and find for yourself who you really are. Well I chose life. I chose to live by my own definition … With this choice I am in the process of turning my life in a new direction. Currently I live in Laramie, Wyoming. in a property owned by my family. They pay everything for me – and I am 27 years old. I feel that as long as I live by their definition I am ‘taken care of’, but this definition is leading me to deaths door – it forces me to live a lie – to turn my back to who I really am; a free spirit, an artist, a woman, a lesbian, a civil rights activist, a woman who goes against the grain, a woman who knows that not everything is as it seems.

  <strong>
   I need $2,000,000 dollars to purchase my dream home in California. I need the money to help me walk out of the lie that I am living, but more importantly I need the money to live my dream
  </strong>
  – which is to live as much as my life in the spiritual dimension as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  The money will go towards the purchase of a new home, new transportation, and the various fees and taxes that accumulate with a move across the country.
 </p>
 <p>
  These funds will help me live the life that I feel I am meant to live, the life I want to live – the life defined not by other people – but by me. These funds will help me break free from the tyranny of what other people think is ‘right’. The ‘right’ job, the ‘right’ education, the ‘right’ way to earn a living…
