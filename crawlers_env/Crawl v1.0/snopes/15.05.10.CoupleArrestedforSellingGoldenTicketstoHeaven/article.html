  published an article reporting that two people were arrested in Jacksonville, Florida, for selling golden tickets that guaranteed the holders entrance to heaven upon their demise:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Tito and Amanda Watts were arrested over the weekend for selling golden tickets to heaven to hundreds of people. The couple, who sold the tickets on the street for $99.99 per ticket, told buyers the tickets were made from solid gold and each ticket reserved the buyer a spot in
   <nobr>
    heaven — simply
   </nobr>
   present the ticket at the pearly gates and you’re in.
  </p>
  <p>
   “People can sell tickets to heaven,” a Jacksonville police spokesman said. “But the Watts misrepresented their product. The tickets were just wood spray painted gold with ‘Ticket to
   <nobr>
    Heaven — Admit
   </nobr>
   One’ written in marker. You can’t sell something as gold when it’s not. That’s where the Watts crossed the line into doing something illegal.”
