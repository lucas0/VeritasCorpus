Capital Gains Tax went from 15% to 28%

  2016 due to the provisions of the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as “Boamacare”) was circulated widely at the beginning of 2016, but it was merely an updated version of identical claims circulated in previous years that set 2014 or 2015 as the imposition date for those tax increases:

At the height of the tax season in 2014, the intensity of circulation of the original item increased, with the date polished up to make it appear as if this ominous list of tax jumps newly (and quietly) hit Americans in July 2014. In October 2014, a version attributed to "Barrington Financial Advisors, Inc." revived the <NOBR>e-mail</NOBR>.

  Although the tax increases listed in this item did come to pass, they took effect at the beginning of 2013 (not 2014 or 2015 or 2016), were completely unrelated to the Affordable Care Act, applied only to very high-income earners, and have been overstated in this list.  These tax hikes were enacted through the passage of the

   American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012

  , a compromise bill pushed through Congress as a partial resolution to the then-looming “

     The top marginal federal income tax rate increased from 35% to 39.6%
