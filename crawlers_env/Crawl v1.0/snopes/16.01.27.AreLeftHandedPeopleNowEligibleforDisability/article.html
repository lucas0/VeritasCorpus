  In January 2016, a
  <em>
   Mouthwire
  </em>
  article originally published back on 7 February 2015 and headlined “Left-Handed People Now Eligible for Disability” was widely circulated via Facebook.  That article referenced news from the purported “Left-Handed Nondiscrimination Association”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   As of February 1st, people suffering from severe cases of left-handedness may be eligible to receive social security benefits.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lefties everywhere celebrated a long awaited victory with the passing of the Justice for Dexterously Challenged Act, which adds left-handedness to the growing list of recognized disabilities.The JDC Act was readily welcomed by President Barack Obama (pictured above), who is left-handed himself. He carefully signed the document, taking not to smear the ink, a common problem among lefties.
  </p>
  <p>
   With over 33 million new eligible Americans, applications are already pouring in.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Neither “the Left-Handed Nondiscrimination Association” nor the “Justice for Dexterously Challenged Act” exists. All mentions of both terms lead only to the
  <em>
   Mouthwire
  </em>
  article (or to secondary references to that article), which is not surprising since
  <em>
   Mouthwire

  is a satirical news site that features the following disclaimer:
