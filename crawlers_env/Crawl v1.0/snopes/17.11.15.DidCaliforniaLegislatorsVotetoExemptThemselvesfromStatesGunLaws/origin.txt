  The California State Senate agrees with Charlie Rangel that they “deserve” to own guns but the citizens do not! Every year they pass more and more gun control laws and NONE of them apply to themselves!

  They voted 28-8 to exempt themselves from the gun-control laws that apply to the rest of the California.
