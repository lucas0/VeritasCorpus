  The controversial fatal police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte, North Carolina on 20 September 2016 has once again set off a national debate about the treatment of minorities by the police and has sparked widespread outrage, touching off numerous protests and demonstrations in the streets of Charlotte.

  And once again, the Charlotte protests have touched off rumors that such demonstrations are primarily composed of “outside agitators” and “criminals” hailing from other areas (with the implication that the bulk of the protesters were brought to Charlotte from other states by a furtively-run group and/or were paid to take part in demonstrations there):

  But it wasn’t true, as widely reported, that 70% of the protesters arrested in Charlotte had out-of-state IDs.  That claim was based on a

   remark

  made  by Todd Walther, the spokesman for the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Fraternal Order of Police, during an interview with CNN host Erin Burnett:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I’m not saying all the people, but we’ve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can about say probably 70 percent of those had out-of-state IDs. They’re not coming from Charlotte.
