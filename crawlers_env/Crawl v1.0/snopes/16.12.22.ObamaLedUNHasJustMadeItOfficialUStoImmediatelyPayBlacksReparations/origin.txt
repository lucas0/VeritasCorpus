  A United Nations panel in Geneva wants the United States to pay African Americans reparations for slavery.

 <p>
  Sure, right after African Americans pay for burning down Los Angeles, Ferguson, and whatever other cities they destroyed.
 </p>
 <p>
  And right after that happens, let’s find all the African Americans who are over 151 years old, which means they were probably slaves before 1865, and send them a check if there’s any difference left over after they pay for rioted cities to be fixed.

  Sounds just about as dumb as a doorknob, right?
