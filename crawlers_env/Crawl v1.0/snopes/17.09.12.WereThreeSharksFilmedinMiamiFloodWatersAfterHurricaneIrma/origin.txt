  In the wake of Irma, many parts of Miami were so badly flooded that some of the ocean’s residents are now swimming up and down the city’s streets. Among them is none other than the infamous shark. If you thought you only had to worry about sharks while chillin’ at the beach, you might want to think again.

  Most of us would be running in the opposite direction if we saw a bunch of sharks swimming around town. However, this brave soul decided to head outside and record the moment. Seriously though, it looks like something straight out of a scary movie — and we all know that scary movies usually don’t end well.

  If you’re in Miami, be careful. If you’re not — now certainly isn’t the best time to plan a trip.
