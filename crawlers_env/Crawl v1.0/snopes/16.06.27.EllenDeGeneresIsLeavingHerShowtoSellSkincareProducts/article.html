  In June 2016, a web site mimicking
  <em>
   Woman’s Health
  </em>
  magazine published an advertisement disguised as a news article reporting that comedienne Ellen DeGeneres would be leaving her popular daytime television talk show to sell skin care products:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Ellen Degeneres recently announced she will be leaving
   <em>
    The Ellen Show
   </em>
   in November to promote a new skincare line that was recently voted #1 by Dermatologists. The 57-year-old, who now appears to be aging backwards, says, “I went through a complete transformation with two of the best skincare products on the market called Encante Anti-Aging Serum and Encante Eye Wrinkle Reduction.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Although the advertisement was hosted by the
  <em>
   YourHealthyLiving.co
  </em>
  domain, its text appeared under a
  <em>
   Women’s Health
  </em>
  banner, making it appear to readers that the magazine’s web site had vetted and reported a story containing that information:
