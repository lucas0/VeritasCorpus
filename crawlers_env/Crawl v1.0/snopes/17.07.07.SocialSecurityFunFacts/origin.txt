  Social Security Fun Facts:
 </p>
 <p>
  * Social Security and Medicare are paid for with a separate tax. They add NOTHING to the national debt.
 </p>
 <p>
  * Social Security has a $2.5 trillion SURPLUS.
 </p>
 <p>
  * Congress has “borrowed” trillions from Social Security to pay for government spending.
 </p>
 <p>
  So when the GOP says we need to cut Social Security in order to balance the federal budget… they’re lying.
