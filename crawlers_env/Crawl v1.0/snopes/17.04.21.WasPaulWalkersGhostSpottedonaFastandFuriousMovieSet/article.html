  Walker was one of the central figures of the
  <i>
  </i>
  series
  <i>
  </i>
  until he and friend Roger Rodas
  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/01/paul-walker-dies-car-crash" target="_blank">
   died
  </a>
  in a November 2013 car crash in Santa Clarita
  <i>
  </i>
  during the filming of
  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2820852/" target="_blank">
   <em>
    Furious 7
   </em>
  </a>
  .
  <em>
  </em>
  In order to finish the movie, producers brought in Walker’s
  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/15/showbiz/fast-furious-walker-brothers/" target="_blank">
   brothers
  </a>
  , Caleb and Cody Walker, to stand in for the deceased actor in a few scenes:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Paul Walker’s brothers are helping “fill in small gaps” in “Fast &amp; Furious 7” action sequences not finished before the actor’s death, producers said Tuesday.
  </p>
  <p>
   Walker died in a fiery car crash during a Thanksgiving break in filming last November, forcing a halt to production.

  The “ghost” image was taken on the set of
  <em>
   Furious 7
  </em>
