  In February 2014, social media users began sharing an Empire Sports article reporting that the Colorado Rockies baseball team planned to offering marijuana edibles (like pot brownies) Coors Field concession stands during the upcoming (i.e., 2016) season:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Sources are reporting that Major League Baseball’s Colorado Rockies plan to sell food items which contain marijuana at concession stands during games next season.
  </p>
  <p>
   The first item on the list? Pot Brownies.
  </p>
  <p>
   An official within the Rockies organization stated that the Rockies organization has given the green light to concession stands selling marijuana brownies.
  </p>
  <p>
   High ranking officials in the Rockies organization say they are thrilled at the new menu item since they note that it will bring in tens of thousands of dollars per month.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The claim wasn’t totally implausible on its face, as Colorado was one of four states — along with Alaska, Oregon, and Washington — that had legalized recreational use of marijuana (although Colorado law didn’t permit the consumption of pot “openly and publicly,” which would tend to blunt the appeal of selling marijuana at large sporting events).

  In fact, this story was totally false, a fabrication promulgated by the Empire Sports fake news site, which has long published sensational yet fake stories to garner social media shares.
