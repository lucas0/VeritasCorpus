  An image purportedly showing an anti-fascist (antifa) protestor hitting a police officer was circulated on social media shortly after a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, left one woman dead and dozens injured on 12 August 2017. The photograph was frequently

   accompanied

   This is not a genuine photograph of an antifa protestor striking a police officer. This image was digitally manipulated to add the antifa logo to an unrelated photograph.

  The real image was taken in Athens, Greece in December 2009 during a

   demonstration

  on the one-year anniversary of the death of Alexandros Grigoropoulos, a 15-year-old who was killed by a police officer. Photographer Milos Bicanski took the photograph, which is available on

  The protester’s jacket in the original image was blank. The antifa logo was digitally added to this image, which was then reshared as if it depicted a recent incident in an attempt to show that “both sides” contributed to the violence in Charlottesville:

   Some Republican lawmakers also chastised Trump’s response in implicit and explicit terms. “Mr. President—we must call evil by its name,” Colorado Senator Cory Gardner wrote on Twitter. “These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism.” Florida Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen said “there are no other ‘sides’ to hatred and bigotry.” Florida Senator Marco Rubio also noted it would be “very important for the nation to hear [President Trump] describe events in #Charlottesville for what they are, a terror attack by [white supremacists].”
