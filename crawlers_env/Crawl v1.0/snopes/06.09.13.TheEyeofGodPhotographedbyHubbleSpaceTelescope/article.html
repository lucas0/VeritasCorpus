  The Helix Nebula does not naturally appear with the colors shown above; however, the tinting of the image is artificial.  The picture’s “Eye of God” appellation is a title coined by an admirer of the photograph due to the nebula’s resemblance to a human eye, not something designated by NASA, and the nebula is also visible all the time, not merely “once in 3000 years.”
