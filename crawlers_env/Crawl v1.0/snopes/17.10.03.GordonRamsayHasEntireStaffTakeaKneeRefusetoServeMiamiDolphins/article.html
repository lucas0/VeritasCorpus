  Gordon Ramsay aimed his notoriously biting rhetoric — typically reserved for fumbling new chefs — at Miami Dolphins players who had hoped to dine at one of his restaurants:

    Gordon Ramsay Has His Entire Staff Take A Knee-Refuses To Serve Miami Dolphins Players
   </strong>
  </p>

   Four Miami Dolphins showed up at Gordon Ramsay’s Soho Social Gastropub for a bite to eat after their horrible performance and disrespect for our flag and our country.

  The item caused a stir on social media due to a raging debate over professional football players “taking a knee” during the national anthem to protest police brutality and Ramsay’s well-known sharp tongue.
