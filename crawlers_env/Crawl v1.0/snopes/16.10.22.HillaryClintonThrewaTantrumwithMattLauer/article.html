  with  have been circulating since the Democratic presidential nominee participated in that forum, which aired on 7 September 2016. While these rumors do seem to be rooted in a little truth — the Clinton campaign was not happy with the questions Lauer asked (or didn’t ask) during the event &amp;mdash claims that Clinton threw a “hissy fit” are unfounded.

  The web site Victurus Libertas was the first to promulgate this rumor, publishing an article entitled “Temper! Temper! Hillary Goes on Rampage for Over An Hour — Throwing Glass at Staffer’s Head.” Although Victurus Libertas linked to credible reports from

   And Politico‘s headlines read:  “Liberals Lash Out at Lauer, NBC“.  It seems to me, no one is “lashing out” but Hillary.

   Hillary’s meltdown included
