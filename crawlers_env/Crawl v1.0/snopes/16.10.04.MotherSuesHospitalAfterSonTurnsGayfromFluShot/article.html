  On 26 September 2015, the World News Daily Report web site published an
  <a href="http://archive.is/fwDgF/image" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  (later
  <a href="http://archive.is/hBXh3/image" target="_blank">
   aggregated
  </a>
  by fellow fake news outlet That Viral Feed) claiming a woman had sued a hospital because she believed a flu shot had “turned” her son gay:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Andrea Benenacci, the mother of a 16-year-old teenager who recently received a flu shot at San Francisco General Hospital, is suing the hospital after she noticed extreme changes in her son’s sexual preferences.
  </p>
  <p>
   The single mother of two blames the hospital for giving her son a vaccine shot which allegedly has made him queer.
  </p>
  <p>
   “My son was perfectly normal before the shot” she told reporters.
  </p>
  <p>
   Medical specialist Frank Weishberg claims he has observed a progression in similar claims in the past decade.
  </p>
  <p>
   “In my 40 years of research on male health relating to problems of the male reproductive system, I have been witness to at least a hundred similar cases only in the past decade, with a large amount in the San Francisco Bay area, which is extremely atypical,” he admits.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The article and its claims were purely fabricated. World News Daily Report is a fake news site whose
  <em>
   modus operandi
  </em>
  involves snatching unrelated pictures and attaching them to wild falsehoods and garnering social media shares via clickbait content. The site’s disclaimer clearly states that WNDR’s content is completely false:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   WNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website — even those based on real people — are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.
