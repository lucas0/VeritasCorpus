  On 18 April 2017, the web site How Africa
  <a href="http://archive.is/JUBwt" target="_blank">
   reported
  </a>
  that a writer named Louri Michaelevitch, who purportedly claimed to be Russian President Vladimir Putin’s lover, was found dead in an apartment in Zurich, Switzerland.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Writer, Louri Michaelevitch, a former personnal assistant of the Russian President, was found dead last monday in his swiss appartment after some of the neighbors complained about the smell emanating from the residence.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to the city’s police departmnent, many clues collected on the site suggest that he might have been the victim of an elaborate murder plot [sic]…
  </p>
  <p>
   …The victim had attracted a lot of attention from the Russian government and media in 2011 when he had written a book entitled “
   <em>
    Я был любовник Путина
   </em>
   ” (“
   <em>
    I was Putin’s Lover
   </em>
   “), which was taken off the shelves before the official release, after a presidential decree. A warrant demanding the arrest of the author was also issued across Russia, leading him to file a demand of political asylum from the helvetic state.
