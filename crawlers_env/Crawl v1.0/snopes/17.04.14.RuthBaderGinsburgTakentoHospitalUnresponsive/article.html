   Just days after having a nominee sworn into the highest court in the land, President Trump may get another chance. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, at 84-years-old, has been rushed to George Washington Hospital in what paramedics referred to as an “unresponsive” state.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to Fox News, Ginsburg was in her home early Wednesday morning when she slipped into unconsciousness. Her bodyguard found her and called 911. The responding paramedics arrived in under 4 minutes and had her at the hospital within 10, but so far, reports are saying she has yet to be revived.
