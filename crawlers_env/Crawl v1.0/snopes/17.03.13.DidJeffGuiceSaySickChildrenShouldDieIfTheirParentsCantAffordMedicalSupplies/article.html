  On 29 June 2016, the web site DCPols published an
  <a href="https://archive.is/YWTGu" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  (which they
  <a href="https://archive.is/riEWg" target="_blank">
   republished
  </a>
  as USPOLN in March 2017) about Mississippi legislator Jeff Guice, who supposedly expressed disdain for the plight of children whose parents cannot afford their medical care:

  The statement reproduced above was never uttered by Guice.

 <p>
  Both DCPols and USPOLN are “hybrid” web sites that publish stories containing a mixture of fact and fiction. In this case, the factual part of the article was based on a real
  <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2016/06/28/rep-mom-buy-your-own-meds/86464972/" target="_blank">
   comment
  </a>
  Guice made in June 2016 in reply to a mother who had asked for help in navigating the system Medicaid:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A state representative has apologized to the mother of a diabetic child who reached out to him asking for help navigating Medicaid.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nicole Nichols sent an email to each state representative, asking for help in obtaining her diabetic daughter’s insulin pump supplies.
  </p>
  <p>
   State Rep. Jeffrey Guice, R-Ocean Springs, responded, “I am sorry for your problem. Have you thought about buying the supplies with money that you earn?”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Although this comment (“I am sorry for your problem. Have you thought about buying the supplies with money that you earn?”) was real, DCPols employed a more sensational (and completely fabricated) quote for their article’s headline.
 </p>
 <p>
  Guice later
  <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2016/06/30/after-uproar-beleaguered-lawmaker-meets-with-mom-of-diabetic-child/" target="_blank">
   apologized
  </a>
  for his genuine remark:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “I realize my remarks to Mrs. Nichols were completely insensitive and out of line,” Guice said in an emailed statement. ” I am sorry and deeply regret my reply. I know nothing about her and her family and replied in knee-jerk fashion. I’d like to think the people of Mississippi and my constituents know that I”m willing to help where I am able.”
