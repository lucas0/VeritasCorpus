  In 1921, Johnny Gruelle’s 8-yr old daughter was vaccinated in school without her parents’ permission. Between the time she became ill from the vaccination and her death a few months later, her body was completely limp, like a rag doll. It was this sick vaccine-injured child that inspired Gruelle to create the Raggedy Ann doll.
