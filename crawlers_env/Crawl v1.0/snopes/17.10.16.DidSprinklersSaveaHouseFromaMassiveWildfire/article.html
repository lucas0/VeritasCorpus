   Four Kansas Army National Guard Black Hawk helicopters continue helping with fire suppression in Reno County, Kansas, on March 7. On March 6 more than 33,000 gallons of water were dropped on the fire.

   I just came across this online, it’s my house!!! I honestly feel like we have our silly cows to thank! We have had our sprinklers running overtime for several weeks because the cows love eating our lawn and since we haven’t fixed the fence yet we figured with the nice weather we may as well try to grow them grass while they’re in there!

  Although Tajchman may have left her sprinklers running during the wildfire, that was not the only source of water protecting her home. Dough Schmitt, the assistant fire chief of the Rile County Fire District, also

     I am the assistant fire chief for Riley County Fire District #1 in Manhattan Kansas. I am very proud of my firefighters who stood strong as the fire raced up to them while they were protecting this house. They first checked the house to make sure nobody was still home then they soaked the house and the detached garage behind the house that isn’t surrounded by green grass. They left as the fire raced by heading to the next house they could find.

   “During that 15 minutes, God blessed us in the form of two Riley County firemen who showed up, made sure no one was in the home and then proceeded to soak everything they could in more water.

   “Just as they ran out of water, the fire reached our back shed and they had to leave,” she wrote. “Upon reaching the end of our driveway, they set a back-burn in an attempt to stop the fire, which was successful for five minutes before jumping the road north of us.”
