  Hollywood’s elite just got together to pat themselves and the back and scold the rest of American for electing Donald Trump. But legendary actor Denzel Washington had a harsh dose of reality for his more entitled colleagues.
 </p>
 <p>
  People like Meryl Streep and Jimmy Fallon like to see themselves as the pinnacle of our society. But Washington said they’re wrong. It’s average Americans who make America great.
 </p>
 <p>
  The same average Americans who voted for Donald Trump because they are sick and tired of the elitist attitude of people like Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Meryl Streep, etc.
 </p>
 <p>
  At a roundtable discussion with other actors, Washington told his Hollywood colleagues to get off their high horses.
 </p>
 <p>
  “…people say: ‘Oh, the difficulty of making a movie.’ I’m like, listen, send your son to Iraq — that’s difficult. It’s just a movie. It’s like, relax. I don’t play that precious nonsense.”
