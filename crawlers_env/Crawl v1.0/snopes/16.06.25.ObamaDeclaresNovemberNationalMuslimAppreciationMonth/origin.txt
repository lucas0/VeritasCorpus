  President Barack Obama held a press conference to announce that he is declaring the month of November ‘National Muslim Appreciation Month’.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Muslim community deserves our full acceptance and respect,” Obama told reporters. “We have killed millions of Muslims overseas since the

   September 11th
  </nobr>
  attacks. They are not all bad. In fact most of them are good. So from now on, November will be a month to celebrate the Muslim community, the Sunnah and the Quran.”
