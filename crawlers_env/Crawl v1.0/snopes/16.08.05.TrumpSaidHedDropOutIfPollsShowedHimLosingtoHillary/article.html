   speculation

  in early August 2016 about the possibility that beleaguered GOP nominee Donald Trump might drop out of the presidential race (and what would happen if he did), the image displayed above hit Facebook.   That image inaccurately implied that Donald Trump had recently proclaimed during an appearance on the
  <em>

  </em>
  public affairs program that he would “drop out of the race before November” if “it’s apparent in the polls that I’m going to lose to Hillary [Clinton].”

 <blockquote>

   <em>
    CHUCK TODD: You said something the other day that caught me off-guard. You said you’re not a masochist. And if you start falling in the poll you’ll go back to your business. What does that mean? Are you not in this for the long haul?
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   DONALD TRUMP: If I was dropping in the polls where I saw that I wasn’t gonna win, why would I continue?  I believe in polls. How many elections do you see where the polls were wrong? Not that many. Okay. You see ’em, but not that many. If I were doing poorly, if I saw myself going down, if you would stop calling me ’cause you no longer have any interest in Trump because “he has no chance,” I’d go back to my business. I have no problem with that.
