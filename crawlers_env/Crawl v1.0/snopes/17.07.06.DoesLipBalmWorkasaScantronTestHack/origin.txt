  I am writing to ask about a rumor that I’ve heard since probably elementary school. In California, every student must take a standardized test every year of school. In 8th grade, a rumor spread across our school that if you applied chapstick to your answer sheet (which were supposed to be bubbled in with #2 pencil) that all the answers would be marked as correct. My boyfriend said that he heard the rumor from classmates at his school as well. Can this be true?

  Around my high school, the popular theory was that if you put chapstick down the scoring area (where the computer marks the wrong questions with red lines) that the computer would score the test as perfect. I never attempted this, but as far as I could figure out, if you filled in the box at the top of the test labled ‘key’, the computer would assume that your test was the teachers key. Too bad for all the people behind you, though.

  You know how when you take a test you have to use one of those scantron things? Well, the scantrons are very sensitive. Just a smudge can turn a right answer into a wrong one and (supposedly) a wrong one into a right one.

  There’s these little black dashes next to each ABCDE/FGHIJ and, if you put lip balm (vaseline, chapstick, whatever) on each dash (running your greased finger down the side of the scantron) you’ll mess up the scantron and each of your answers will be marked right.
