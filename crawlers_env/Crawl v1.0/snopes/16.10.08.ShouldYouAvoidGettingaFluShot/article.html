  Every flu season sees an increase in viral web stories making largely unsubstantiated allegations about the health risks of the flu shot that include claims about their scary-sounding ingredients, connections to a variety of diseases (including Alzheimer’s), and their supposed lack of efficacy in general:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The pharmaceutical industry, medical experts and the mainstream media are candid in telling us that flu vaccines contain strains of the flu virus. What they are less likely to reveal though is the long list of other ingredients that come with the vaccine. It is now a known fact that flu vaccines contain mercury, a heavy metal known to be hazardous for human health. Mercury toxicity can cause depression, memory loss, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory problems, ADD, oral health problems, digestive imbalances and other serious health issues.

  Flu shots work by introducing dead (inactivated) strains of influenza virus, which trigger your immune system to create antibodies to fight those strains. These antibodies make your body more prepared to fight if should it be exposed to an active strain in the future. Because the strains are inactive, any sickness you develop after the shot is not caused by influenza,
  <a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/10-flu-myths" target="_blank">
   according
  </a>
  to the Harvard Medical School:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The vaccine is made from an inactivated virus that can’t transmit infection. So people who get sick after receiving a flu vaccination were going to get sick anyway. It takes a week or two to get protection from the vaccine. But people assume that because they got sick after getting the vaccine, the shot caused their illness.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  It is, of course, possible that feelings of sickness come from some of the
  <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm#flu" target="_blank">
   side effects

  Many anti-vaccine articles parrot the claim that “51 studies involving 260,000 children showed no benefit compared to a placebo for children under the age of two”. This stems from a
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18425905" target="_blank">
   2008 meta-analysis
  </a>
  that did indeed conclude that there is less efficacy for children under the age of two, something the CDC already
  <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/vaccineeffect.htm#howeffectivechild" target="_blank">
   recognizes
  </a>
  on their website. However, of the 51 studies analyzed and the 260,000 observations those studies included, only one study (at the time) was performed on children below the age of two using inactive strains (the kind found in flu shots). A later

   study
  </a>
  in 2011 that reviewed over 5,000 research articles concluded that flu shots “consistently show highest efficacy in young children (aged 6 months to 7 years),” categorically rejecting the claim that there is a lack of “real evidence” that “young children” benefit from the shot.

   Guillain-Barré Syndrome
  </a>
  —a terrifying disease that causes nerve damage and sometimes paralysis. A widely cited study on a population of individuals who received the H1N1 vaccine in 1976 showed an increased risk of contracting this disease — whose cause is unknown — compared to those who did not receive the vaccine:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Institute of Medicine (IOM) conducted a scientific review of this issue in 2003 and found that people who received the 1976 swine influenza vaccine had an increased risk for developing GBS. The increased risk was approximately one additional case of GBS for every 100,000 people who got the swine flu vaccine. Scientists have several theories about the cause, but the exact reason for this link remains unknown.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The link between GBS and flu vaccination in other years is unclear, and if there is any risk for GBS after seasonal flu vaccines it is very small, about one in a million. Studies suggest that it is more likely that a person will get GBS after getting the flu than after vaccination. It is important to keep in mind that severe illness and death are associated with flu, and getting vaccinated is the best way to prevent flu infection and its complications.
 </p>
 <p>
  This topic has been heavily researched for decades, and no specific consensus regarding the link or mechanism behind the flu virus and the disease has been established. What has been established, however, is how small the risk is relative to the risks of contracting complications from flu itself. A 2013
  <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099%2813%2970104-X/abstract" target="_blank">

  in
  <em>
   The Lancet
  </em>
  stated that:
 </p>
 <blockquote>

   The relative and attributable risks of Guillain-Barré syndrome after seasonal influenza vaccination are lower than those after influenza illness. Patients considering immunisation should be fully informed of the risks of Guillain-Barré syndrome from both influenza vaccines and influenza illness.

  We, of course, are not healthcare providers and cannot make any medical decisions for you. The purpose of this post is to correct misinformation on the Internet, and there are few topics that lend themselves to as much misinformation as vaccines. All healthcare decisions, however, should be made between you and your doctor.
