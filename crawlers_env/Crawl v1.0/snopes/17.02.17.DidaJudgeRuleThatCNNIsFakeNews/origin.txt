  BREAKING: Federal Judge Just Officially Ruled CNN Is FAKE NEWS And Forces SHOCKING Punishment On Them!
 </p>
 <p>
  During his first press conference after winning the presidency, Donald Trump got in a notable spat with CNN’s White House correspondent Jim Acosta. He refused to take a question from him, then pointed at him and told him “you are fake news,” shutting him down before The Donald took somebody else’s question.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Mr. President that’s not appropriate” Acosta could be heard complaining — but according to a Federal judge, it’s quite the appropriate assessment. In fact, it’ll even hold up in a court of law!
 </p>
 <p>
  For some background, Davide Carbone, who was the former CEO of St. Mary’s Medical Center in West Palm Beach filed a defamation lawsuit against CNN after they aired a “series of false and defamatory news reports” about his hospital. Among the claims were that the infant mortality rate at the hospital was twice the national average, clearly implying some wrongdoing. Even more shocking, CNN’s report said the overall mortality rate was three times the national average … According to Mr. Carbone, that CNN “intentionally manipulated statistics to bolster their report.” He also claims that CNN had plenty of positive information about the hospital available they could’ve included in their report that they didn’t address so that they could sensationalize.

 <p>
  CNN is more than just fake news. They’re biased, sensationalist propaganda — AND fake. And a federal judge just confirmed it.
