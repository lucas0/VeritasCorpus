  A girl with Down syndrome, got up during a regular papal service &amp; went toward [Pope Francis.] Security men quickly moved in [to] take her back to her mom. The Pope stopped them &amp; said to her “come sit next to me.” She then sat down near him and he continued his homily, holding her hands.
