  Rep. Luis Gutiérrez turned and left the State of the Union address Tuesday, just as Republicans broke into a “USA” chant. President Donald Trump had just finished mentioning the Statue of Freedom atop the Capitol building, which he then called a “monument to the American people.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In that section of remarks, Trump also praised veterans in wars from the Revolution, through World War II and today, mentioning sites like Saratoga, N.Y., Yorktown, V.A. and the Pacific theater.

  As half of the gallery broke into a “USA” chant, Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) could be seen exiting his aisle seat and walking out of the chamber.
