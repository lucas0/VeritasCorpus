  We have had a problem with our drain. Started with the upstairs kitchen sinks. My plunger cleared it for a few days, then back the water came. My daughter Tracy removed the pipes under the sinks and used a “snake” … There was something there and she got it dislodged. In the end, Alan traced the blockage to the washing machine. We had to get a plumber. I am shocked with what he told us. After I write this I will post a photograph.

  He asked what I used for washing my clothes. I told him wash pods. He said to stop immediately. It affects your dishwashers too. He said he has had to clear loads of drains because of them. You will see in the photo how the gel has cemented so hard, he could not even drill it out. Just a warning folks…..
