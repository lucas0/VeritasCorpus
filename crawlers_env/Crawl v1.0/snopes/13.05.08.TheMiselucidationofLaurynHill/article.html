  In 1996 a caller to the Howard Stern show claimed Lauryn Hill of The Fugees made anti-white statements during an MTV interview, to the effect of proclaiming she’d rather see her child starve than have a white kid buy her album.  Circulated rumors about the inflammatory comment Hill supposedly made varied from telling to telling, including statements such as:

     “If I’d known white people were going to buy my last album, I never would have recorded it.”
    </li>

  </ul>

  <li>
   “I would rather have my children starve than have white people buy my albums.”
  </li>
 </p>
 <p>
  <li>
   “I would rather die than have a white person buy one of my albums.”
  </li>

   When asked on MTV about their feelings on having the number one album in the nation, The Fugees said they’d “rather see babies starve and die than have white kids” buy their album.
