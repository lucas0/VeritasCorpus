  On 19 March 2016, satire web site
  <em>
   Empire News
  </em>
  reported that a family had been killed by neglecting to close their car’s sunroof before going through a carwash:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   <strong>
    DARWIN, Mississippi
   </strong>
   – A family of three died yesterday after inadvertently leaving their sunroof open when going through an automated carwash. Mary and Roger Jones, both 32, and their daughter, Julie, 11, were all killed after the car filled with water.
  </p>
  <p>
   “It’s a tragic, horrible thing,” said carwash owner Joe Goldsmith. “Thing is, we have signs everywhere reminding people to close their windows. The water comes fast and furious, and it’s dangerous to have windows open. This is the first time in my 40 years as a carwash owner that something like this has happened, though.”

  This story is a fabrication.

  It would be very difficult to drown in a carwash, even if the sunroof was inadvertently left open.  According to a 2002

   report
  </a>
  by the International Carwash Association, even the most enthusiastic washer only uses about 110 gallons over the course of several minutes, but the average water consumption is around 43 gallons per vehicle — about as much water as a very small
