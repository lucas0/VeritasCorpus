  During the third and final presidential debate on 19 October 2016, social media users began tweeting up a storm claiming Hillary Clinton “leaked” classified information by revealing details about the United States’ nuclear response protocols, specifically that the timeframe between a presidential order and a launch of nuclear weapons was four minutes:

  The exchange in question occurred during a debate over diplomatic relations with Russia and allegations that the Russian government had attempted to interfere in the 2016 election. Moderator Chris Wallace
  <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/19/the-final-trump-clinton-debate-transcript-annotated/" target="_blank">
   asked
  </a>
  Donald Trump whether he “condemn[ed] any interference by Russia in the American election,” to which Trump answered in the affirmative. The discussion then turned to nuclear weapons (at the 33-minute mark in the clip below), a subject which Hillary Clinton contended showed her opponent to be unsuitable for the presidency:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   CLINTON: I — I find it ironic that he’s raising nuclear weapons. This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons. He’s…
  </p>
  <p>
   TRUMP: Wrong.
  </p>
  <p>
   CLINTON: … advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia. He said, well, if we have them, why don’t we use them, which I think is terrifying … But here’s the deal. The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
   <strong>
    There’s about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
   </strong>
   And that’s why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.
