   A homeless black woman reveals that she has been living in Trump Tower for eight years with the blessings of the Donald himself.
  </br>
 </p>
 <p>
  Filming from her hotel window, the woman says she originally snuck in the building before becoming a squatter in one of the empty rooms. Police arrived the next day and told the woman to leave or she’d be arrested.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When I told them I would not go, they contacted Mr. Trump over the phone and he came down here. Instead of evicting me off the property, he said that I can stay and it’s been eight years I’ve been here,” the woman reveals.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Not only did he not evict me off the property, he made sure that I ate three meals a day by room service and that I get a delivery of fresh flowers every week,” she adds
 </p>
 <p>
  The African-American woman expresses her displeasure at the characterization of Trump as a “bad guy”.
 </p>
 <p>
  “If it weren’t for him I’d be homeless – I’d be dead right now, I’d be in the street,” she says, adding that Trump hasn’t asked her to pay a dime.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Donald Trump is not a bad guy, he’s a wonderful wonderful man, and everything I’m telling you today is true,” she concludes.
