  Guess Which State Just BANNED VALENTINES DAY Because It ‘OFFENDS MUSLIMS’ … SERIOUSLY
 </p>
 <p>
  WTF?! SINCE WHEN DID AMERICA BECOME FILLED WITH THE MOST VILE OPPRESSIVE ASS BACKWARDS PUSSIES ON THE FACE OF GOD’S GREEN EARTH? THIS IS STARTING TO MAKE ME FURIOUS. AMERICANS NEED TO GET THEIR HEADS OUT OF THEIR ASSES AND THEIR KIDS OUT OF GOVERNMENT RUN SCHOOLS BEFORE THEIR CHILDREN ARE TURNED INTO SHEEP.

  The Principal of Bruce Vento Elementary School in St. Maul, Minnesota just sent a letter to parents noting that celebrations of Valentine’s Day are banned.

 <p>
  Why? Because it, along with other “dominant holidays,” are offensive to Muslims! … The principal went on to explain the holiday is cancelled as it violates some students’ religious beliefs. This is a reference to Muslims are not allowed to celebrate it. The romantic holiday is outlawed throughout every Islamic nation … Schools are never this sensitive to the needs of Christian students, but liberal school administrators will stop at nothing to appease Muslims. This is outrageous!
