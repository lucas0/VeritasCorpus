  On 4 May 2016, the entertainment web site
  <em>
   The Good Lord Above
  </em>
  published a fake news article reporting that Ted Cruz went on a Twitter rant blaming God for his failed presidential campaign:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   There was a time when Ted Cruz thought he had a chance to become president. That time is over. Cruz quit the presidential race on Tuesday night. On Wednesday morning, Cruz took to his Twitter account and had a meltdown of epic proportions.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The above-quoted article also included doctored Tweets showing Ted Cruz’ alleged Twitter rant:

  The above-displayed tweets were not posted on Ted Cruz’ official Twitter account. They were created for a fake news article published by the entertainment web site
  <em>
   The Good Lord Above.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Shortly after Cruz announced that he was suspending his campaign, he posted a thank you
  <a href="https://www.tedcruz.org/thank-you-cruzcrew/" target="_blank">
   message
  </a>
  to the #CruzCrew on his web site:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Thank you to the more than 317,000 of you who signed up to volunteer with this campaign — who made hundreds of thousands of phone calls, knocked on tens of thousands of doors, and spread the word to everyone you know in person and online. Together we assembled a grassroots army unlike anything seen in modern times.

  <em>

  is a humor site that makes its theme clear in its “About” page:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   God made the world. Then he flooded it. Then God went to sleep for 2000 years or so. Anyway, eventually God woke up and felt pretty bad for what he’d done in the past. In 2011, after years of therapy, God started his
   <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheGoodLordAbove" target="_blank">
    Divine God Facebook Page
   </a>
   to restore his good name. In his infinite wisdom, in 2015 God launched this Holy Website, TheGoodLordAbove.com.

  <p>
   TheGoodLordAbove provides news coverage of everything God does. As God created the universe, this covers everything in the known universe and all parallel universes. It’s all fair game.
