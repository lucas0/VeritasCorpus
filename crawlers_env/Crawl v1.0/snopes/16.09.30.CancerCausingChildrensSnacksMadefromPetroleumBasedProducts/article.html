  The first issue with the post is use of the term “petroleum-based”, which is simultaneously broad and misleading. The compounds Wolfe implicates are, technically speaking, petrochemical derivatives whose building blocks include one or more of the six basic organic
  <a href="https://www.afpm.org/petrochemicals/" target="_blank">
   chemicals
  </a>
  extracted from oil or natural gas. These chemicals are necessary for most procedures involving synthetic chemistry with organic compounds. so by Wolfe’s definition nearly every organic chemical you run into on a daily basis is “petroleum-based”.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each of Wolfe’s assertions should be analyzed on its own merits, but it is worth noting that dosage is also important when it comes to the safety of any chemical. Most of the laboratory studies showing deleterious effects potentially attributed to these additives are based on absurdly high amounts of substances that could not legally found in, or practically ingested through the consumption of, food products.

  to the NIH Toxicology Data Network, it has indeed been linked to tumors, vision loss, liver enlargement, convulsions, and paralysis in laboratory animals.

 <p>
  <strong>
   What’s left out:
  </strong>
  While there have, in fact, been animal studies that report harmful effects after large doses of TBHQ, as well as a single report of vision disturbance in humans after chronic exposure to the chemical, the totality of the research on the topic provides a more complex view of the problem. Numerous studies, which the NIH Toxicology Data Network also lists, have provided data that contradict those scarier-sounding studies. The long-term health effects in humans exposed to high doses of TBQH is not a settled issue, but the long-term effects of humans exposed to it in doses legally allowed by

   European
  </a>
  regulatory agencies is settled — it is considered, in their eyes, safe for human consumption.
 </p>
 <p>
  The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was asked to re-evaluate this conclusion in 2004. After reviewing all the available literature on the topic, they
  <a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/84" target="_blank">
   <span class="s2">
    concluded
   </span>
  </a>
  that TBHQ is “not carcinogenic and that further genotoxicity studies are unnecessary.”

  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What’s True:
  </strong>
  The EU has banned Red 3 for use only as a hair dye, but this was the result of a lack of properly filed paperwork. According to the EFSA
  <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/docs/sccs_o_030.pdf" target="_blank">
   report
  </a>
  on Red 3 as a cosmetic product, its ban as a hair dye came about “because a safety dossier supporting its use was not provided under the European Hair Dye

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What’s False:
  </strong>
  Any connection to cancer and tumors stems from a study on rats which scientists later
  <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/12961638%23section=Toxicity" target="_blank">
   determined
  </a>
  to be a poor analogy for comparison to consumption by humans. Both the EU and the United States consider the chemical to be non-carcinogenic and free of risk at legally allowable levels.

 <p>
  <strong>
   What’s True:
  </strong>
  Wolfe does not explicitly state what harm methyl benzoate may cause, but the NIH does consider it “mildly toxic” when ingested in high concentrations, and it is present in cheese flavoring. This is not surprising, as it is a
  <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf60216a037" target="_blank">

  compound in many cheeses.

   What’s False:

  From a strictly nomenclatural standpoint, there is no such thing as “ethyl methylphenidate,” and the top references to it on Google search link to cloned versions of Wolfe’s assertion:

  Giving Wolfe the benefit of the doubt, we’d guess it is possible he meant either Methylphenidate (the ADHD drug

  ) or Ethylphenidate (an

  <a href="https://www.med.illinois.edu/m2/pathology/TAReviews/neoplasia.php" target="_blank">

 <p>
  The claims made in Wolfe’s post stem from a highly selective, lazy, and filtered reading of decades of complex and involved research, a majority of which was never performed on humans. In those few studies that showed negative effects, dosing was much higher than would be encountered in any food including children’s snacks.

 <p>
  If a chemical considered damaging at higher doses but safe at lower doses concerns you, consider kale — a vegetable that, in Wolfe’s words, would allow kids to safely “taste the rainbow”. It
