  One could almost say it’s a rule. As a matter of fact, you know something? I’m just going to go out there and say it: it’s a law. And though I know it’s not really a law, I’m going to make sure to make it one. Because, it’s not about who the president is; the guy’s in there only temporarily. It’s about the structure, the space, the history within it and, ultimately, the honor of being inside a place where so many decisions took place; decisions that shaped the world as we know it. Ugh, I’m getting goosebumps just thinking about it. I can’t even begin to describe how I felt when I visited it for the first time. The Warriors don’t realize it yet, but they’re looking at this all wrong. That’s exactly why I plan to do everything in my power to make sure Golden State is prohibited from winning the championship, formally speaking, unless they agree to come and celebrate in the White House.
