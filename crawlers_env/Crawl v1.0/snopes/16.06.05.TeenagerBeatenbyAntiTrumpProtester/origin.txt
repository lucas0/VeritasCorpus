 <p>
  What if this was your daughter?
  <br>
   Not a word from San Jose Mayor
   <br/>
   not a word from Obama
   <br/>
   not a word from Hillary
   <br/>
   not a word from Bernie
  </br>
 </p>
 <p>
  The only word was from Trump Condemning this, the San Jose Mayor justified the beatings and the police watched on and did nothing.
  <br/>
  If we donâ€™t Vote Trump in this Country will be a 3rd world Hellhole
