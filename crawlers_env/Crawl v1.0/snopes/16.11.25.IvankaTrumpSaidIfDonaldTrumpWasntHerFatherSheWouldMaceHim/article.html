  on Twitter that said that Ivanka Trump had once said that if Donald Trump wasn’t her father, she would want to spray him with

   The tweet was picked up by a variety of outlets, which shared it along with the claim that Ivanka Trump had made the remark during an appearance on
   <em>
    The View
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
   </em>
   shortly after Donald Trump famously
   <a href="http://www.snopes.com/donald-trump-date-daughter/" target="_blank">
    said
   </a>
   that he would date her if she weren’t his daughter:

  This video is real: President-elect Donald Trump really did joke about dating his own daughter during an appearance on
  <em>
   The View.
  </em>
  However, the clip does not feature his daughter’s purported response.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kendizor evidently found Ivanka’s alleged “mace” quote in the “Quotables” section of the
  <em>
   <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/" target="_blank">
    Chicago Tribune
   </a>
   .
  </em>
  The screen shot she shared was real, and was
  <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-08-24/news/0608240028_1_donald-trump-ivanka-trump-prophet-muhammad" target="_blank">
   published
  </a>
  by the newspaper in August 2006:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “If he wasn’t my father, I would spray him with Mace.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Ivanka Trump, 24, the daughter of Donald Trump, on her father complimenting her figure on a talk show and then joking that he would date her if he weren’t her father.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The same quote, along with the same attribution, also appeared in an end-of-the-year quiz by the
  <em>
   <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1537765/The-Holiday-Quiz-2006.html" target="_blank">
    Telegraph
   </a>
   .

  However,

   </a>
   )
  </em>
  never mentioned this particular quote.
 </p>
 <p>
  So where did it come from?
 </p>
 <p>
  The earliest version of this quote we could uncover was published on 17 March 2006, in the “News For Dumb Guys”
  <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/219506214/" target="_blank">
   section
  </a>
  — a weekly feature in Louisiana’s Shreveport
  <em>
   <a href="http://www.shreveporttimes.com/" target="_blank">
    Times
   </a>
  </em>
  — where it was attributed to comedian Conan O’Brien:
 </p>
 <blockquote>

   “While appearing on
   <em>
    The View
   </em>
   , Donald Trump said if his 25-year-old daughter Ivanka wasn’t his child, he would date her. Meanwhile, Ivanka said if Donald Trump wasn’t her father, she would mace him.”

  Jordan Schlansky, a former producer for
  <em>

  <em>

  </em>
  and current producer of
  <em>

  confirmed in an email that the above-displayed quote originated with Conan O’Brien:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I can confirm your quote below was a monologue joke from the “Late Night with Conan O’Brien” episode originally broadcast on March 7, 2006. Unfortunately, we can’t provide footage as that program is controlled by NBC Universal.
