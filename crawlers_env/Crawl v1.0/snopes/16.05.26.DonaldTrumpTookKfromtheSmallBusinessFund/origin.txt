  <strong>
   Donald Trump’s building at 40 Wall Street is located a mile from ground zero
  </strong>
  , yet Donald Trump joined in with fellow bigwigs to take that money from the mouths of business owners, some of whom had to close shop completely after the attack. Trump granted the money after he was able to prove that the business located at 40 Wall Street only had $26 in its bank account.

 <p>
  How exactly Trump’s financially failing business qualified for a $150,000 grant from Empire State Development Corporation,
  <strong>
   money meant for buildings that were structurally damaged during the attack
  </strong>
  , is beyond most people with functioning brains, but that is exactly what he did. The federal government is responsible for allowing the large corporations to take advantage of the funds set up for Americans who actually needed it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The real clincher, is the fact that the business located at 40 Wall Street brings in an annual revenue of $8 million, which clearly disqualifies if from being considered a small business. Also,
  <strong>
   even if there were structural damages to the building, Donald Trump could have easily afforded to fix it himself
  </strong>
  . Trump, however, decided to take advantage of the federal government’s generosity.
