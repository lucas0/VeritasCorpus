  circulated on social media suggesting the latter had died in a car crash:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   US actor and comedian Eddie Murphy, who starred in over 50 films, has been killed in a car crash in California.
  </p>
  <p>
   Murphy, 54, was a passenger in a Porsche sports car driven by a friend – who also died – when it crashed north of Los Angeles.
  </p>
  <p>
   Murphy was said to be attending a charity event at the time.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s department said the crash happened in the community of Valencia.
  </p>
  <p>
   “He was a passenger in a friend’s car, in which both lost their lives. We… are stunned and saddened beyond belief by this news.”
  </p>
