    Open a window and leave the room for 15 minutes or more.
   </li>
   <br/>

  </li>
  <br/>
  <li>
   Use sticky tape, such as duct tape, to pick up any remaining small glass fragments and powder.

   Disposal of Clean-up Materials

 </p>
 <p>

   Wash your hands after disposing of the jars or plastic bags containing clean-up materials.
  </li>
  <br/>

   Check with your local or state government about disposal requirements in your specific area. Some states prohibit such trash disposal and require that broken and unbroken mercury-containing bulbs be taken to a local recycling center.
  </li>
