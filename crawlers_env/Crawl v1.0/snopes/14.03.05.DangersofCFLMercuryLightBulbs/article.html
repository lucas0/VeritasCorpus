  Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs), whose use is estimated to result in a $47 savings in energy costs over the life of each bulb versus incandescents, have had their critics. They take longer to switch on. Regular CFLs won’t work with dimmer switches. They can interfere with radios, cordless phones, and remote controls.
 </p>
 <p>
  They also contain mercury, a fact that causes no small amount of concern in light of how dangerous that substance is. Yet the amount housed in each bulb is very small, about 4 or 5 milligrams, which in volume is about the size of the period at the end of a sentence. (By comparison, old-style mercury thermometers contain about
  <nobr>
   500 milligrams of mercury, an amount equal to the mercury found in 125 CFL bulbs.)  And, provided the bulbs aren’t broken open, none of that leaches into the home.

  Like batteries, used CFLs need to be disposed at a toxic waste depot rather than tossed out with the ordinary household trash. Because mercury is cumulative, this poisonous element would add up if all the spent bulbs went into a landfill. Instead, the mercury in dead bulbs is reclaimed at such depots and recycled.

  As to the potential for harm posed by mercury escaping from broken bulbs,

  the King County Hazardous Waste Program: “Crushing and breaking fluorescent lamps release mercury vapor and mercury-containing phosphor powder. These can be difficult to contain.” Yet the recommended clean-up process does not involve calling in a HazMat team. Says the EPA in its advisory about dealing with

   <strong>
    Before Clean-up: Ventilate the Room
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   <li>
    Have people and pets leave the room, and don’t let anyone walk through the breakage area on their way out.
   </li>
   <br>
    <li>
     Open a window and leave the room for 15 minutes or more.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>
     Shut off the central forced-air heating/air conditioning system, if you have one.
    </li>
   </br>
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Clean-Up Steps for Hard Surfaces
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   <li>
    Carefully scoop up glass fragments and powder using stiff paper or cardboard and place them in a glass jar with metal lid (such as a canning jar) or in a sealed plastic bag.
   </li>
   <br/>
   <li>
    Use sticky tape, such as duct tape, to pick up any remaining small glass fragments and powder.
   </li>
   <br/>
   <li>
    Wipe the area clean with damp paper towels or disposable wet wipes and place them in the glass jar or plastic bag.
   </li>
   <br/>
   <li>
    Do not use a vacuum or broom to clean up the broken bulb on hard surfaces.
   </li>

    Clean-up Steps for Carpeting or Rug
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   <li>
    Carefully pick up glass fragments and place them in a glass jar with metal lid (such as a canning jar) or in a sealed plastic bag.
   </li>
   <br/>
   <li>
    Use sticky tape, such as duct tape, to pick up any remaining small glass fragments and powder.
   </li>
   <br/>
   <li>
    If vacuuming is needed after all visible materials are removed, vacuum the area where the bulb was broken.
   </li>
   <br/>
   <li>
    Remove the vacuum bag (or empty and wipe the canister), and put the bag or vacuum debris in a sealed plastic bag.
   </li>
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Disposal of Clean-up Materials
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   <li>
    Immediately place all cleanup materials outside the building in a trash container or outdoor protected area for the next normal trash.
   </li>
   <br/>
   <li>
    Wash your hands after disposing of the jars or plastic bags containing clean-up materials.
   </li>
   <br/>
   <li>
    Check with your local or state government about disposal requirements in your specific area. Some states prohibit such trash disposal and require that broken and unbroken mercury-containing bulbs be taken to a local recycling center.
   </li>
  </p>

    Future Cleaning of Carpeting or Rug: Ventilate the Room During and After Vacuuming
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   <li>
    The next several times you vacuum, shut off the central forced-air heating/air conditioning system and open a window prior to vacuuming.
   </li>
   <br/>
   <li>
    Keep the central heating/air conditioning system shut off and the window open for at least 15 minutes after vacuuming is completed.
   </li>
