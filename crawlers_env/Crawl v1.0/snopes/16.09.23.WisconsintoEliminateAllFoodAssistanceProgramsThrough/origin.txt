 <p>
  Due to a state budget shortfall, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker announced Wednesday that all FoodShare/Quest/SNAP/EBT (food stamps) benefits will end beginning on December 1st, 2016. The benefits are expected to be reinstated sometime in 2019, at which point the deficit will be resolved.
 </p>
 <p>
  In order to meet the needs of the new budget and not increase the stateâ€™s deficit of $45 billion, Walker has chosen to temporarily put an end to the FoodShare program.
 </p>
 <p>
  State Representative Brian Dunford (R) says while cuts to the program are difficult to make, he believes they are necessary to move Wisconsin forward.
