  Van Halen was the first band to take huge productions into tertiary, third-level markets. We’d pull up with nine eighteen-wheeler trucks, full of gear, where the standard was three trucks, max. And there were many, many technical
  <nobr>
   errors — whether
  </nobr>
  it was the girders couldn’t support the weight, or the flooring would sink in, or the doors weren’t big enough to move the gear through.

 <p>
  The contract rider read like a version of the Chinese Yellow Pages because there was so much equipment, and so many human beings to make it function. So just as a little test, in the technical aspect of the rider, it would say
  <nobr>
   “Article 148:
  </nobr>
  There will be fifteen amperage voltage sockets at twenty-foot spaces, evenly, providing nineteen
  <nobr>
   amperes …”
  </nobr>
  This kind of thing. And article
  <nobr>
   number 126,
  </nobr>
  in the middle of nowhere, was: “There will be no brown M&amp;M’s in the backstage area, upon pain of forfeiture of the show, with full compensation.”
 </p>
 <p>
  So, when I would walk backstage, if I saw a brown M&amp;M in that
  <nobr>
   bowl …
  </nobr>
  well, line-check the entire production. Guaranteed you’re going to arrive at a technical error.  They didn’t read the contract. Guaranteed you’d run into a problem. Sometimes it would threaten to just destroy the whole show. Something like, literally, life-threatening.
