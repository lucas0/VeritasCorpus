  Although [Johnson &amp; Johnson] claims that the amount of formaldehyde isn’t large enough to be detrimental to humans — even infant humans — the fact is that it still has allowed this chemical for as long as they have been making the No More Tears shampoo.
 </p>
 <p>
  But now, the company has announced the removal of formaldehyde from that shampoo and they are removing it from one hundred other products that they manufacture as well.

 <p>
  It could be seen as a sign of good intentions that the company is removing it from their products.
  <strong>
   But the real question is: why hasn’t it been removed before now?
