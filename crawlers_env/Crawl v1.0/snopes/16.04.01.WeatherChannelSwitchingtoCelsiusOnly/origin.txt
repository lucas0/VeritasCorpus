  After much debate, The Weather Channel is proud to announce that, effective immediately, the television network will be using the Celsius scale to report temperatures. This move comes at the expense of the Fahrenheit scale, which has been the exclusive temperature scale for The Weather Channel since its inception in 1982.

  “While we always want to be inclusive of the global world that we all live in these days, the simple truth is that, after much internal deliberation, we’ve determined that it just doesn’t make sense for water to freeze at 32°. People understand something freezing at 0°,” the spokesperson said.
