  A photograph showing a little girl sleeping within the lines of a chalk drawing of a woman is frequently passed around social media along with the claim that the pictured child is an Iraqi orphan and that chalk drawing is a depiction of her absent mother.  Although the photograph is real, the backstory that typically accompanies it is not.

  page to tell the true story behind the picture:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   This little girl is my cousin and she actually fell asleep on the asphalt just outside my house. She must have played for some time and just lied to rest and fell asleep.

  <p>
   I used a chair to stand on in order to take this shot. There is no orphanage involved and no tragic story behind this. I took this opportunity to be creative.

   It is a style of photography

  In fact, Bisheh is a big fan of this type of photography. The picture seen here was included in an
