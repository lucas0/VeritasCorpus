   Fidel Castro
  </a>
  on 25 November 2016 was one of the year’s many history-making events, occurring just weeks after

  Immediately after Castro died, a joke emerged that Castro had once quipped he would not die until “America was destroyed.” Later versions of the  were typically accompanied by a photograph of a smiling or laughing Trump.
