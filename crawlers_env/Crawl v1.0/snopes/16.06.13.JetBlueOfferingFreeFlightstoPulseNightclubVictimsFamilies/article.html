  and Twitter, where users both lauded the airline and encouraged viewers to share the information.
 </p>
 <p>
  We contacted JetBlue to inquire whether there was any truth to the rumor, and a representative for the airline told us:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   JetBlue is providing free seats on its available flights to/from Orlando for immediate family and domestic partners of victims who were killed or injured. Those family members and domestic partners requiring travel assistance can contact 1-800-JETBLUE for details.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  We were unable to find any mention of JetBlue’s initiative on the company’s Facebook, Twitter, or other social media platforms, but the company did directly provide the statement reproduced above to us indicating that some family members and domestic partners of the victims were eligible for travel assistance to and from Orlando following the Pulse nightclub tragedy. Moreover, the company forwarded us a link to a

  that provided details about the assistance the airline was offering to loved ones and domestic partners:
