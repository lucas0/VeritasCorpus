<blockquote>
 <p>
  During a recent press conference, a reporter with MSNBC hollered from the press corps, “Where is President Trump hiding his tax returns?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, astutely responded, “We’ve found a very secure place and I’m certain they won’t be found.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “And just where is that?”, said the reporter, sarcastically.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mrs. Sanders grinned and said, “They are underneath Obama’s college records, his passport application, his immigration status as a student, his funding sources to pay for college, his college records, and his Selective Service registration.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Next question?”
