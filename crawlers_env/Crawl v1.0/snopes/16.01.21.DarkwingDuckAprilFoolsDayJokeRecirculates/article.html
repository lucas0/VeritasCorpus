  On 21 January 2016, several web sites such as
  <em>
   <a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/after-25-years-disney-resurrects-darkwing-duck-1754229903" target="_blank">
    i09
   </a>
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   <a href="http://www.tvovermind.com/tv-news/darkwing-duck-headed-back-to-tv-in-2018" target="_blank">
    TV Overmind
   </a>
  </em>
  published articles claiming that the popular animated show
  <em>
   Darkwing Duck
  </em>
  would return to television in 2018:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   <em>
    Darkwing Duck
   </em>
   , which aired its last new episode in 1992, will return to TV in 2018. Plenty of time to get dangerous.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  While both
  <em>
   i09
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   TV Overmind
  </em>
  are both credible news sources, the story about
  <em>
   Darkwing Duck’s
  </em>
  revival originated with an April Fool’s
  <a href="http://nerdreactor.com/2015/04/01/disney-announces-new-darkwing-duck-coming-to-disney-xd/" target="_blank">
   joke
  </a>
  that was published by
  <em>
   Nerd Reactor
  </em>
  on 1 April 2015.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shortly after realizing that they had been duped, i09
  <em>
  </em>
  published a retraction:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   It looks like we, and TV Overmind, were tricked by an old April Fool’s post dated April 2, 2015. Sorry about that.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  As of January 2016, Disney has not announced any plans to revive the
  <em>
   Darkwing Duck
  </em>
  television show.
