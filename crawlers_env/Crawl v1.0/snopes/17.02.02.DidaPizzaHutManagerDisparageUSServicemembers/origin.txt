  A Huntsville Pizza Hut is reeling after they say a man made up a negative story, posted it to Facebook, and got thousands of shares. Pizza Hut managers are reacting and hoping to clear the air about the “fabricated incident.”

  Pizza Hut customer Caleb Lee made a Facebook post claiming he asked for a military discount. When he didn’t see it on his receipt, he asked to speak to a store manager, according to his Facebook post. The post went on to say that the “corporate manager” cursed at him and told him to leave his store.

  Store managers at the 4802 University Dr. NW location said the military man’s story was made up.

 <p>
  According to a statement the franchise released, they tried to reach out to Lee on social media, but he removed himself from Facebook.

  Pizza Hut’s statement says that managers conducted a thorough investigation. The store reviewed surveillance footage and confirmed the individual was a customer that day and did ask for a military discount. Pizza Hut states the rest of Lee’s story doesn’t check out: They said he wasn’t approached by anybody else and he left the establishment.
