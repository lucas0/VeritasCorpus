  On 22 August 2017, the Facebook page “Geology Wonders” posted an

    image

  that appears to show a massive seahorse fossil exposed on a boulder with the caption “giant fossil of a seahorse.”
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  While breathtaking, the picture is fake and its premise is scientifically implausible. The image won

  The notion that such a large, well-preserved seahorse fossil would be found anywhere on Earth is unlikely. In fact, seahorse fossils are remarkably rare, and have so far been found only in

   <span class="s1">
    two locations

  : the Tunjice Hills in Slovenia, and in a single fossil bed in Northeastern Italy. Both of these fossil beds preserve seahorses that are similar in size and shape to the

  alive today, which range from .6 to 14 inches long.

   <span class="s1">
    estimate

  that the largest seahorse fossil from Slovenia, if it had preserved the complete body, would have about 9 centimeters long — far smaller than human-sized seahorse allegedly preserved in the boulder. As such, we rank this claim as false.
