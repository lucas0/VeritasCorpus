  Tamara Rubin, the director and producer of the forthcoming documentary, MisLEAD: America’s Secret Epidemic is also the director of the Lead Safe America Foundation. She frequently tests items that are brought into their headquarters in Portland, OR. In the Facebook post that ignited a firestorm, she shows an image of a 3M Lead Check Swab after being used to test the outside of a Pyrex bowl.

  The milk glass interiors, classic to most vintage Pyrex and Anchor Hocking pieces, commonly contain lead as well. The lead in milk glass is probably inert, however, no lab tests are currently being done on these vintage pieces. It is also probable that using the glass with highly acidic foods or using glass that is scratched may release some of the lead contained in the glass. The problem is that you won’t know once you’ve reached the point where your bowl or dish is leaching lead.
