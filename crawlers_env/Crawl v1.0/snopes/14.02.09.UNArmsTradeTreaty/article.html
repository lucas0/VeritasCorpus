  The concept of trying to crack down on the illicit trading of conventional arms through the development of an international agreement setting standards for legal arms trading has been in process in the United Nations (UN) since 2006, when the General Assembly passed a resolution titled “Toward an arms trade treaty” which called upon the UN secretary-general to survey member states on “the feasibility, scope and draft parameters for a comprehensive, legally binding instrument establishing common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms.”   The administration of President George W. Bush was opposed to such efforts, stating that they preferred national controls to international agreements, and in several votes on resolutions and procedures related to a UN arms trade treaty from 2006 through 2008 the United States either cast the lone dissenting vote or was one of a very small number of member nations voting in the negative.

  The administation of President Barack Obama has been more receptive to UN efforts to craft an international agreement on the small arms trade, however, as reported in the October 2009 Reuters news article cited in the example text reproduced above.  That month, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a statement proclaiming that “The United States is committed to actively pursuing a strong and robust treaty that contains the highest possible, legally binding standards for the international transfer of conventional weapons,” and the U.S. voted in favor of moving forward with plans for a 2012 UN conference on drafting an arms trade treaty.

  In March 2013 a finished version of the
  <a href="https://unoda-web.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/English7.pdf" target="_blank">
   Arms Trade Treaty
  </a>
  (ATT) was finally presented to the U.N. General Assembly, and that body approved the treaty by a vote 154 to 3 (with 23 abstentions) on 2 April 2013.  The U.S. was one of the member nations voting in the General Assembly to approve the treaty; only Iran, North Korea, and Syria voted against it.  The treaty was finally signed by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in September 2013, but the treaty still requires ratification by fifty U.N. signatories before it goes into effect (so far only seven nations have committed to that step), and it still requires approval by the U.S. Senate before the United States commits to its terms.

  The above-referenced piece of scarelore about the United States’ having already entered into a such a
  <nobr>
   treaty — one
  </nobr>
  which supposedly provides a “legal way around the
  <nobr>
   2nd Amendment”
  </nobr>
  and will result in a “complete ban on all weapons for US
  <nobr>
   citizens” — is
  </nobr>
  erroneous in all its particulars:
 </p>
 <p>
  <ul type="Disc">
   <br>
    <li>
     The Arms Trade Treaty has nothing to do with restricting the legal sale or ownership of guns within the United States.  The aim of the
     <nobr>
      U.N. Arms
     </nobr>
     Trade Treaty is to combat the illicit
     <u>
      international
     </u>
     trade of arms by “tightening regulation of, and setting international standards for, the import, export and transfer of conventional weapons” in order to “close gaps in existing regional and national arms export control systems that allow weapons to pass onto the illicit market”:
    </li>
   </br>
  </ul>
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Arms Trade Treaty obligates member states to monitor arms exports and ensure that weapons don’t cross existing arms embargoes or end up being used for human-rights abuses, including terrorism. Member states, with the assistance of the U.N., will put into place enforceable, standardized arms import and export regulations (much like those that already exist in the U.S.) and be expected to track the destination of exports to ensure they don’t end up in the wrong hands. Ideally, that means limiting the inflow of deadly weapons into places like Syria.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The text of the proposed treaty specifically “reaffirms the sovereign right and responsibility of any State to regulate and control transfers of conventional arms that take place exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own legal or constitutional systems,” so even if such a treaty came to pass, U.S. rights and laws regarding the sale and ownership of small arms would still apply within the United States.
 </p>
 <p>
  <li>
   The Obama administration has
   <a href="http://www.state.gov/t/isn/armstradetreaty/index.htm" target="_blank">
    stated
   </a>
   that mandatory conditions for U.S. approval of such an arms trade treaty include the following:
  </li>
 </p>
 <p>
  <ul type="Disc">
   <br/>
   <li>
    The Second Amendment to the Constitution must be upheld.
   </li>
  </ul>
 </p>
 <p>
  <li>
   There will be no restrictions on civilian possession or trade of firearms otherwise permitted by law or protected by the U.S. Constitution.
  </li>
 </p>
 <p>
  <li>
   There will be no dilution or diminishing of sovereign control over issues involving the private acquisition, ownership, or possession of firearms, which must remain matters of domestic law.
  </li>
 </p>
 <p>
  As the
  <em>
   Wall Street Journal
  </em>
  reported, the U.S. ‘voted in favor [of the treaty only] after the Obama Administration secured its key “red line” that the treaty would have no impact on the Second Amendment. The final draft specifies “non-intervention in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction” of signatories.’
