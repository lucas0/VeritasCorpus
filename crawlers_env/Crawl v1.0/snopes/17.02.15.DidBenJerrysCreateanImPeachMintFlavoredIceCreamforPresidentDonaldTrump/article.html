    released
   </a>
   politically-inspired ice cream flavors, and the company has
   <a href="http://www.benjerry.com/whats-new/2017/01/stand-up-stand-together" target="_blank">
    put out
   </a>
   several
   <a href="http://www.benjerry.com/whats-new/2016/trump-epa-appointment" target="_blank">
    statements
   </a>
   about Trump’s presidency. However, this particular ice cream does not appear in the company’s list of
   <a href="http://www.benjerry.com/flavors" target="_blank">
    flavors

   on its web site.
