  Gene had previous escaped [the draft] due to a knee injury incurred when he played football in his teens.  But the diagnosis of Osgood-Schlatters disease was remedied by rest and physiotherapy, so it was not long before he was
  <nobr>
   re-examined.
  </nobr>
  This time, he feigned madness, employing whatever drugs were at his disposal to enhance the desired effects.  “Gene was living with me at the time,” Clarke told me. “We did a programme and it was hard getting Gene out of the draft. They weren’t buying that bullshit about his leg. I kept him up for a week. Thanks to massive amounts of dexedrine he screwed up all the tests. They looked up his ass. It was seriously demeaning. But we were the best of brothers and I helped get him out.”

  “When I went in, it was major shit. I wore these stupid pants and sandals. I sat there cross-legged and suggested I had a problem. They were waiting for somebody to try and get out and their attitude was ‘You’re front line, dude.’ I got through the tests. There was a form with the question, ‘Are you a homosexual?’ I wrote ‘No!’, then changed it to ‘Yes’, then ‘No’ again, then crossed it out a few times. I knew all the answers and freaked out. I followed the yellow line and I had to take a piss. They give you this thing to carry and I threw it down on the floor and went over in the corner and took a piss. The guy said, ‘This is very
  <nobr>
   serious …
  </nobr>
  You can’t do that!’ I turned around and accidentally ended up pissing on him. Then somebody tried to take my stuff, so I jumped in and said, ‘Take your hands off my stuff or I’ll kill you. I’m serious’ I’d got my hands round this guy’s neck. Right away, they sent me to the psychiatrist’s office. They were looking at me thinking, ‘Is he for real or is he bullshitting us?’ There was one guy there with long hair who went to Vietnam, but I didn’t. You had to be good. The psychiatrist asked me, ‘Have you ever done it with a woman?’ I said, ‘No!’ He said, ‘Have you ever wanted to?’ I said, ‘No!’ He said, ‘Have you ever done it with a man?’ I said, ‘No!’ He was just looking at
  <nobr>
   me — that’s
  </nobr>
  all he was doing. Finally, he said, ‘Get the hell out of here.’ They ran me down the red line and booted my ass out of
  <nobr>
   there — ‘Get
  </nobr>
  out of here, you faggot bastard, schizoid homosexual, not fit for military service at any
  <nobr>
   time — 4-F.’
  </nobr>
  I ran out the door, jumped in my Porsche, beat it back to the beach and was laughing all the way. If you think I wanted to go to Vietnam, you were out of your mind. I was making too much goddamn money.”
