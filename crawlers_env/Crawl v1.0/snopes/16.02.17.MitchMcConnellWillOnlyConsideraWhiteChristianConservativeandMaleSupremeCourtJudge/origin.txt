  In a brief statement, McConnell outlined the party stance. “In an effort to work with the president and in the spirit of bi-partisanship, we are willing to consider Supreme Court nominees that meet the following criteria: They must be white, conservative, Christian and male. We will not consider anything else. We have enough liberal, ethnics and women on the bench. If the President is serious about what is best for our country he will to heed of our recommendation.”
