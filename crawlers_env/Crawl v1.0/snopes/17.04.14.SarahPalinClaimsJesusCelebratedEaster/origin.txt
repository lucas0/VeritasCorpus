  In an interview with
  <i>
   Fox and Friends
  </i>
  this morning, the former Alaska governor promoted her new book about the left’s “war on Christmas” and argued that all Christian holidays should return to the traditional versions practiced by Jesus.

 <p>
  “It makes me so gosh darn angry,” Palin explained. “The liberal left in this country has targeted Christian holidays and is trying to secularize them right out of existence.
 </p>
 <p>
  “When Jesus celebrated Easter with his disciples there were no Easter bunnies or egg hunts. There were no Easter sales at department stores or parades in the street. Easter was a special time of prayer and Christian activism.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Jesus would gather all the townspeople around and would listen to their stories about the meaning of Easter in their lives. Then he would teach them how to love one another, how to protest Roman abortion clinics and how to properly convert homosexuals.
