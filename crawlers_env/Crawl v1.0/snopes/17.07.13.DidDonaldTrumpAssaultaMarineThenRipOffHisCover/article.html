  , along with a claim that the Commander-in-Chief had first assaulted him — and that the footage had been aired on CNN.

  One of the most popular versions of the claim was posted to the “Women For Trump Movement II: #maga2018”

  An accompanying

  describes what happened when the Marine’s hat was blown off as he stood at the Marine One helicopter:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <div class="zn-body__paragraph speakable">
   While boarding Marine One at Joint Base Andrews on Saturday, Trump stopped to retrieve the Marine’s cover — the term used to describe the hat worn by the Marines — which had been blown off his head.
  </div>
  <div>
  </div>
  <div class="zn-body__paragraph speakable">
   While walking up to the helicopter, Trump noticed the cover on the ground in front of him, reached down to pick it up and returned it to the head of the Marine, who was standing at attention next to the helicopter.
