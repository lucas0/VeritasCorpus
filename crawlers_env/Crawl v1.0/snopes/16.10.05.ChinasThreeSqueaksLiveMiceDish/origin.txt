  This disgustingly weird trend involves eating newborn mice dipped in soy sauce. The dish is called Three Squeaks, which is derived from the sounds the mice made while being eaten. “The first squeak is when the mouse is picked up with the chopsticks. The second is when the mouse is dipped into the sauce. The third is when the mouse is placed into your mouth.”

  This disgustingly weird dish is becoming a trend right now in China, especially in Guangdong province. Someone even uploaded a video of him while eating baby mice on the online Chinese video network Miaopai. It has gathered millions of views ever since.
