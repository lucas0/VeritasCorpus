  A gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida on 14 February 2018, killing seventeen people — mostly teenaged students. Immediately, in what has become a deeply troubling (yet entirely predictable)

   Here’s the email. I asked for more information to back up the claim and was sent another email that linked to a YouTube conspiracy video.

   I was just made aware that my aide made an insensitive and inappropriate allegation about Parkland students today. I have spoken to him and placed him on leave until we determine an appropriate course of action. I do not share his opinion and he did so without my knowledge.

   I’ve been terminated from the State House. I made a mistake whereas I tried to inform a reporter of information relating to his story regarding a school shooting. This was not my responsibility. I meant no disrespect to the students or parents of Parkland.

    wrong dates
   </a>
   in search results, as a Google spokeswoman told us:
  </br>
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Listing the date and time for news stories is complicated, as there is no universal standard used. Sometimes, stories have no date and time on the webpage. Sometimes, a story may appear on a page that lists related stories, and they all have different dates and times shown. Sometimes a publisher might be in a different time zone and the date gets picked up incorrectly. All these things may cause us to occasionally list the wrong date. We’re looking at ways to improve.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Google’s public search liaison Danny Sullivan addressed the issue on Twitter, explaining why some of the article dates were misleading:
 </p>
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
  <p dir="ltr" lang="en">
   The time comes from this embedded in the story’s code:
   <br/>
   datetime=”2018-02-14T14:40:35+00:00″
   <br/>
   That means the story is as of 2:40pm UTC — IE Greenwich time, not Miami time. The publication likely forgot to set the time zone to Miami, mistakenly reporting it five hours early.

   The first is because we picked up the wrong date for a related article at the end. The others are going to be similar. We can get the wrong date for a variety of reasons.

  The “false flag” conspiracy theory is applied almost as a reflexive reaction to promote unfounded fears of a government takeover, which will be preceded by a forcible national gun grab (although there’s never any explanation offered for how a government entity might be clever enough to keep the same hoax with the same people going over and over again for years but too stupid to be able to orchestrate a full takeover).
