  Senior Advisor to the President, Anthony Scaramucci is no stranger to controversy. From the beginning of his career at Goldman Sachs to his recent successful selling of global investment firm Skybridge Capital, Scaramucci has been in the gilded spotlight. The spotlight that he is currently in may be more than he bargained for.

  Scaramucci’s wife, Deidre Ball, filed for divorce citing her husband’s “blind political ambition” as her main reason for leaving him. Scaramucci has hit back by posting nude pictures of Ball to his Twitter account earlier this evening, posting “Now everyone can see her ‘blind’ ambition.” The pictures show Ball completely nude in very suggestive poses, obviously meant to be kept private.
