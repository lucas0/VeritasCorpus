  On 10 October 2016, the Hillary Clinton shill site
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/tag/dailynewsbin/" target="_blank">

  published an
  <a href="http://archive.is/f9cYh" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  claiming that
  <em>
   Newsweek
  </em>
  magazine had uncovered “absolut[e] proof” WikiLeaks had published fabricated e-mails in their October 2016 “Podesta Emails” archive, maintaining that journalist Kurt Eichenwald had determined many of those documents were “phony”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Even as Hillary Clinton pulls further ahead in the 2016 Presidential race, those who dislike her have been holding their breath that international hacker terrorist group WikiLeaks would make good on its promise to unearth dirt that would damage Clinton.
   <strong>
    After a month of hyping up the supposed documents, it finally released them to relatively little fanfare on Friday. And now we know why they were released in the Friday night garbage chute: many of them are phony, and the hackers were looking to avoid media scrutiny — but Newsweek has managed to prove their inauthenticity anyway.
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   Even as Donald Trump obsessed during the second debate about the supposed internal emails from Hillary Clinton’s friend Sidney Blumenthal which showed him “admitting” that she had failed as Secretary of State, Newsweek reporter Kurt Eichenwald was in the process of figuring out that the key email in question didn’t really come from Blumenthal. How did Eichenwald figure it out? He realized that the email attributed to Blumenthal was actually something that he himself had written …
   <strong>
    This represents absolutely [sic] proof that WikiLeaks is in fact leaking phony “Hillary Clinton emails” in an attempt to make her look bad.
   </strong>
   Or as Eichenwald puts it, “WikiLeaks is compromised.”

  The article was based on a 10 October 2016

   piece
  </a>
  penned by Eichenwald which went viral and has since been significantly edited.
  <em>
   Daily News Bin
  </em>
  asserted that Eichenwald “proved” the inauthenticity of “Podesta Emails” in his article, but what his piece actually claimed was that the Russian news outlet
  <em>
   Sputnik
  </em>
  had (deliberately) misreported the content of a leaked e-mail, and that Donald Trump’s repetition of that misreporting
  <br>
   proved he was sourcing information fed to him by Russian propaganda outlets attempting to manipulate the 2016 election in Trumps’ favor.
  </br>
 </p>
 <p>
  What Eichenwald wrote was that a leaked e-mail showed that Clinton confidante Sidney Blumenthal had forwarded to Clinton campaign manager John Podesta a lengthy article he (i.e., Eichenwald) had written, but the Russian news outlet
  <em>
   Sputnik
  </em>
  misreported the nature of that e-mail and claimed that Blumenthal himself had penned the material he forwarded to Podesta:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   An email from Blumenthal — a confidant of Hillary Clinton and a man, second only to George Soros, at the center of conservative conspiracy theories — turned up in the recent document dump by WikiLeaks.
  </p>
  <p>
   The documents that WikiLeaks has unloaded recently have been emails out of the account of John Podesta, the chairman of Clinton’s election campaign. Almost as soon as the pilfered documents emerged,
   <em>
    Sputnik
   </em>
   was all over them and rapidly found (or probably already knew about before the WikiLeaks dump) a purportedly incriminating email from Blumenthal.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Russians were quoting two sentences from a 10,000-word piece I wrote for
   <em>
    Newsweek
   </em>
   , which Blumenthal had emailed to Podesta. There was no mistaking that Blumenthal was citing Newsweek — the magazine’s name and citations for photographs appeared throughout the attached article. In fact, the email was 75 pages long when printed out. The sentences quoted by the Russians were on page 19, following 22 different mentions that the words came from Newsweek.
  </p>
  <p>
   To understand the full importance of the false Blumenthal story — and how much Putin and his Kremlin cronies must have been dancing with delight — I have to quote the top few paragraphs:
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    In a major revelation from the second batch of WikiLeaks emails from Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta it was learned that Hillary’s top confidante Sidney Blumenthal believed that the investigation into Benghazi was legitimate because it was “preventable” and the result of State Department negligence.
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   In an email titled “The Truth” from Hillary’s top confidante Sidney Blumenthal, the adviser writing to undisclosed recipients said that “one important point that has been universally acknowledged by nine previous reports about Benghazi: The attack was almost certainly preventable” in what may turn out to be the big October surprise from the WikiLeaks release of emails from the account of Clinton Campaign Chair John Podesta.
