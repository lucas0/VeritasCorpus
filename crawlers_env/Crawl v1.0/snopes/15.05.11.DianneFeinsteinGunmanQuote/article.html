  In February 2013, web site
  <i>
   Palookaville Post
  </i>
  published an article (“Feinstein and Boxer Ask Californians to Lay Down Their Weapons During Statewide Manhunt”) containing an extraordinary claim about a statement purportedly made by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California. According to author “Jimmy Olsentwins,”
  <nobr>
   Sen. Feinstein
  </nobr>
  commented on the
  <nobr>
   then-current
  </nobr>
  standoff involving former police officer
  <a href="http://graphics.latimes.com/christopher-dorner-manhunt/#chapter-one" target="_blank">
   Christopher Dorner
  </a>
  by urging Californians to turn in their guns en masse:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Throughout the day, Senators Feinstein and Boxer made desperate pleas for their California constituents to turn in their guns and not confront the crazed gunman because this would be a perfect test of their anti-gun proposals.
  </p>
  <p>
   “The Senators feel the best course of action is to remove all weapons from law enforcement and private citizens so no one else gets hurt,” said a Senate communications intern. “When the gunman realizes that nobody else is armed, he will lay down his weapons and turn himself
   <nobr>
    in …
   </nobr>
   that’s just human nature.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Unfortunately for those who have since looked to determine the quote’s veracity, the
  <em>
   Palookaville Post
  </em>
  site is now defunct, and the original article is therefore offline (save for
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130210084023/http://www.palookavillepost.com/2013/02/07/feinstein-and-boxer-ask-californians-to-lay-down-their-weapons-during-statewide-manhunt/" target="_blank">

  versions).
 </p>
 <p>
  Suffice it to say the
  <em>
   Palookaville Post
  </em>
  was a satirical site that published fake news, one example of which was the
  <nobr>
   made-up
  </nobr>
  story about Senators Feinstein and Boxer referenced above.  Other examples of its work included articles claiming President Obama had granted himself a $100,000
  <nobr>
   <a href="/politics/satire/payraise.asp" target="pay">
    pay raise
   </a>
  </nobr>
  and an Oklahoma teacher had been fired for
  <a href="/politics/satire/oklahoma.asp" target="ok">
   praying
  </a>
  when a tornado hit her school.
 </p>
 <p>
  If nothing else, the name of the “reporter” bylined on the story should have given away its japing nature: “Jimmy Olsentwins” is a conflation of the name of the cub reporter who works at the fictional
  <em>
   Daily Planet
  </em>
  newspaper in Superman comics and the surname of actresses Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Fuller Olsen, collectively known as the Olsen Twins.
