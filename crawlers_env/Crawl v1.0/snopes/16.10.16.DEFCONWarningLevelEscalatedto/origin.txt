<blockquote>
 <p>
  At 9:43 PM Eastern US last night (Sunday, June 19) the Armed Forces of the United States were reportedly ordered to set condition “DEFCON 3.” This is an extraordinary development and signals serious trouble, LIKELY requiring an expedited military response.
 </p>
 <p>
  The defense readiness condition (DEFCON) is an alert state used by the United States Armed Forces.
 </p>
 <p>
  The DEFCON system was developed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) and unified and specified combatant commands. It prescribes five graduated levels of readiness (or states of alert) for the U.S. military. It increases in severity from DEFCON 5 (least severe) to DEFCON 1 (most severe) to match varying military situations.
 </p>
 <p>
  To understand the severity of DefCon 3, it would help to realize that on September 10, 2001, the US Military was at DefCon 5. When the attacks of September 11 took place, the US Military was upgraded only to DefCon 4.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the US to have implemented DefCon 3 at 9:43 PM EDT on a Sunday night, means something very big is taking place.
