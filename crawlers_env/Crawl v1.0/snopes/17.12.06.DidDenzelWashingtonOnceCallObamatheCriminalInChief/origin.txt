 <p>
  Former president Barack Obama ran the United States “
  <em>
   like a banana republic
  </em>
  ” as “
  <em>
   criminal-in-chief
  </em>
  ” and enriched himself and his cronies at the expense of the rest of the country, according to Denzel Washington.
 </p>
 <p>
  “
  <em>
   Federal debt skyrocketed under Obama. He was printing money by the end of his reign. This is unheard of in our history. He ran the country like a banana republic,
  </em>
  ” said Denzel Washington at a New York screening of his new film, the legal drama “Roman J. Israel, Esq.“
 </p>
 <p>
  Asked by a reporter whether his information about Obama was correct, Denzel Washington confirmed that it was “
  <em>
   absolutely correct
  </em>
  .” He also criticized mainstream media for attempting to turn Obama into a “
  <em>
   kind of idol
  </em>
  .”
