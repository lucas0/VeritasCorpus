  The pale-pink Emery dress, from the brand’s Pre-Fall 2017 collection, is covered in paillettes from its high neck to the mid-calf hem. Clusters of embroidered flowers are scattered throughout the ’40s-inspired silhouette. The style originally retailed for $5,500 at luxury retailer Browns, but is currently on sale for $2,201.26. (It’s sold out on Erdem’s website.)

  Though Erdem released the dress with a periwinkle-colored belt, Melania removed it for the New Year’s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago. The resulting look, then, was more ’80s than its original iteration. She finished the look off with pointed-toe stilettos in a matching shade of pink.
