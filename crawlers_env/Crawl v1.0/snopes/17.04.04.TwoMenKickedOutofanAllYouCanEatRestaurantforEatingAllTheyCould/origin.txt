  George Dalmon, a former rugby player, and his friend Andy Miles were banned from all-you-can-eat restaurant, Gobi, In Brighton, after the manager branded them “a couple of pigs”.
 </p>
 <p>
  The men would each eat five bowls of stir-fry during their regular meals at the Mongolian barbecue, which invites guests to create their own dishes from the buffet.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Mr Dalmon, 26, said the restaurant should honour its promotion. He said: “They’ve only got small bowls and you can’t get enough in there so we always go back for more.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We’ve been eating there for a couple of years then suddenly the owner came to our table in front of all the customers and went absolutely mental. He said we were a couple of pigs and we were banned for life. I couldn’t believe it.”
