  that a man had killed seven people with a chainsaw at a haunted house in

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A Los Angeles, California man is in custody, and
   <nobr>
    7 people
   </nobr>
   are dead after a tragic attack inside an East LA hunted house attraction over the weekend that was caught on surveillance video.
  </p>
  <p>
   A Hispanic male, 26-year-old Luis Ortega, entered the Texas Chainsaw Massacre House of Horrors on Friday’s opening night wielding a chainsaw.

  The article quoted people who had witnessed the attack and included surveillance footage of the incident taken from a security camera:

  While the video accompanying the article was real, it did not capture a man killing seven people with a chainsaw outside of a haunted house. Instead, the video showed an incident from February 2012 in which a man was kicked out of a pub in England. Dean Dinnen, 24, was booted from the Endyke Pub in Hull after he refused to put out a cigarette; the inebriated man then chased patrons with a gas powered chainsaw and injured one woman before patrons subdued him in the street.  Dinnen was

   sentenced
  </a>
  to three years in prison for his assault.

 <p>
  The video saw a surge in popularity after it was combined with a backstory about a man’s killing seven people at a haunted house with a chainsaw, but no such incident took place.  The story about the haunted house killings is fiction, and the video is an old one repurposed to lend it credence.
