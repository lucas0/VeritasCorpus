  In September 2016, social media users began sharing a video clip that was circulated with the claim that it depicted a NYPD officer named Frederick Soldaat raping a teenage girl who was being held in police custody.

   charged

  with raping a 15-year-old girl who had been taken to a police station temporarily to “cool down” following an altercation with her parents.  However, those events took place in Cape Town, South Africa, and not New York City:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The bail application of a policeman accused of raping a 15-year-old girl at the Montagu police station was postponed in the local magistrate’s court.
  </p>
  <p>
   Warrant Officer Frederick Soldaat’s lawyer asked that the matter be postponed to October 10 [2016] as they were still following up on certain aspects of the case.

  <p>
   The 47-year-old officer is accused of raping the girl on August 30, after she was taken to the police station to cool down following an altercation with her parents at home.
