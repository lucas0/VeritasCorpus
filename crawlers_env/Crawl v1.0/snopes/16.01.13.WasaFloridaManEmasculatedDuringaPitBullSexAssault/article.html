  <em>
   World News Daily Report
  </em>
  published an article reporting that a 37-year-old Florida man had suffered some very serious groin injuries after being bitten by a pit bull:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Jesus Ramon Sanchez, from the Little Havana neighborhood in Miami, was allegedly attempting to engage in sexual intercourse with a 4-year old male pit bull, when the dog defended itself by tearing off the man’s genitals with its teeth … According to witnesses, 4-year old Spanky, was playing with his owner in the park when Mister Sanchez grabbed him and attempted to rape him. The male pit bull violently resisted and severely injured its attacker’s legs, arms and groin.

   “The dog was just running around, playing with a ball, when the man came out of nowhere and tried to grab it,” says Dorothy Steinberg, a witness of the events. “The man had his pants down and was struggling with the dog. Everyone in the park was just stunned and nobody did anything, but the dog defended itself and bit back. In a matter of seconds, he grabbed the man’s genitals with its teeth and literally tore them apart.”

  The article included the photograph seen above, which purportedly depicted the unfortunate Sanchez after his canine sexual misadventure. However, the image neither featured the individual named in the article, nor was it related to any bestiality incidents. Its first appearance on the web occurred in
