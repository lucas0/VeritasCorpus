  This week’s issue of Newsweek quotes my report from B.F. Henry that there’s one good thing about the Beatles — “during the hour they were on Ed Sullivan’s show, there wasn’t a hubcap stolen in America.”

 <p>
  It is with heavy heart that I must inform Newsweek that this report was not true. Lawrence R. Fellenz of 307 E. Groveton St., Alexandria, had his car parked on church property during that hour — and all four of his hubcaps were stolen.

  The Washington Post regrets the error, and District Liner Fellenz regrets that somewhere in Alexandria there lives a hipster who is too poor to own a TV set.
