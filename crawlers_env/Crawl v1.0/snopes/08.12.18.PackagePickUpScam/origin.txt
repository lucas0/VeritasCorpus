  Dear Friend,
  <br/>
  Greetings to you &amp; your Family.
 </p>
 <p>
  I have been waiting for you since to contact me for your Confirmable Bank Draft of (750,000.00) United States Dollars, but I did not hear from you since that time, Then I went and deposited the Draft with FEDEX DELIVERY COURIER SERVICE in west Africa before I traveled out of the country for a short Course and I will not come back till next the year. What you have to do now is to contact the FEDEX DELIVERY COURIER SERVICE COMPANY as soon as possible to know when they will deliver your package to you because of the expiring date.
 </p>
 <p>
  For your information, I have paid for the delivering Charges, and Insurance fee. The only money you will send to the FEDEX COURIER SERVICE COMPANY for deliver your package direct to your postal Address in your country is ($150) only being their Security Keeping Fee of the Courier Company so far.
 </p>
 <p>
  Again, don’t be deceived by anybody to pay any other money except $150, I would have paid that but they said no because they don’t know when you will contact them and in case of demurrage. You have to contact the FedEx courier Service Company now for the delivery of your package with this information bellow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Email Address: fedexexppservice@live.com

  Finally, make sure that you reconfirm your Postal address and Direct telephone number to them again to avoid any mistake on the Delivery and Let me repeat once more, try to contact them as soon as you receive this mail to avoid any further delay and remember to pay them their Security Keeping fee of $150 for their immediate action. You should also let me know through email as soon as you receive your package. Note. The FEDEX DELIVERY COURIER SERVICE COMPANY doesn’t know the contents of the Box. I registered it as a Box of an African cloth. They don’t know that it contains money. This is to avoid them delaying with the Box. Don’t let them know what it contains. I am waiting for your urgent response. Please go ahead now and contact them immediately with information above.
