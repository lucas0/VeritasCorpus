  In April 2015, the quack web site Natural News rebeat the drum of a several-year-old contoversy by publishing a misleading
  <a href="http://archive.is/C9vqe/image" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  (which was republished by a number of other equally disreputable web sites) holding that major food companies such as Pepsico sell products “manufactured using the tissue of aborted human babies”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Every time you purchase mass-produced processed “food” from the likes of Kraft, PepsiCo, or Nestle, you’re choosing, whether you realize it or not, to feed your family not only genetically engineered poisons and chemical additives, but also various flavoring agents manufactured using the tissue of aborted human babies.
  </p>
  <p>
   It’s true: A company based out of California, known as Senomyx, is in the business of using aborted embryonic cells to test fake flavoring chemicals, both savory and sweet, which are then added to things like soft drinks, candy and cookies. And Senomyx has admittedly partnered with a number of major food manufacturers to lace its cannibalistic additives into all sorts of factory foods scarfed down by millions of American consumers every single day.

  In order to debunk that claim, we need first provide a couple of definitions:
