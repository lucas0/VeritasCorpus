  We started receiving the above-displayed photograph (of a woman and a man leading a horse and a large dog through a park-like area), without any accompanying explanation, in
  <nobr>
   March 2007.
  </nobr>
  A few weeks later, someone added text identifying the dog as “Hercules, the World’s Biggest Dog.”
 </p>
 <p>
  This information is accurate (in the sense that an English mastiff named
  <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0106/09/smn.03.html" target="_blank">
   Hercules
  </a>
  owned by a Massachusetts man was once recognized as the world’s heaviest dog), but it doesn’t have any connection to the dog shown in the image displayed above, which clearly does
  <u>
   not
  </u>
  match a newspaper photograph of the real Hercules (and his owner):

  (We note that the term “biggest dog” is somewhat ambiguous and is used here to mean “heaviest dog” rather than “tallest dog.”  Guinness currently assigns the latter title to

   Zeus

  , a Great Dane who measured

   44 in.

  and passed away in 2014.)

  An English mastiff named
  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/443886.stm" target="_blank">
   Kell
  </a>
  , described as “weighing
  <nobr>
   21 stone
  </nobr>
  <nobr>
   (294 lbs.),
  </nobr>
  taller than a Shetland pony, and more than six feet long,” was previously described as the “world’s heaviest dog,” but it’s unclear whether she was still alive at the time the “Hercules” photograph began circulating. (Different newspaper articles from 2001 referred to her as both living and dead, and we could find nothing but brief, indefinite mentions of her after early 2002.  If she were still alive, why she ceded the “world’s heaviest dog” title to Hercules would be puzzling, because news accounts generally listed her as being slightly heavier than Hercules.)

  Also, the dog pictured above looks to be a
  <a href="http://www.akc.org/breeds/neapolitan_mastiff/index.cfm" target="_blank">
   Neapolitan
  </a>
  mastiff rather than an English mastiff.   If so, the canine would appear to be either a digital manipulation or a freakishly large example of its breed, because adult Neapolitan mastiffs typically reach a height of
  <nobr>
   24-31 inches
  </nobr>
  at the shoulder.  (Contrast, for example, the above image with other
  <a href="http://www.neapolitan.org/html/history.html" target="_blank">
   photographs
  </a>
  demonstrating the size of Neapolitan mastiffs
  <a href="http://www.123freehost.co.uk/sites/cheeko2005/" target="_blank">
   relative
  </a>
  to people.  Adult Neapolitan mastiffs typically reach a height of
  <nobr>
   24-31 inches
  </nobr>
  at the shoulder.)
