  On 28 January 2016, the web site
  <em>
   The Third Spur
  </em>
  published an article reporting that Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump had proposed deporting all blonde, blue-eyed women from the United States:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump announced today his latest initiative to “Make America Great Again!”: Deport all women who have blonde hair and blue eyes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Speaking to a crowd of over 10,000, Trump declared: “Seriously, folks! We’re talking about these women, with their blonde hair and their blue eyes, and they’re biased — they’re twisted — the worst people our country has.”
  </p>
  <p>
   While there was initially no response from his audience (many of whom were looking at each other, waiting to see what the general reaction would be), the majority ultimately ended up erupting in thunderous applause, with a small rebel minority who began booing Trump’s remarks.
