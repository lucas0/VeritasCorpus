 <p>
  Store manager Imran Chunawala was stunned [by the reaction] because the holiday had nothing to do with 9/11.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then he realized what happened. Imam Ali died on the
  <nobr>
   21st day
  </nobr>
  of Ramadan in the year
  <nobr>
   661 AD.
  </nobr>
  It’s a somber and significant holy day for Muslims. This year it coincidentally fell on
  <nobr>
   September 11.
  </nobr>
 </p>
 <p>
  “We did not explain enough in the sign because that is the same sign we put up every year on this particular day for this particular reason,” said Chunawala.
 </p>
 <p>
  He apologized for the confusion and put up a new sign thoroughly explaining the martyr they were honoring died in
  <nobr>
   661 AD.
  </nobr>
 </p>
 <p>
  “If people thought that that’s what this was about, I apologize,” Chunawala said. “That was not what this was about. I’m clarifying once again and I seriously am sorry for any misunderstanding that this caused.”
