  Toward the tail end of August 2004, we began to find this quote among the morning’s e-mail as an increasing number of our readers thought to ask us about it. This simple-looking piece could be considered either true or false, depending on which of its versions and components the reader chooses to focus upon.

  T. Bubba Bechtol claims ownership of this quote, but he is not a Pensacola City Councilman (part-time or otherwise), nor even a real person. Rather, “T. Bubba” is the on-stage persona of James Terryl Bechtol, a comedian who has appeared more than one hundred times at the

   This is a tough one. I tell people all the time, that “I just repeat what I hear and see.” My type and style of comedy lends itself to telling others what I think is funny about current events, people and even other comedians. I don’t get angry when I hear someone, even other comedians “using my material”, I’m actually proud of it. That is uncommon among comedians. If I hear something funny that I think will make people laugh, I repeat it with my own twist of humor to make it new and interesting.
