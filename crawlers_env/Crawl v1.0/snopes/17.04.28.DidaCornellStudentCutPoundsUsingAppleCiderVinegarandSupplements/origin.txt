  Student from Cornell University Cuts 31lbs On University Budget!
 </p>
 <p>
  Amanda Haughman, a student at Cornell University, was able to drop 31lbs off her waist in 1 month without ever using a dime of her own money. Amanda is studying nutrition sciences at Cornell, and for a required research project Amanda thought it would be perfect to use university funds to find out how to ‘hack’ her weight loss. According to Amanda, “the most expensive piece of it all was actually finding what worked. But the actual solution only cost about $5.”

   “I had struggled with my weight my whole life. I tried things like Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig, which just didn’t work as good as they promised. I am a single Mom with a kid at home and I am also working towards my degree, so I don’t have any time to be at the gym. When I was assigned this big research project, I saw it as a perfect opportunity to get a deeper look at the natural weight loss opportunities that are out there, and that is when I found out about combining Refresh Garcinia Cambogia and apple cider vinegar. The best part of it all, I can tell that my daughter is proud of me.” – Amanda Haughman
