  In February 2018, Facebook users began encountering a post proclaiming that
  <em>
   Rocky
  </em>
  actor Sylvester Stallone had “died early this morning after his battle with prostate cancer.” The post was accompanied by photographs showing the actor seemingly in a sickly state, with thinning hair, a haggard face, and much reduced in weight:

  This images, however, stemmed from the actor’s role in the forthcoming film

   <em>
    Creed II

  , in which he portrays the famous Rocky Balboa character battling against cancer. The on-set photographs had previously caused

   consternation

  among some of Sly’s fans when they were posted online.

  Stallone himself tweeted about the rumor to reassure fans he was alive and well:

   Please ignore this stupidity… Alive and well and happy and healthy… Still punching!

  This celebrity death hoax echoed a September 2016 fraudulent message also spread via social media claiming that Stallone had been found dead at his home in Los Angeles:

  This web site spreads misinformation (almost always a death hoax) in an attempt to bait people into giving away their information. Here’s how the scam works: A salacious title (Sylvester Stallone found dead!) is posted to Facebook. Those interested in reading the article click the provided link, but before being redirected to the story they are greeted with a pop-up requesting permission to view their personal information:

  Sylvester Stallone is not dead. When we bypassed the above-displayed permission request, we were greeted with a story about the actor’s son, Sage, who
  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/30/sage-stallone-cause-of-death-heart-attack_n_1845156.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

  away in 2012.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be national news if Stallone really had passed away, yet news stories about him current in February 2018 reference his ongoing participation in the upcoming
  <em>
   Rocky
  </em>
  series spinoff sequel
