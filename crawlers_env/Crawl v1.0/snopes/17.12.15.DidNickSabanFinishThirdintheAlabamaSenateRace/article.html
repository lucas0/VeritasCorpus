  On the day of Alabama’s special Senate election, 12 December 2017, the satirical web site
  <em>
   The Daily Snark
  </em>
  <a href="http://dailysnark.com/nick-saban-came-3rd-place-alabama-senate-election-20k-votes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   reported
  </a>
  that a prominent sports figure in the state had received substantial support from voters on a sharply divided ballot that drew national attention. Republican Roy Moore faced allegations of child sexual abuse in weeks leading up to the race against Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor who went on to win the race by a narrow margin.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to the
  <em>
   Snark
  </em>
  ‘s story, another Alabaman was in the race:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Nick Saban, head coach for the University of Alabama football team received 20,500 write-in votes for the election to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions, yes, even despite losing the Iron Bowl.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The story is a fabrication. If the Daily Snark’s name was not enough of an indicator, the site contains this disclaimer:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Daily Snark is your sports, news, and entertainment satire website. We provide you with the latest breaking news, memes and videos!
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The story includes a
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRHVfIbeGpQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   video
  </a>
  the site claims was posted by residents who “paid for and ran ads to inform others” on how to write the coach in on their ballot; in fact, the video was put together by American Bridge 21st Century, a liberal super PAC.
 </p>
 <p>
  A spokesperson for the Alabama Secretary of State’s office told us that it has not verified if Saban actually received any write-in votes, though at least one voter, Greg Dobbins,
  <a href="https://twitter.com/SInow/status/940674561699471361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   told
  </a>
  MSNBC that he voted for him instead of Democratic candidate Doug Jones or his Republican opponent, Roy Moore.
 </p>
 <p>
  Overall, 22,780 write-in votes were

   reportedly
  </a>
  recorded during the election. While Jones won the election by 20,715 votes, Moore has refused to concede the election. Moore’s refusal to concede does not affect the outcome; it is merely a tradition of American political etiquette to assure smooth transition of power in a democracy.

   According
  </a>
  to Alabama law, though, write-in votes must be tallied if they outnumber the difference in vote totals between the top two candidates in non-municipal state elections. The spokesperson told us that a decision in that matter has not been made.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill has
  <a href="http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/12/roy_moore_recount_could_cost_1.html#incart_m-rpt-2" target="_blank">
   said
  </a>
  that the election results will be certified between 26 December 2017 and 3 January 2018. If Jones and Moore’s vote totals are separated by 0.5 percent or less at that point, it could lead to a recount.
