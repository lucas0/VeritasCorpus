  In early December 2015, the web site
  <em>
   CelebTriCity
  </em>
  published an article reporting that talk show host Oprah Winfrey was pregnant with her first child at the age of 61:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   AFTER SEEING MARK ZUCKERBEG AND HIS WIFE GO THROUGH THERE PREGNANCY IT JUST INSPIRED ME TO HAVE MY OWN BABY” — OPRAH
  </p>
  <p>
   Oprah Winfrey has more money ($3 Billion) than she will ever be able to spend in her lifetime, so choosing to have this child means her baby will be born a billionaire. She reportedly can’t stop crying tears of joy as this is the one thing she has always wanted since she lost her baby at 14.

  There is no truth to the above-quoted story.
  <em>
   CelebTriCity
  </em>
  is one of many fake news web sites currently operating on the Internet, and their disclaimer notes that
  <em>
   CelebTriCity
  </em>
  is “the most notorious entertainment website in the world” which publishes “shocking headlines” and a combination of “real &amp; satire news” in order to keep its “visitors in a state of disbelief.”
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to the site’s disclaimer, readers could have determined that the above-quoted article was fake by checking it against other sources. Oprah has not made any pregnancy announcement on her social media

  , nor has this rumor been covered by any major news publication.
