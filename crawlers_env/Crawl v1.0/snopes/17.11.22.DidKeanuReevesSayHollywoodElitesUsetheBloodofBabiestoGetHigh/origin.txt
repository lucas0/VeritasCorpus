  “The revelations that are coming out of Hollywood now, I’m telling you, they are just the tip of the iceberg,” Keanu Reeves said in Milan, Italy, where he unveiled three motorbikes that he designed for a company that he co-founded in 2007.

  According to Reeves, the number of Hollywood elites who engage in the ritual abuse of children and the practice of drinking their blood is not insignificant.

  “Some of these guys carry around bottles of blood. They call it ‘red wine.’ But they don’t hide it.“

  “From what I understand there is a supply chain that delivers young children on the regular. I’ve heard them refer to times of famine, times of feast.“
