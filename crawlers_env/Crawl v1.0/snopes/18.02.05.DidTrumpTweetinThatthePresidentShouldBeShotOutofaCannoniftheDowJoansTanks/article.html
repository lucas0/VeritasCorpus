  “Letters of Note” posted an

  on Twitter that purported to show Donald Trump opining that any president presiding over the United States during a stock market crash of more than 1,000 points should be “shot out of a cannon.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the image was intended to poke fun at now-President Trump’s prolific Twitter use and his timeline that has offered a running joke that puts his past criticisms of his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, in context with current events (such as a precipitous stock market drop a few hours

   Apparently quickly remorseful for the rapid spread of the inauthentic tweet, Usher tried to backtrack, humorously wondering if he could be arrested for creating a viral-but-fake post attributed to President Donald Trump:

  In a message sent via Twitter, Usher confirmed he was the tweet’s author and that it was not real. He told us:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Naively thought it too ridiculous to be believable. Says a lot, really. Was going to delete it but it was everywhere within minutes: feels like I need to leave it up in its place of birth.

  Creating

   fake tweets

  is extremely easy and can spread virally within minutes — as Usher has now demonstrated, even if unintentionally.
