 <p>
  MRS. OBAMA:  Good afternoon.  It is truly a pleasure and an honor to join you today for the third annual Global Education First Initiative event.
 </p>
 <p>
  Let me start by thanking Chernor for that just touching, very powerful, beautiful introduction.  Let’s give him a round of applause.  That was amazing.  (Applause.)  I do not feel worthy.  But I’m very proud of you and all of the other youth advocates for the tremendous work that you all are doing.  You make me proud.
 </p>
 <p>
  I also want to recognize Deputy Secretary General Jan Eliasson; UNESCO Director General Irina Bokova; U.N. Special Envoy for Global Education Gordon Brown; and, of course, the GEFI Champion Countries and Partners.
 </p>
 <p>
  But most of all, I want to thank all of you for your visionary work on global education, particularly on the issue I want to discuss today – an issue which is the focus of my international work as First Lady of the United States – and that is providing quality education for girls around the world.
