  In September 2016, numerous conspiracy-minded websites published near-identical stories describing the alleged discovery of a giant, fossilized human footprint in China. An example of such an article can be found on the website strangesounds.org, which
  <a href="http://strangesounds.org/2016/09/giant-human-footprint-fossilized-in-a-rock-discovered-in-china-pictures-video.html" target="_blank">
   stated
  </a>
  that:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   On August 24, 2016 a giant human footprint was discovered fossilized in a rock in Pingyan village in Chinaâ€™s southwestern province of Guizhou.
  </p>
  <p>
   One of the huge footprints discovered is 57 centimeters long, 20 centimeters wide and 3 centimeters deep.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  That story appears to have gotten its initial spark from a sparsely detailed post published on August 26, 2016, on the English-language site of the Chinese content aggregator
