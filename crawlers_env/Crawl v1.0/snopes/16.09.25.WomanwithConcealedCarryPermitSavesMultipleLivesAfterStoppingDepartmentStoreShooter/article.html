  On 24 September 2016, the Associated Media Coverage fake news site, which has now rebranded itself as the Boston Tribune,  published an
  <a href="http://archive.is/vEB7E/image" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  reporting that a woman with a concealed carry permit had saved multiple lives by stopping a department store shooter:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   37-year old Lisa Harris saved the lives of multiple people after using her concealed carry pistol to take down a department store shooter in Virginia.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to witness statements, the shooter, who has since been identified by police as 41-year old Randall Pierce, entered Bradford’s department store Saturday evening at approximately 5:10 PM.
  </p>
  <p>
   According information provided by Chief of Police Matthew Collingsworth during a press-conference, the security footage provided to investigating officers by the Bradford’s loss prevention department shows an agitated Randall Pierce walking briskly throughout the department store for approximately 6-minutes prior to retrieving a .223 caliber AR-15 assault style rifle concealed under his long-jacket.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  There was no truth to this report.
