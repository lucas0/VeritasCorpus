  On 26 February 2017, the
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/tag/seattle-tribune/" target="_blank">
   Seattle Tribune
  </a>
  web site published an
  <a href="http://theseattletribune.com/trumps-unsecured-android-device-believed-to-be-source-of-recent-white-house-leaks/" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  concerning President Donald Trump, reporting that his Android cell phone was believed to be the source of recent intelligence leaks from the White House.
 </p>
 <p>
  That article cited two non-existent “intelligence agencies,”  A.R.H. Intelligence and Z|13 Security, as its primary source, and hijacked the social media hashtag
  <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ditchthedevice" target="_blank">
   #DitchTheDevice
  </a>
  , which has been used to encourage cell phone users to spend more time away from their tech:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   If you’ve recently seen the hashtag #DitchTheDevice trending on social media, it’s because, according to several private intelligence reports, the source of the multiple recent leaks within the White House is President Trump’s unsecured Android device.
