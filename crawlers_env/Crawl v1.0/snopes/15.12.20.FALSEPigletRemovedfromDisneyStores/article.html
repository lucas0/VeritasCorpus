  On 18 December 2015, the web site
  <em>
   Elect Leaders
  </em>
  published an article reporting that Disney had removed figures of the
  <em>
   Winnie The Pooh
  </em>
  character Piglet from their stores in order to appease the Muslim community:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The usually inseparable literary duo of Winnie the Pooh and Piglet will be spending this Christmas apart in Disney’s Retail Store, to respect devout Muslim parents.
  </p>
  <p>
   Disney Stores throughout the United States have reported a number of demands for Pooh products to be sold without piglet to avoid problems over pigs’ unclean status in Islam.
  </p>
  <p>
   Disney has made a decision to appease Muslim complaints by removing all piglet items in it’s [sic] retail stores outside of the theme parks according to a employee speaking on the condition of anonymity.

  provided no evidence to back up their claim that Disney had pulled Piglet products in order to appease “Muslim demands.” In fact, a quick search at Disneystore.com
