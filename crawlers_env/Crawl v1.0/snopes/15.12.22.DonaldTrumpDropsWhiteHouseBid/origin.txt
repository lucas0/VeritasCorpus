  Donald Trump has been dominating the polls for weeks and has shown no sign of slowing down in this Presidential race.

  “I have never been a fan of politicians and just realized I was slowly becoming my own worst enemy. I’m dropping out of the race to leave a path for others to succeed since I am so awesome that nobody else could have stood a chance against me.”
