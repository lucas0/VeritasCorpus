  On 22 December 2015, the web site
  <em>
   Q Political
  </em>
  published an article reporting that Republican candidate Donald Trump had dropped out of the 2016 Presidential race:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Donald Trump has been dominating the polls for weeks and has shown no sign of slowing down in this Presidential race.
  </p>
  <p>
   So it came as a shock to everyone when he announced that he will be withdrawing from the race this week.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I have never been a fan of politicians and just realized I was slowly becoming my own worst enemy. I’m dropping out of the race to leave a path for others to succeed since I am so awesome that nobody else could have stood a chance against me.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
