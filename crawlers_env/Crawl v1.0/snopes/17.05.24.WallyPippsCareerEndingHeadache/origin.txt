  It was a long time between headaches. Wally Pipp had the first one. His head was buzzing when he reported to the Yankee Stadium on
  <nobr>
   June 2,
  </nobr>
  1925.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can’t play today, Hug,” the big first baseman told Miller Huggins, the mite manager.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Take an aspirin, Wally,” Hug said. “I’ll let that kid Gehrig fill in for you while you rest.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It sure was quite a rest. Not until
  <nobr>
   May 2,
  </nobr>
  1939, was the name of Lou Gehrig ever out of a Yankee
  <nobr>
   line-up.
