  Over 50,000 shares, 450+ comments and one Ellen Page mention later, it’s clear you folks are really responding to our original Bill Pryor story. (
  <em>
   Quick Recap: William H. Pryor Jr., one of Trump’s prospective Supreme Court nominees, issued a legal brief in 2003 that upheld a Texas law criminalizing consensual LGBT sex, which he compared to “polygamy, incest, pedophilia, prostitution, and adultery”. What’s more, he argued that states should be able to prosecute gay people as criminals. According to Pryor then, LGBT people as a group were not protected by the Constitution.

  Well it’s been little more than 24 hours and already new reports have sprung up about Donald Trump’s prospective Supreme Court nominee. Pryor is rumored to have appeared in a nudie magazine in the ‘80s, a claim he has vehemently denied.
