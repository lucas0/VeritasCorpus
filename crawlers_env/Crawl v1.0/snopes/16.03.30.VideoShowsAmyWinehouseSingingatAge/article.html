  A popular video showing a young girl with a melodious voice singing the

   standard
  </a>
  “What a Diff’rence a Day Makes” has been racking up millions of views since August 2015.  A claim that is frequently shared alongside the video is that it shows a young Amy Winehouse.

 <p>
  While the video does show a young girl with impressive vocal skills, that little girl is not Amy Winehouse at age ten, nor is it even a ten-year-old. The video shows eight-year-old Angelina Jordan performing on the TV 2 show

  The singer herself (who bears little

   resemblance
  </a>
  to Amy Winehouse at age eight, or any age, although Jordan’s deep, wide-ranging voice does sound like Winehouse’s) could be a clue that the video wasn’t her. Another is that the hair and clothing fashions are contemporary as of the mid-2010s, not at all resembling styles from 1993, when

  would have been ten years old.  Furthermore, the quality and style of the video is clearly high-definition, nothing at all like what might be shot on a consumer camera or even aired on television in 1993 or 1994.
 </p>
 <p>
  While we couldn’t uncover any videos of Amy Winehouse singing at age 10 to compare to the video of Angelina Jordan, a clip of Winehouse singing “Happy Birthday” at age 14 was included in the biopic
