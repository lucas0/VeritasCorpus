  We’re about to share with you something that will change your life, probably (and suck up any free time you have). There is a whole vault of unseen Facebook messages in your inbox you didn’t even know existed … Sounds suspicious and too weird to be true. But stay with us, and we’ll help you uncover them.

  OK, so you know how there’s a “message request” box in your Facebook messenger inbox where you can either accept or deny messages from people who aren’t your friends? Well, Facebook does some filtering of its own to decide which messages even pop up in that request section in the first place. Think of it like your email automatically sifts out spam.

 <p>
  This means there are potentially a huge pile of unseen (and unanswered) messages that didn’t make the “message request” cut. Who knows? Some of them might be useful … We just went through all the steps and found so many messages.
