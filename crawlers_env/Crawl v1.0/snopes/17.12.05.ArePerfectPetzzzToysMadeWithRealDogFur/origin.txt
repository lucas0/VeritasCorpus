  PLEASE don’t buy these. You know the little fake sleeping cat or dog that looks real? It IS real………Real dog and cat hair. And the animals the fur comes from are brutally killed JUST For this purpose. IF you see these in the stores this Holiday season you might want to let the store manager or owner know what really is going on. They may not be aware. And just “might” be an animal lover and want to send them back to China. THIS needs to stop. The “faux” fur collars you see on jackets, vest etc. MOST of them 90% are dog and cat fur. They can sell it cheap so it is used on or in coats, hats, and vests, purses.
