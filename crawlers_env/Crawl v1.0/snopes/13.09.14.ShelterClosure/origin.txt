  Please help!!!
  <br/>
  Please be advised that Huntington Beach Humane Society (the ‘humane’ part is questionable) is closing down for good on January 8 and ALL DOGS MUST BE ADOPTED OR THEY WILL BE EUTHANIZED. The shelter is not publicizing this very well (probably for fear of the bad publicity) so we need to spread the word. Please share this information with other animal lovers in the hopes that more animals will be adopted from there. If nothing else, maybe your funds can help move them to another humane facility….like in Irvine or San Clemente. The shelter is ‘selling’ the dogs for 50% off to move them out.
 </p>
 <p>
  PLEASE SAVE THE LIFE OF A PRECIOUS ANIMAL…..THERE’S ONLY 3 DAYS LEFT. Even if you can’t have one of your own, just forward this on to everyone you know and have them forward it on….you NEVER know who winds up wanting and getting a dog! I’ve been surprised numerous times by people who I never thought in a million years would get an animal!
 </p>
 <p>
  If you feel moved, just get in the car and go down there and look – anybody you know need a belated Xmas gift? You just might find your (4 legged) true love there!!!

  This is the Whatsapp message:
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hi guys. The Germiston SPCA is closing down due to a lack of funds. They’ve got about 250 animals there at the moment and unless they’re adopted or the centre gets enough money to keep running – those animals will, sadly, have to be put down. This includes kittens, puppies, grown dogs and cats, birds, hamsters, horses etc… It also includes animals at centres supported by the Germiston SPCA such as Kittie Haven, The Service Dogs Retirement Home and multiple other centres and rehabilitation centres. All in all it’s well over 1000 animals.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please, if any of you are looking to adopt or you know anyone looking to adopt – send them to the Germiston SPCA. Even if you’re not looking to adopt please spread the word to anyone you can. If you can, you can also make a donation on their website or you can even donate blankets, animal food, food bowls or carrier cages to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please spread the word everyone! There are a lot of animals that can be saved!”
