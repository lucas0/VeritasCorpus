  Multiple people began reporting a man who was believed to have bypassed security and made it onto the highly secure red carpet during the pre-show. This feat is nearly impossible as the Oscars is one of the highest profile events of the year.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the man casually strolled down the red carpet, a security team rushed in to take the intruder down and remove him from the event. As he was tackled, a pack of Marlboro cigarettes fell from the man’s pocket — bouncing off of the ground. He didn’t appear to resist any of the efforts of the security team, but could be heard screaming
  <em>
   “dig through the ditches and burn through the witches — I slam in the back of my dragula!”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Almost immediately, people nearby began speculating that the man was possessed.

 <p>
  There’s only one problem, it was actually Rob Zombie — a noted film director and legendary musician in the hard rock and heavy metal world.
