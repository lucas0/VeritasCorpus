  On 18 August 2016, the web site TMZHipHop.com published an article reporting that Donald Trump had said abolitionist Harriet Tubman’s face belongs on “a food stamp card” (i.e., an EBT card) and not the

   $20 bill
  </a>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “It’s the white thing to do.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Said Donald Trump who believes Harriet Tubman face is more deserving of a EBT card than a twenty dollar bill.

  <p>
   Donald Trump posted to his Facebook page that he believes Harriet Tubman’s face belongs on a food stamp card and America needs to stop punking out to the pressure of minorities and groups.

  While Trump, 2016 the Republican presidential nominee, did speak out against the

   decision
  </a>
  to update the U.S. $20 bill, suggesting that Tubman get placed on the $2 bill instead, he didn’t declare that the famous abolitionist’s likeness should be placed on EBT cards:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “I think Harriet Tubman is fantastic,” Trump said in an interview on NBC’s Today Show. “I would love to — I would love to leave Andrew Jackson [on the $20 bill] and see if we can maybe come up with another denomination. Maybe we do the $2 bill or we do another bill.”
