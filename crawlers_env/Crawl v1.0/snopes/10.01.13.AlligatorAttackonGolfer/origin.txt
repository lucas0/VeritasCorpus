<blockquote>
 <p>
  One of the alligators on Fripp’s Ocean Creek Course — a 10-foot, 400-pounder — turned aggressive when a 77-year-old man, the father of a Fripp Island property owner, knelt to pick up his ball and was attacked by the animal.
 </p>
 <p>
  The alligator clamped down on the man’s arm and dragged him into a nearby pond. The man lost the arm below the elbow in the struggle. Wildlife officials worked quickly to capture and kill the alligator, before cutting the reptile open to remove the arm from its digestive tract.
 </p>
 <p>
  The victim and his arm were flown to the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, where doctors tried to re-attach the limb.
