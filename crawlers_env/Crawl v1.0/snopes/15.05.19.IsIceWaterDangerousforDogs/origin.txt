  Acute gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) is a life-threatening condition, with fatality rates ranging from 10% to 60%.  The animals most commonly affected by GDV include older, large or giant breed, deep-chested dogs, including Great Danes, German Shepherds, Standard Poodles, and large mixed breed dogs.  Early diagnosis, medical stabilization, surgical intervention and post-operative monitoring are important factors in reducing the mortality rate.

  Gastric dilatation-volvulus is the result of accumulation of gas, fluid, or a combination of the two in the stomach.  Factors responsible for causing dilatation include aerophagia, exercise after ingesting a meal, and overeating.  The stomach distends with gas or fluid, and rotation along the axis of the esophagus and cardia follows.
