 <p>
  Vincent Ghambi, Malawi’s Deputy Minister of Defense has been hit with a sex scandal after it was revealed that he made a video while masturbating and sent [it] to US Pop star Beyoncé.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it is not established if the pop star got the video. Beyoncé receives millions of emails, and messages from her fans across the global.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the video, the Minister plays with his manhood and uttering Chichewa words, apparently saying “Jay Z can’t beat this.” He does this while displaying a kiss face and throwing flying kisses to the star.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally, Malawi’s leading news website Nyasatimes published the same story while referring to Beyoncé as ‘Sendera Sister’, a word that largely describes a group of old women that dance for Malawi’s ruling Democratic Progressive Movement party.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Minister has however denied the video saying “it has been doctored” by his political rivals to discredit his name.
