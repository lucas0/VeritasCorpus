  Possible shut down of the banking system

  Reliable word that Bank of America branch managers just received a message via the U.S. Federal Reserve Wire system from the US Federal Reserve instructing them to “perhaps be ready for a one-week universal shut-down of the banking system”, including access to checking accounts, savings accounts, credit cards and ATM’s. Reliable word also has it that BofA bank branches received a shipment of signs last week, reading “We’re sorry, but due to circumstances beyond our control, we cannot be open at this time.”

  This raises the likelihood of a ONE WEEK LONG bank holiday coming soon.

  It would be wise to have some cash around because checks, credit cards, CDs don’t work when the banks are closed and it appears ATM’s will be offline too. If you have CDs it might be worthwhile to cash them even though there is a penalty. If you have anything inside Safe Deposit Boxes in the bank that you may need, make certain you empty those safe deposit boxes tomorrow!
