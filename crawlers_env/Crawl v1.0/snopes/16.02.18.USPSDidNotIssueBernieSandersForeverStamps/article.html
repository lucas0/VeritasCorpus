   forever stamp
  </a>
  (which can be used to mail first class letters forever without having to buy additional postage, no matter what the going rate might be), the above-displayed graphic is actually a portion of an

   The deception is accomplished by means of incorporting a USPS Forever Stamp (a flag) into the design printed in the upper-right corner of the envelope. When the Forever Stamp is affixed in its designated place, the Bernie Sanders ‘stamp’ image has been completed.

  An image of the actual envelope, which was

  While the above-displayed envelopes are real, they still need a real stamp before they can be mailed via the United States Postal Service.

  This isn’t the first time that
  <em>
   The Comic News
  </em>
