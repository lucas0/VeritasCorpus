  Latifah Brown called 911 around 9:30 PM last night, reporting that she had a baby stuck in her vagina.
 </p>
 <p>
  The operator first assumed that she was giving birth at home and dispatched an ambulance to the site.
 </p>
 <p>
  The paramedics had quite a surprise when they arrived on the site and saw what was actually happening.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the paramedics, Brian Whitmore, related the incident in an interview with WBNS-10 TV.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The little boy wore a diaper and pyjamas, but he had his legs and abdomen stuck in the woman’s vagina.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The paramedics spent more than an hour on the site trying to release the child from his difficult position but were unable to get the toddler out.
