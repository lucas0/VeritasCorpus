  On 19 June 2016, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, a Republican who currently serves as Speaker of the House and will be chairing the Republican National Convention in Cleveland from July 18–21, appeared on the
  <em>
   Meet the Press
  </em>
  public affairs program.  During that appearance, Speaker Ryan was questioned at length by interviewer Chuck Todd about the possibility of a “Dump Trump” movement among Republicans that would seek to deny the Republican presidential nomination to Donald Trump at the convention despite Trump’s having already secured enough delegates to guarantee a first-ballot win.

  Chuck Todd opened the

   segment
  </a>
  of the program featuring Ryan with the following introduction:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Good Sunday morning and happy Father’s Day to all fathers out there. Like a canceled TV show, back for summer reruns, the Dump Trump movement has sprung back to life. Why? Well, just look at what’s happened in the past week. Item one, in the wake of Orlando, Donald Trump’s self-congratulatory tweeting and suggestion that President Obama may be in league with ISIS were universally criticized.
  </p>
  <p>
   Item two, our NBC News|SurveyMonkey poll among other polls is showing a sharp trend towards Hillary Clinton with Clinton now leading Trump by seven points in our poll, 49, 42. Item three, right now, while Trump is raising money and campaigning in states that haven’t voted Democratic in at least a generation, Hillary Clinton is up on the air with a $23 million, two-week advertising blitz in eight swing states.
  </p>
  <p>
   “But don’t worry,” Donald Trump says, he hasn’t yet started the general election campaign. And item four, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, whose interview with me you’ll see in just a moment — essentially is giving fellow Republicans a permission slip to vote their conscience and run away from Trump if they have to.
  </p>
  <p>
   Well, Trump reacted strongly to Ryan, and our follow-up conversation with him is coming up in a few minutes. But first, all of this is inspiring talk among jittery Republicans of yet another last-ditch effort to keep Trump from becoming the official nominee.
