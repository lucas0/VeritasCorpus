  Although stories like the ones presented above about snake owners being dangerously unaware that their pets are calmly sizing them up as the main courses of their next meals are interesting, they should be classified with other fictional tales of snake scarelore on the following bases:

  <ul type="DISC">
   <br>
    <li>
     Pythons don’t measure their prey before going after their meals: They grab, they squeeze, they eat. There’s little fretting in their nature about relative sizes of intended edibles, nor does all that much go into their thinking process.
    </li>
   </br>
  </ul>
 </p>
 <p>
  To look at it another way, if pythons were in the habit of measuring before striking, they’d likely starve. Most of their prey wouldn’t willingly wait for them to finish mimicking tape measures before consenting to be eaten; they would hop away to safety as soon as they noticed large snakes stretching out alongside them.
