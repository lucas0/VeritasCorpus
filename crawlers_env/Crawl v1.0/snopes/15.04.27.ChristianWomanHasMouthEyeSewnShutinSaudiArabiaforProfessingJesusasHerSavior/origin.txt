  A young woman working in Saudi Arabia had her eye sewn shut this weekend after she proclaimed that she was a Christian.

 <p>
  Sharia law in Saudi Arabia outlaws any speech that dissents from Islam. The woman proclaimed, “Jesus is my
  <nobr>
   savior” — a
  </nobr>
  phrase that’s considered abominable in Saudi Arabia.

  President Obama has chosen to stay neutral from this issue, but these Christians need a voice.
