  Given the terrible state of relations between Russia and the west, with the US having paid to foment the overthrow of the elected President of Ukraine, and our ongoing efforts to forcibly overthrow the President of (Russian ally) Syria, with NATO having surrounded Russia (after promising in the 1990’s not to do that) and now activating “Missile Defense” systems in Poland and Romania which are capable of shooting down Russian Missiles, have the Russians finally had enough abuse from us? Are they going to put an end to it using the ONLY language understood by the US Government and it’s NATO puppets? (The only language the feds understand is Force)
