  <em>
   TheStudioExec.com
  </em>
  reported that the second season of popular Netflix series
  <em>
   Stranger Things
  </em>
  would be written by horror author Stephen King:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   It was the hit of the Summer. A genuinely thrilling Netflix Original Series and everyone was crazy for it, with many commenting on how it was like vintage Stephen King filmed by vintage Steven Spielberg. Well now that comparison seems to have paid off as Stephen King, a declared fan of the show, has volunteered to script the entirety of Season 2 of the show.

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Established in 2012, the Studio Exec is a satirical movie based website, publishing spoof news, reviews and comedy masterpieces.

  <em>
   Stranger Things
  </em>
  was created by the writing team of Matt and Ross Duffer, and the Duffer brothers have made no announcements that they would be handing over writing duties to King — or to any other writers.
