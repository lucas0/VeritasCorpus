  Premise is also not associated with, has never had dealings with, and has no knowledge of T&amp;C Network Solutions. This all appears to tie back to mistaken internet information about a previous office address (645 7th St.) Premise occupied through August 2015 before we outgrew the space and moved to our current offices. We have no professional or donor affiliation with any political candidate.
