  PLAYBOY: For years American Indians have played an important — if subordinate — role in your Westerns. Do you feel any empathy with them?
 </p>
 <p>
  WAYNE:
  <strong>
   I don’t feel we did wrong in taking this great country away from them, if that’s what you’re asking. Our so-called stealing of this country from them was just a matter of survival. There were great numbers of people who needed new land, and the Indians were selfishly trying to keep it for themselves.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  PLAYBOY: Weren’t the Indians — by virtue of prior possession — the rightful owners of the land?
 </p>
 <p>
  WAYNE: Look, I’m sure there have been inequalities. If those inequalities are presently affecting any of the Indians now alive, they have a right to a court hearing. But what happened 100 years ago in our country can’t be blamed on us today.
 </p>
 <p>
  PLAYBOY: Indians today are still being dehumanized on reservations.
 </p>
 <p>
  WAYNE: I’m quite sure that the concept of a government-run reservation would have an ill effect on anyone. But that seems to be what the socialists are working for
  <nobr>
   now — to
  </nobr>
  have everyone cared for from cradle to grave.
 </p>
 <p>
  PLAYBOY: Indians on reservations are more neglected than cared for. Even if you accept the principle of expropriation, don’t you think a more humane solution to the Indian problem could have been devised?
 </p>
 <p>
  WAYNE: This may come as a surprise to you, but I wasn’t alive when reservations were
  <nobr>
   created — even
  </nobr>
  if I do look that old. I have no idea what the best method of dealing with the Indians in the 1800s would have been. Our forefathers evidently thought they were
  <br>
   doing the right thing.
  </br>
 </p>
 <p>
  PLAYBOY: How do you feel about the government grant for a university and cultural center that these Indians [occupying Alcatraz] have demanded as “reparations”?
 </p>
 <p>
  WAYNE: What happened between their forefathers and our forefathers is so far
  <nobr>
   back — right,
  </nobr>
  wrong or
  <nobr>
   indifferent — that
  </nobr>
  I don’t see why we owe them anything. I don’t know why the government should give them something that it wouldn’t give me.
