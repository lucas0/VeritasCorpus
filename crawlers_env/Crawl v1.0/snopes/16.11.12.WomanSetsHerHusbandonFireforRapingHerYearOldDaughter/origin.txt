  The man who was badly burned when his wife allegedly set him on fire is now facing sex crime charges.
 </p>
 <p>
  Renton police earlier said Vincent Phillips, 52, had been doused in gasoline July 17 while he slept in bed by his wife, Tatanysha Hedman. Investigators said Hedman then set her husband on fire.

  Phillips then fled their apartment and drove to a Skyway convenience store screaming “I’m on fire!” Customers looked on as Vincent Phillips dropped to his knees, clearly in agony and begging, “Help me!”
