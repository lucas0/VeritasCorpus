  Easter, the most important holiday on the Christian calendar, commemorates the resurrection of Jesus from the dead after his crucifixion by the Romans, as described in the New Testament. Easter is preceded by an approximately six-week period (46 days) of fasting, prayer, and penance referred to as Lent, which begins on

  varies from year to year, generally falling on the Sunday following the Paschal Full Moon (i.e., the first full moon of Spring in the northern hemisphere, or the first full moon occurring after the date of the vernal equinox). The earliest calendar date on which Easter can fall is March 22, and the latest date is April 25. Since Ash Wednesday is observed 46 days before Easter, it can fall as early as February 4 or as late as March 10.
