  California has just submitted to Obama in a truly sickening way by launching an unconstitutional gun-grabbing plan.
 </p>
 <p>
  California has officially launched its most unconstitutional program yet, calling it the Armed Prohibited Persons System.  The once supported system is gaining negativity as its true intentions are being played out and acted upon in the name of safety.
 </p>
 <p>
  The initial intent of the program was to disarm dangerous felons and people with serious mental illness but has since been modified.  The state of California has generalized these categories to include anyone who has committed a felony and anyone who has needed a psychiatrist or taken drugs that benefit your mental state. They then took these generalizations one step further by including anyone involved in a domestic dispute and anyone convicted of a minor misdemeanor.
