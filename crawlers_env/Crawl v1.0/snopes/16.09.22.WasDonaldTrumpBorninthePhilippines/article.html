  a satirical poem by humorist Garrison Keillor that included a line stating Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was born in the city of Manila in the Phillippines, and not in Queens, New York:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   <em>
    Donald Trump was not born in Queens,
    <br>
     He was born in the Philippines,
     <br/>
     In a hotel in downtown Manila.
     <br/>
     Where his hair turned bright vanilla
    </br>
   </em>
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The poem was not preceded or followed by any disclaimers labeling it as satire, leaving some readers fooled into thinking that Keillor was making a bold declaration about Trump’s non-American birthplace. However, the opening stanza made it clear that the focus of the poem was to mock Trump’s spreading of various conspiracy theories during the 2016 campaign:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   <em>
    I know, it seems outrageous,
    <br/>
    But it’s getting a lot of attention
    <br/>
    On some very respectable Web pages —
    <br/>
    Which mainstream media won’t mention:
